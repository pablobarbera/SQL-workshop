President Trump’s decision to end DACA is cruel and heartless. Undocumented students who were brought to the U.S. through no fault of their own are working, going to school, living their lives, and contributing billions to the American economy. Ending DACA in order to deport its nearly 800,000 recipients  is cruel and heartless.

President Trump has turned his back on these young people. Now is the time for Congress to stand up, speak out and have the courage to do the right thing.
