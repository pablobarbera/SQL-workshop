This Administration is no different. Yesterday, I voted for the Midnight Rules Relief Act to stop the Administration’s latest rules, which avoid transparency and circumvent the will of millions of voters who demanded change.   We must roll back harmful regulations like the Stream Protection Rule, which will destroy Ohio’s coal industry and thousands of good-paying jobs with it.

Looking to the future, it is my hope that the Trump Administration and subsequent administrations recognize and commit themselves to the bond we share with Israel and move to veto any U.N. resolution inserting itself into the peace process.

Currently, the Hyde Amendment prohibits taxpayer funding to pay for abortions, but it only applies to select government agencies and must be renewed on an annual basis. This legislation does three important things. First, it makes the Hyde Amendment and other abortion funding prohibitions permanent and government-wide except in the case of incest, rape, or if the life of the mother is in danger. Second, it ensures the Affordable Care Act conforms to the provisions of the Hyde Amendment.  And finally, until a new plan year begins, the bill requires each Obamacare health insurance plan to provide full transparency on the extent to which it uses taxpayer funds for abortion.   According to two recent studies by the Lozier Institute and the Knights of Columbus, two million Americans are alive today due to the Hyde Amendment and more than 60% of Americans believe that tax dollars should not fund abortions, including 4 in 10 Clinton voters.

Among the most recent offers:  James Raymond Keating, US Air Force Academy:  “The service academy nomination means that I have been chosen to attend an excellent academic institution to better myself to serve the country that I love.”  Seamus Kean, US Air Force Academy:  “The Service Academy and military service is important to me because I have done so much research, talked to so many alumni, and was able to attend a service Academy summer program (AIM) which all led to the same conclusion that this is what I want to do with my life.”  Michael Hercules, United States Merchant Marine Academy:  “To me, military service means defending our country and everything that it stands for.""  Joseph Cotner, United States Military Academy:  ""Being given the opportunity to attend a Service Academy is extremely exciting. It's important to mention the fact that I wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything without my family, friends, teachers and coaches. I'll always be thankful for the many blessings that allowed me to accomplish my life goal of attending a Service Academy.""  Nicholas Schmeller, United States Naval Academy: ""The real value of a nomination lies in the opportunity to serve my county in the Navy.  I believe that it is the most valuable form of civic duty to serve in the military, and I consider it my calling to fulfill that duty.”  On March 25th, my office will be hosting a Service Academy Day for students interested in attending a US service academy.

Robert Lighthizer.  I spoke about how trade policy effects Northeast Ohio because we are home to one of the largest dairy producing districts in the state. Ohio’s dairy sector relies significantly on exports. Today, some very unfair things are happening to our dairy farmers.  Canada’s protectionist policy is effectively blocking American dairy exports, by subsidizing Canadian milk proteins so that U.S. dairy farms are no longer competitive in trying to sell their product in Canada.  This is a concern not only to companies exporting to Canada but also to those exporting milk protein products around the world, since the Canadian pricing scheme is designed to undercut our sales on both fronts. I asked how we tackle this Canada dairy problem, and find a way forward to establish more open and dependable trading conditions.

The National Defense Authorization Act will not only provide the Department of the Defense with much needed funding increases to procure new and repair existing equipment but will also provide our troops with their largest pay raise in years.

Amanda is the director of REALIZE Firearms Awareness Coalition, a non-profit organization focused on teaching firearms safety. #WorkingWomenWednesday    1.  How long have you held your current position and what drew you into your specific field? I have been a director of REALIZE Firearms Awareness Coalition for about 4 years. Our motto is “everyday folks need guns for everyday reasons.” I am also a manufacturing engineer and quality manager. In my spare time, I enjoy competitive target shooting. I am drawn to the mechanical aspects of both firearms and engineering. I have always been strongest in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) and am grateful that I had mentors and family members who encouraged me to follow an nontraditional path in college and in my career. 2. What has been the most challenging aspect of being a woman in a male dominated field? Growing up as the first girl in a family of boys, I relate well with men. But, I have enjoyed being part of the growing sisterhood of women firearms owners. I like the mutual support we give one another, how we work together toward a common goal. 3. What is the most valuable thing you have learned from your job? Success comes from learning to work with others toward a common goal. Everyone does better when they have a supportive team beside them. Seek out networks of like-minded people in your field or create your own network. 4. Is there any advice you would have for young women who are inspired by your example of leadership? Seek out a mentor, someone you admire, and from whom you can learn. Pick a mission you are passionate about and don't look back. Be fearless and know that sometimes you will have to blaze your own trail.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2005289162830296/?type=3",NA,68,13,15,8,0,2,0,0

I applaud our Chair for putting forth a budget that actually balances over the next ten years and which includes policy proposals that will lead to badly needed economic growth in our nation.  This FY2018 budget also begins to address the greatest driver of our country’s growing debt by delivering real cuts to mandatory spending.  While I personally would have liked to include larger mandatory spending cuts, this budget is an important first step towards restoring responsibility and sustainability to America’s fiscal course.

This celebration marks the completion of an intensive program of closely supervised treatment and mentoring that these veterans need to repair their lives. By keeping veterans out of jail and prison, this program helps improve the lives of our service men and women, strengthen families, and better our communities.

Dean has worked for Dean’s Fence, Inc. for 15 years, with 13 years as a secretary/estimator and the past two as the general manager.  Over the years, Dean has gained much insight and has shared her thoughts on being a leading woman of industry:  “There’s so much I have learned from my career, but the most important thing is that I can’t control every situation, but I can control the way I react to it.  Being optimistic and positive in every situation is key.  I’ve also learned over the years that you should never let anyone tell you that you can’t do something.  The biggest lie you will ever believe is that you aren’t good enough.  If you are passionate about something, do everything you can to reach your goal.  Little steps in the short term amount to accomplishing a lot in the long run.”  It is my pleasure to recognize Maggie and her company for their commitment to serving our community.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2062930180399527/?type=3",NA,45,13,16,16,0,0,0,0

Kirkbride has been a private practice attorney for Kropf Wagner Law Firm in Orrville for 16 years, including being a partner for five of those years. She is also the Law Director of the City of Orrville for the past five years as well as the Solicitor for the Village of Smithville for the previous seven years. In addition to all the law work she does, she and her husband also own and assist in the operations of the The Inn at Walnut Creek in Holmes County Amish country for the past year. It is safe to say that she has a lot going on day to day, but she excels in everything, regardless of what is going on. Kirkbride shared with me her thoughts and insight based on her career experience in the law realm:   “The most challenging aspect of my career(s) is balance. My husband and I have 4 children, two of whom are still at home and the other two who haven’t been launched for too long. My job is extremely demanding – people tend to go to lawyers only after they have exhausted all other options and frequently tensions and emotions are high. Staying on top of client matters, communicating regularly, training younger lawyers and managing a heavy workload can be stressful. It is tough to keep all of the balls in the air and have something left for my family at the end of the day.   The most valuable thing I have learned from my job is to have empathy. People come to us in difficult times and everyone has a story. It sounds cliché, but as I have grown in my practice (and life), I have better understood the importance of taking time to listen to my clients’ concerns. I have also been able to share some of my family’s personal challenges with my clients – such as my father’s debilitating stroke and our long road following that event – to encourage and assist with resources of which they might not otherwise be aware.   My advice for young women would be that the Golden Rule never goes out of style. Treating people well, listening to their concerns, providing encouragement and support and becoming involved in your church, community, school , service clubs and non-profit organizations helps provide balance and rejuvenates your spirit.”  It is my honor to have Cheryl for this week’s #WorkingWomenWednesday.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2072374479455097/?type=3",NA,77,37,20,14,0,2,0,0

After working at Western Reserve Historical Society since 1995, Falcone-Hall was promoted to interim CEO in 2013 and eventually became the official CEO in 2014.  Falcone-Hall credits her passion in the museum field to her parent’s love of family and community history as a child, as well as her Cleveland State University history and political science professors during her college years.  Being a native to Cleveland, she believes that working every day to preserve and make her city and region’s incredible stories accessible to all is her dream come true.  Falcone-Hall shared with me advice for young women looking to get to the top of their fields:  “Focus on creating value for yourself and be indispensable!  Never settle for anything less than the absolute best from yourself, your peers, and your superiors.  Don’t apologize, unless of course you have done something wrong and then own up to your mistake immediately.  Turn the mistake into an opportunity for self-awareness and improvement.  Be very thoughtful about mixing your work life with your personal life, particularly if you aspire to leadership within your organization and your community.  Get involved in your community.  And finally, first impressions really do matter.”  Thank you, Kelly, for being our #WorkingWomenWednesday spotlight this week.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2081513308541214/?type=3",NA,10,1,9,0,0,0,0,0

Born January 29, 1843 in Niles, Ohio, he moved to Canton in 1867 and opened a small law office.  In 1869, he was elected prosecuting attorney of Stark County.  A few years later, he married Ida Saxton, of Canton.  Eventually, McKinley would be elected to Congress representing the 17th district of Ohio, which now does not exist.  It was redistricted at one point to our very own 16th district, but now most closely resembles the 13th district of Ohio.  Hailing from our local area, he would soon become Governor of Ohio in 1892, and then be elected President in 1896.  Unfortunately, McKinley would be shot on September 6th, six months into the second term of his presidency.  On September 14th, President McKinley would be pronounced dead.  He was then taken to a vault at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton before being laid to rest at the McKinley National Memorial in Canton, which you are able to visit today.  #TBT","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2081527921873086/?type=3",NA,41,6,6,2,0,1,0,0

Ten principles:  1. Make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand 2. Raise the standard deduction, increase child tax credits, and lower tax rates 3. Create cuts that touch all individuals and leverage higher rates of economic stimulus 4. Stop special interests from winning at the expense of the middle class 5. Make America the best place in the world to hire, invest, and grow 6. Support family business by eliminating the “Death Tax” 7. Retool the tax code to give American workers a level playing field with foreign competition 8. Switch to a territorial system that encourages companies to bring their profits back home 9. Encourage following regular order to ensure the greatest likelihood of success 10. Encourage all Americans to call on Congress and demand to put America first  You can read more and find full text here: http://bit.ly/2ytlITy  Here is the Resolution on its way to the Cloakroom:","video","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/videos/2094458353913376/",NA,82,48,17,8,5,2,0,3

She was kind enough to share her insight on being a leading woman of the education industry.  On the most valuable thing she has learned from her job:  “Collaboration works. The partnerships we have built at Kent State have paid off exponentially through the genuine exchange of ideas with community and education partners who share the same goal – preparing today’s students to be the leaders and innovators of tomorrow’s industries.”  On advice she would give to young women who are inspired by her example of leadership:  “Find good mentors and learn from their successes and their failures.  When you’re passionate about something, stay with it because you’ll find greater success in discovering your purpose and in using that passion to make a difference in the world.”  It is my pleasure to have Beverly for this week’s #WorkingWomenWednesday spotlight.

Before becoming a technical/production manager, Leslie previously served as an Industrial Engineer and a Continuous Improvement Manager.  Her experience has been predominately in manufacturing, but industrial engineering covers a very broad spectrum for opportunities to also work in health care, banking, and numerous other industries.Leslie shared her experiences with me as well as advice for other future female leaders.  On the most valuable thing learned from her job:  “When working with different levels of employees ranging from the production staff to the senior management and board members, it is important to have the ability to communicate with people at every level.  You have to learn to communicate effectively and that might be different depending on your audience.  Always know your subject matter when presenting information.  If you don’t know something, don’t pretend that you do.  If you don’t have the answer, then let them know that you don’t know but you will find out and follow up.  Always follow up!”  On advice for young future female leaders:  “Always treat people with respect regardless of their level of authority or influence. Everyone has something to contribute, so it is important to listen.  The best ideas don’t always come from the ‘experts’. Be professional and be true to your word.  You never know who is watching!  Be passionate about what you do.  I am fortunate to work for a company that designs and manufactures survival equipment and we are a supplier for the United States Department of Defense.  I am proud to know that my efforts are in some small way keeping our soldiers safe to allow them to protect our rights and freedom.”  Thank you, Leslie, for being this week’s #WorkingWomenWednesday spotlight.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2109416425750902/?type=3",NA,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This new legislation would prohibit abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest, and danger to the mother’s life. New evidence confirms what we already knew – by 20 weeks, an unborn child can already feel the pain of an abortion.  I firmly believe that life is a precious gift and that we must protect the sanctity of life, from the moment of conception on. As a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus, I am proud to serve as a strong and active advocate for the cause of protecting life and enacting legislation to preserve the rights of the unborn.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2110419692317242/?type=3",NA,220,105,35,34,1,1,1,37

Heidi has been with me since day one of being elected to Congress in 2011.  She is such a hardworking, passionate, and integral part of my team and I am so lucky to have her as district director.  I spoke with her about her career and her outlook as a leader in a government office:  On her career working for a member of Congress:  “I am extraordinarily proud to work for a Member of Congress. I have the opportunity to work with some very talented people and have gained valuable insights to the issues impacting our country.  I enjoy the opportunity to help people make government work for them. It’s so amazing to help solve a problem for someone when they were ready to give up. This job has given me the chance to meet some wonderful folks in person or on the phone and across our district. It all comes down to serving others.”  On an important experience on the job:  “Early in my tenure, Congressman Renacci held a meeting with our district office in which he was describing his priorities for each of us. He shared his philosophy of using the S.M.A.R.T. acronym to guide the development of measurable goals. This is something I see in many aspects of his policies that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-oriented. I appreciate that he has taught me this valuable lesson. Those who plan – succeed.”  Thank you so much, Heidi, for not only being this week’s #WorkingWomenWednesday, but also for making such an impact in the lives of those in the 16th district.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2119896051369606/?type=3",NA,58,9,4,5,0,0,0,1

In addition to her duties as program director, she also serves on the Ohio Attorney General's Task Force on Criminal Justice and Mental Illness Subcommittee on Veteran Treatment Courts and Military Affairs, the Stark County Bar Association Military Affairs Committee, Rebuilding Together Stark County, the Stark County Veterans Task Force, and CFW Post 1036 Auxiliary. I spoke with Lisa about her achievements and career, as well as any advice for future female leaders:  On the most valuable thing she has learned from her career:  ""The most valuable thing I have learned from my job is that people can truly change and that is something some may never experience firsthand in their lifetime. I have also learned that this community can come together with resources and assistance in ways I never imagined.""  On career advice for young women:  ""I would advise young women as professionals or students to always look for unique opportunities. I never imagined doing this kind of work, but now that I am doing it, I cannot imagine doing anything else. Network and find people with similar interests and discuss your hopes and dreams—or you may be overlooking an opportunity within your reach!""

In order to protect beneficiary access to rehabilitation services, I reintroduced the Creating Access to Rehabilitation for Every Senior (CARES) Act, which waives the 3-day inpatient stay requirement for SNFs that meet certain quality measures. If you really think about it, it’s ridiculous to think that this policy stood for so long in the first place. These patients are the frailest and oldest of the Medicare population. The three-day requirement is arbitrary as it holds no clinical basis. Not only that, but patients who need the services of a SNF most, are in essence forced to first meet the unnecessary hospital stay requirement.

On a personal note, I had the pleasure of being able to wish my mom a happy 91st birthday, celebrate 34 years of marriage to my beautiful wife Tina, and welcome a daughter-in-law to our growing family.  Wishing you all had a great 2017, and an even better 2018.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2228782370480973/?type=3",NA,70,29,2,9,2,1,0,11

The 115th House of Representatives has been one of the most productive in recent memory. Through December 15th, the House has passed 477 bills, which is 53 more than President Obama's first and 86 more than average. This is in addition to last week's passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a once-in-a-generation bill which reformed our tax code for the first time in over 31 years.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2236946716331205/?type=3",NA,67,110,27,4,25,0,0,34

I recently looked at some data and noticed three numbers that really stuck out to me: 800, 43000, and 1000.    In 2017, my office has had over 800 tour requests, sent over 43,000 messages to our constituents, and processed over 1,000 federal agency requests.  I am not only thankful for my staff's hard work over the course of this year, but am also thankful that you all have utilized the services my office provides and made your voices heard.    Thank you for a strong, impactful year.  I am looking forward to representing the 16th district in 2018.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjimrenacci/photos/a.705645446128014.1073741888.187639524595278/2238684516157425/?type=3",NA,17,13,0,0,2,0,0,1
