Mrs. DeVos said she supports the rollback of gun-free zones in schools, making students less safe. Her answer to my question about guns in schools, which went viral on the internet, was deeply troubling. And when asked about federal laws protecting students with disabilities, she failed to say she'd enforce them, which is beyond frightening for kids with disabilities and their families. The only thing more frightening is that her shaky answer on protecting kids with disabilities may have been caused by the fact that she didn't actually know we have a federal law protecting these kids.   But most importantly, I've heard from thousands and thousands of my constituents that they do not want Mrs. DeVos and the policies she is proposing anywhere near their children's schools. She has called public schools a ""dead end"" for kids. Sure, public schools need to get better, but we cannot have a Secretary of Education who will make it her mission to empty out our public schools and hand the reins of our kids' education over to Wall Street and for-profit school operators.

During her hearing, Mrs. DeVos showed a disturbing lack of knowledge about basic education policy and laws. She didn't seem to know what was required of states when it comes to educating kids with disabilities. She made it clear that she viewed the enforcement of civil rights protections for our kids as optional. She was confused about the difference between measuring growth and proficiency. And instead of talking with me directly about the danger of guns in our classrooms, she said she would support a federal law barring gun free zones in schools because of the threat of grizzly bears.   In all my time in Congress, I've never seen people in Connecticut respond to a nominee like they did after that hearing - 11,000 people called and wrote my office to oppose her nomination. Thousands more tweeted and shared messages and comments here on Facebook. Almost no one called to support her. That's remarkable.

You probably already heard that Elizabeth Warren was silenced by Mitch McConnell when she attempted to read a letter from Coretta Scott King on the floor. And while this action is concerning on its face, I want to talk about what it means in the context of this political moment we're living in.  We have a President of the United States who is a bully. He is using the power of his office to try and stifle debate. If you oppose him, he will mock you and degrade your reputation in an effort to silence you. We've seen him do it to ordinary Americans, elected officials, and maybe most troublingly to independent members of our judiciary system. President Trump's treatment of a judge in Washington who ruled against his travel ban shows a total disregard for the founding principle of our democracy - the checks and balances of independent, co-equal branches of government. It's an exceptional moment when the President of the United States is trying to bully judges into ruling in his favor.  I'm not trying to equate what happened on the floor of the Senate last night with what our President has done, but I want us to be very aware of efforts to stifle debate and quell opposition to this President, his cabinet, and his agenda. And while it may be true that the rules of the Senate don't allow you to talk about the conduct of a fellow Senator, how on earth can you debate a Cabinet nominee who happens to be a member of the Senate without questioning their conduct?  The continued effort to try to stop people who oppose President Trump and his agenda from speaking truth to power is not right. We are not going to stop talking about Senator Sessions' record, we are not going to stop questioning actions we see as threatening to our national security, and we will not be silent.","status",NA,NA,34200,2077,6493,3273,30,79,262,2082

Because today, the Senate voted to weaken our background checks system and get rid of a rule that seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of people with serious mental illness. The rule simply states that if you've been found mentally impaired to the point where you cannot work and are unable to manage your own financial affairs, then there should be a transparent, fair process for limiting your access to guns. Thanks to a vote in the Senate today, that provision will be wiped off the books.   90% of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, support a strong background checks system. They support keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people. No matter what state you live in, if you go sit down with your constituents and you tell them that you voted to allow people who are seriously mentally ill to be able to buy guns, you're not going to get a lot of takers.

Timmy Morrison was born just a few months after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Because he was born prematurely and with a genetic condition, he needed to stay in the NICU where he had multiple surgeries. Timmy would have run through his lifetime cap when he was just three months old. What do you do when your kid is in the NICU and all of a sudden you're on the hook for millions of dollars in medical bills?   Luckily, this is a question the Morrisons and thousands of other families never had to answer because of the Affordable Care Act. Because the law got rid of lifetime caps, it meant they could focus on getting the best care possible for their kid and not have to fear that they would go bankrupt because of medical bills.   Timmy is six years old now. As Republicans talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, his family is terrified that they will reinstate lifetime caps.

Allow me to count the ways that this plan will totally, completely, monumentally screw you.  1. You get a couple thousand bucks to help you buy insurance. That's it. If you aren't rich or healthy, you won't be able to afford anything.  2. But, it gets worse. When you can't afford your premiums because the tax credit is too small and your coverage lapses, you get a huge penalty when you try to sign up again.  3. Coverage mandates and penalties only work if you make insurance affordable. The leaked GOP plan cuts subsidies so much that the penalty is unworkable.  4. Mandatory benefits are repealed. So even if you CAN get insurance, it doesn't have to cover ANYTHING. Out of pocket expenses skyrocket.  5. Oh, and Medicaid expansion is effectively GONE. Millions and millions lose coverage and start using emergency rooms again for health care. Others die.  6. Finally, If you're older, your premiums go WAY up because the Republican plan guts premium protections for older consumers.  The Affordable Care Act helped 20 million people get covered for the first time. It held insurance companies accountable for providing care for everyone. And it made sure that the most important services would always be covered, no matter what. I agree that we can improve the law to make it better, but this Republican plan for repeal would be a disaster for millions of Americans.","status",NA,NA,3076,680,5677,25,6,140,1049,4036

And it suggests that President Trump is trying to undermine or influence the FBI's investigation into his campaign's possible collusion with Russia. It simply defies logic that President Trump, who led chants of ""lock her up,"" fired Comey because he unfairly handled the email case.  Here's what needs to happen next -- First, it's clear that now is the time for a special prosecutor. If the president refuses to support the appointment of a special prosecutor at this stage, it would confirm our worst fears about the motivation for Comey's ousting. Second, the Senate must insist that the new FBI director be a person of unquestioned independence, not a partisan lackey.

It doesn't matter if the bill says insurers can't charge sick people more if it allows insurers to not cover treatments for sick people. Without the essential benefits rule, insurers just won't offer someone with mental illness a plan that covers mental illness. The end result for people with preexisting conditions is the same - they don't get coverage for their condition. They get sick or go bankrupt.","status",NA,NA,812,116,715,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The provision of the ACA that limits lifetime caps on insurance took effect just weeks before Timmy was born, and thank goodness it did - Timmy racked up nearly two million dollars in medical bills before he even left the hospital. This isn't his fault. It's not his parent's fault. They did everything right, their kid just got sick. It could happen to any of us. But without this provision of the Affordable Care Act, the Morrison family would likely be bankrupt. No matter how much you plan or save, very few families can afford millions of dollars in medical bills. The latest version of the Republican health care bill would allow states to simply opt out of this part of the ACA, meaning that lifetime caps could come back. For families like the Morrisons, that also means the threat of bankruptcy comes with it.

Yet he intentionally keeps vacant every diplomatic position that is relevant to solving this crisis.  We have a President with no diplomatic experience, who chose a Secretary of State with no diplomatic experience, who chose not to hire anyone with diplomatic experience. Why are we worried about Trump's military threats? Because he's surrounded by advisors trained in military, not diplomatic, solutions to crises.  North Korea is one of the hardest problems out there. There is no obvious solution. But if a path exists, it'll be hard to find with gutted diplomatic leadership.","status",NA,NA,3609,519,835,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Today, each and every one of us must condemn that neo-Nazi rallies in Virginia and the violence against counter-protesters in the loudest and most unconditional terms.

Graham-Cassidy eliminates protections for people who are or ever have been sick. GONE. Insurers are allowed to go back to denying coverage for the sick.  2. Lifetime caps, annual caps, charging older people more - all the greatest hits of Trumpcare are back and in this bill.  3. Medicaid expansion vanishes. Millions will lose insurance, including loads of people with disabilities and children.  4. Premiums go up for everyone by 20% in the first year alone. If you're over age 50 or low income it gets even worse for you after that.   5. Graham-Cassidy is also a massive funding cut to states. In the next decade, it cuts $4 billion in funding to Connecticut. In order to cope with the cuts, states will either slash programs or raise taxes.  Bottom line: Graham-Cassidy is a bill that was written in secret, hurts millions and makes every problem in the health care system worse, not better. It's time for us to mobilize and stop it in its tracks.","link","http://gph.is/29hI8xo","gph.is",1365,284,1889,12,16,49,200,1075

It sunk further when I thought about the growing number of families in Las Vegas and Orlando and Charleston and Newtown, who have to relive their own horror every time another mass killing occurs.   The sinking feeling - the helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass shooting pings on your phone or scrolls across the TV screen. That feeling is not inevitable. I know this because no other country endures this pace of mass carnage like America. It is uniquely and tragically American.  But these shootings will keep happening if we continue to flood the country with dangerous weapons and consciously let those weapons fall into the hands of dangerous people. As long as the gun lobby assures that no laws are passed to make America safer, these killings will not abate.   Tonight, as my colleagues go to sleep, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets. They need to ask themselves whether they can claim to respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of their constituents.   My heart aches for Sutherland Springs. Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago. And Bridgeport. And Baltimore. Now is the time for Congress to overcome its cowardice and do something.","status",NA,NA,6167,1006,3152,312,7,12,2257,513

This event is always scheduled for early December, near the anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook. And coincidentally, these families were here today as the House voted on two gun provisions, which House leadership combined into a single bill. The first was our bipartisan Fix NICS Act, which would close loopholes in our background check system. The second was a concealed weapons provision that would allow people permitted to carry concealed weapons to carry them into any other state regardless of what that state’s law on such guns is. The first is supported by more than 90% of Americans. The other is opposed by law enforcement, ER doctors and the vast majority of Americans who believe that you should need to pass a background check or have some semblance of training to be able to carry a concealed firearm. But this has been the struggle of reforming our gun laws over the past five years. Thanks to the gun lobby, commonsense reforms are hard to pass, while unpopular NRA priorities are greenlighted by the Republican party.   But this is changing. Our movement is growing and it is strong. Politicians are realizing that they are out of step with their constituents. I believe this concealed carry bill will be dead on arrival in the Senate. And I'm hopeful that we can pass our bipartisan Fix NICS Act this year. The way we turn the tide is by showing up, sharing our stories and making our voices heard.   Tonight, I am grateful for the families from more than 20 states came to Washington to honor the people they lost to gun violence. I'm grateful for the advocates who have been relentless in their desire to make our country safer from gun violence.
