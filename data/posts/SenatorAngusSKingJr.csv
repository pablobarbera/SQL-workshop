The latest actions taken by this Administration, however, don't protect us, but actually compromise our nation's security. They only isolate America from our allies, marginalize this country's Muslim population who are often the source for information that helps prevent terrorism, and is inconsistent with who we are as a country. Worse, this order, which focuses exclusively upon majority Muslim countries, plays right into the hands of ISIS which has been trying for years to bait us into converting our opposition to their isolated brand of radical terrorism into a war of America against the entire Muslim world. Unfortunately, President Trump has taken the bait – and the fight against ISIS just got a lot harder.","status",NA,NA,2330,375,500,43,2,5,158,135

But it’s a crisis that can be avoided, too. And that’s why this legislation is so important.

We come together on this Memorial Day to express our lasting gratitude to these brave members of our communities for their service and to remind ourselves of the eternal debt we owe them. While many of us may be reminded each day by the empty seat at the table or the voice now unheard, we can take comfort in knowing that through our continued service to their fellow servicemembers and the veterans who have returned, the memory of our fallen heroes endures.   As we memorialize the patriotism, courage, and sense of duty of the brave servicemembers who no longer walk among us, may we also renew our commitment to the ongoing defense of the United States. With our country facing threats across the globe, our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coastguardsmen continue to vigilantly serve on our behalf, every hour of every day. Their sacrifice and willingness to answer the call of duty in the face of grave peril deserves our unceasing appreciation and support.    The Memorial Day ritual of laying flowers and wreaths at the final resting place of those who have died in the service of the Nation began during the Civil War, and has its origins in both Union and Confederate traditions. In the wake of the most divisive period of American history, the tradition of gathering to honor our fallen and to rededicate ourselves to supporting their fellow servicemembers was a unifying ritual—as it remains to this day. In the final months of the Civil War, in his Second Inaugural Address, President Abraham Lincoln expressed this unity, calling all Americans to, “bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” Let us today join together and heed this call to service as we remember the sons and daughters, of all eras, who fell in the defense of our Nation.      May God bless them, and may God bless the United States of America.","status",NA,NA,171,12,7,21,0,0,0,0

Whether it's boatbuilding, manufacturing or financial services, businesses in Maine rely on high-speed internet connectivity to grow and create jobs in their communities. The public-private partnership we see in Ellsworth oils the wheels of economic progress. This new open-access broadband network is a link to the region that will increase business opportunities and access to employment and it's something that I hope serves as a model for broadband infrastructure investments for towns and cities across Maine. As key to these efforts, I’ve identified four steps I think are necessary to closing the digital divide in rural America and across Maine.

In response, U.S. Senator Susan Collins and I wrote to Secretary Ryan Zinke asking him to reconsider the proposal. While the backlog is certainly an issue, asking Maine people to pay so much more to access Acadia is not constructive.   To fully address the backlog, we need to think bigger. That’s why I support alternative strategies like leveraging excess mineral revenues to create a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund or establishing a Conservation Service Corps that would engage veterans’ organizations and young people with volunteer-driven conservation projects on federal lands.

I love watching the faces of visitors as they first enter this space and look up -- even the jaded teenagers are momentarily awestruck. I can't help but note, however, that our work (especially lately) sure doesn't match these magnificent surroundings.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorAngusSKingJr/photos/a.143490589139522.31256.142803045874943/917669051721668/?type=3",NA,796,135,45,54,1,5,162,3

Following my letter to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services requesting an extension for Maine, they’ve agreed to allow residents affected by the storm to utilize a Special Enrollment Period that runs through December 31st. So please, if you missed out on your first chance, don’t let this new deadline pass without securing healthcare for you and your family in 2018.","link","http://bangordailynews.com/2017/12/19/health/mainers-hit-by-windstorm-outage-get-extra-time-to-enroll-in-aca-plans/","bangordailynews.com",265,49,173,29,0,0,0,0

We discuss Travis’s experience as a quadruple amputee and how that informs his Foundation’s work to help injured veterans regain a sense of purpose and direction, as well as Jack’s work with justice-involved veterans. These guys have a lot to say – it’s truly one of our best episodes.
