Your driver’s license allows you to drive in any other state or territory because you passed a written test and a driving test administered by the state of Arkansas. Just as your driver’s license ensures the right to drive in other states, a concealed carry permit should also grant the right to lawfully carry in any other state without the threat of prosecution. Shaneen Allen, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia who was twice robbed and beaten, obtained her Pennsylvania concealed carry. But she was stopped in New Jersey and faced five years in prison because she was carrying. This should not have happened and the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act will prevent it in the future. This common-sense legislation is supported by a variety of groups, including the National Rifle Association, National Gun Owners Association, and 73 percent of Americans. I was proud to support national concealed carry reciprocity and I will continue to stand for the 2nd Amendment in Congress.

Action has been taken by Congress this week that would tackle this and other problems in our civil litigation system. If we are to once again reestablish America the land of opportunity for entrepreneurs and dreamers, we must continue to improve the environment for job creators, which includes reducing and preventing frivolous lawsuits. In Arkansas, 49 percent of residents work for a small business. These reforms are necessary for each one of them and for all those who aspire to step out and create their own American dream free from frivolous litigation.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepWesterman/videos/991172561017861/",NA,29,40,1,0,0,0,0,0
