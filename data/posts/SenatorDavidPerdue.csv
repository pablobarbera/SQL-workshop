This past weekend, severe storms and deadly tornadoes tore through South Georgia, destroying homes and businesses and taking lives, unfortunately, of at least 15 Georgians. Among those areas hit the hardest were counties surrounding the cities of Adel and Albany. These counties and cities are very near where I grew up and where I now reside personally. When last weekend’s storms hit, emergency management teams there were still leading recovery efforts in response to deadly storms that had just caused widespread destruction earlier this month. I am very grateful for the tireless and ongoing efforts of our first responders in our state and stand with our Georgia families during this difficult time. Our hearts, of course, go out to the families affected by these severe storms.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorDavidPerdue/videos/567285760135819/",NA,248,28,45,14,0,0,25,3

Before anything can happen to address our nation’s immigration issues, we must first enforce our current immigration laws and secure our borders. Job one is to make it easier to remove felons who are here illegally and pose a risk to the safety of Americans. Simultaneously, our federal government should finally crack down on the hundreds of sanctuary cities refusing to enforce our laws by choosing to harbor criminals and illegal immigrants.

In Georgia, 96 of 159 counties only have one health care provider leaving consumers with no choice. Premiums have risen more than 105% because of Obamacare making healthcare unaffordable for so many Georgians. To make matters worse, just a few weeks ago, the only provider in those 96 counties announced it will be increasing premiums 41% next year. Due to the flaws of Obamacare, more than 300,000 Georgians today do not have access to the insurance they were promised.    This failed system isn’t going to fix itself, and I am glad the Senate has started a full debate on ways to improve health care.  For weeks, Democrats have refused to work with us on bipartisan solutions and today not one of them voted to help fix the damage they did to our health care system. The Senate's action this week is designed to increase competition, lower prices, and expand choices. Now that debate has begun, it is my hope Democrats decide to put aside their political self-interests and work with us to improve health care for Georgians and all Americans.","status",NA,NA,1355,2230,434,69,36,29,41,1233

The Senate had a real opportunity to dismantle the most damaging parts of Obamacare. As Republicans have railed against the failures of Obamacare for the last seven years, Democrats have failed to acknowledge any shortcomings of Obamacare and refused to try to fix a broken system.   Now, due to an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self-interests ahead of national interest, Obamacare remains the law of the land. This means that the poorest among us will continue to be fined because they can’t afford Obamacare. This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised. Additionally, this means the Medicaid expansion will continue as an open-ended government program that cannot be sustained.   The American people should be outraged and should demand real change now. It is extremely important that we get this fixed. We have to make sure people have access to affordable health care, which they don’t under Obamacare. We have got to work to reduce premiums, which have skyrocketed and priced people out of the market. We have got to put Medicaid on a sustainable path and make sure preexisting conditions continue to be covered. Those are the big objectives and nothing has changed.

In no circumstance can we allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and President Obama’s deal laid out a road map for Iran to do just that.   I applaud President Trump's action to decertify. Decertification gives the U.S. significant leverage at the negotiating table to get the international community on board to tackle non-nuclear issues‎ and to address shortcomings in the deal, like sunset clauses and inspection loopholes.   To be clear, this is part of a long-term regional strategy.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and I teamed up to author a bipartisan amendment to acknowledge our frustration with the budget process and the need to fix it. The U.S. Senate agreed unanimously that the budget process is broken. Getting the entire U.S. Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, to acknowledge the futility of the current budget process and the political side shows that come with it, is a step in the right direction.

We have a solemn charge to provide our veterans with the upmost respect and best care our country has to offer.   Unfortunately, for years the federal government failed to keep that promise. It is an open secret that the total lack of accountability at the VA jeopardized the ability of veterans to get timely and quality care. President Trump called this out and we have seen his administration work with Congress to tackle this head-on. This Veterans Day, I’m proud to say we are finally seeing a breakthrough.   Rules barring the VA from firing non-performing employees have been removed by Congress, and the new head of the VA has taken action to restore accountability. To date, 500 bureaucrats have been let go for poor performance. That’s great news for restoring trust between our veterans and the VA. We’ve also renewed the CHOICE program allowing veterans to seek out private care if they are unable to get it at the VA.   I’m proud to say that Georgia’s senior senator – my friend, Senator Johnny Isakson – deserves much of the credit for his work leading the Veterans’ Affairs Committee.
