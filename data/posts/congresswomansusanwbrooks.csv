The next four years will be dedicated to finding a better way to rebuild our healthcare system, strengthen the economy, address poverty, enhance our national security, and enact meaningful tax reform. Today, I have a lot of hope for the future of our country, and I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress and the Trump-Pence Administration to get Hoosiers back to work and to restore the American Dream for everyone. The United States of America is a nation of opportunity, and I am confident that with the Trump-Pence Administration, we will be able to harness that opportunity and make real progress for the American people.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSusanWBrooks/videos/1330681320312104/",NA,71,15,2,2,0,0,2,2

The Armstrongs were the only family in Indiana with 5 sons wearing the American military uniform at the same time during the war. The second oldest, Sgt. Irven Armstrong was a life-long educator. During his service in 1918, his students at IPS #17 wrote him letters which are the inspiration behind the Indiana Historical Society play, 'Sincerely, Sgt. Armstrong.' Sgt. Armstrong returned to Indianapolis after the war and continued to teach. He retired as head of the History Department at Crispus Attucks High School in 1959, and following retirement, he taught veterans of the Vietnam War.","link","http://www.indianahistory.org/events/sincerely-sgt-armstrong","indianahistory.org",59,4,3,5,0,0,0,0

Less than one week later it was discovered that this was not an isolated activity— sharing intimate photos without consent is a problem that pervades all branches of the #military. Last week, the House passed my friend Rep. Martha McSally's bill, the Protecting the Rights of Individuals Against Technological Exploitation (PRIVATE) Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor, that will better protect the #privacy of our servicemen and women. Current law does not clearly define when private photo sharing is a criminal act. This piece of legislation strengthens the Uniform Code of Military Justice by defining an individual’s right to privacy when it comes to consensual sharing of intimate media. That’s why this bill is so important.

Brooks","2017-10-31","2017-10-31 22:47:10","On the last day of #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth, please take a moment to read about a #breastcancer #Hoosier survivor: Michelle.   Michelle was a working, single-mother from Indianapolis, Indiana when her doctor found a cancerous cluster of cells in her breast. When Michelle shared her story with me, she explained how she never would have gone in for a mammogram at only 35 years old if it had not been covered by her insurance because she was unaware of a history of breast cancer in her family until after her diagnosis. After seeing a story in the IndyStar featuring the Indy SurviveOars, Michelle joined this group of #breastcancersurvivors and has found solace and comfort being able to talk with women going through the same struggles she has faced. The Indy SurviveOars is a group of local breast cancer survivors who practice dragon boat racing on Geist Reservoir in Indianapolis. I had the opportunity to join them at a practice earlier this year and meet Michelle.   While it’s easy to believe that Michelle’s diagnosis at such a young age is an outlier, unfortunately, Michelle’s story is all too common. There’s no way to predict if and when a woman will find cancerous cells in her breast. She could be 20, 30, 40, or 50 years old, the fact is we just don’t know. The Indiana State Department of Health reports that in Indiana alone, there are 4,400 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year. 4,400 Hoosiers who have to seek treatment, and fight for their lives. That’s 4,400 too many, but the good news is that early detection and diagnosis can lead to treatment. Many members of the Indy SurviveOars were diagnosed with breast cancer in their 30’s and 40’s, and they only discovered the cancer as a result of regular screenings, including mammograms.   Without a diagnosis, breast cancer can be fatal. But we do know that screening saves lives and that early detection helps women beat breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, “Breast cancer that’s found early, when it’s small and has not spread, is easier to treat successfully. Getting regular screening tests is the most reliable way to find breast cancer early.”   In 2009, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its guidelines to: (1) recommend against routine annual screening mammograms for women between 40 and 49 years old; and (2) recommend for biannual instead of annual screening mammograms for women between 70 and 74 years old. I believe the USPSTF’s recommendations are wrong and could limit critical access to lifesaving breast exams for millions of women.  That is why I introduced the Protecting Access to Lifesaving Screenings Act (PALS Act), in the House earlier this year. This important bill would prevent the USPSTF from limiting access to screening mammograms. The provisions in the bill were included in Section 226 of the final fiscal year 2017 appropriations bill that President Donald J. Trump signed into law on May 5, 2017. I am proud to have gotten the PALS Act language included in the final appropriations bill and postponing USPSTF’s misguided guidelines from taking effect until January 1, 2019. Since the PALS Act was signed into law as part of an appropriations bill, this is just a temporary fix. I will continue working to ensure a long-term fix that protects insurance coverage of screening mammograms for the millions of women like Michelle who need them.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSusanWBrooks/photos/a.523488674364710.107237.517697358277175/1610095192370714/?type=3",NA,12,17,3,0,0,0,0,0

The recommendations highlight the need for continued focus on preventing drug abuse in our communities and improving treatment services for those who are struggling with addiction. I agree that increased medical education for prescribers must be a priority moving forward, as their decisions to treat pain with addictive medications can potentially have irreversible and fatal consequences. It is now up to Congress to work with federal agencies to implement these recommendations so we can prevent the abuse of drugs and ensure addiction services are available to those who need them. The addiction crisis in this country will continue to cut our loved ones’ lives short if additional action is not taken.

Earlier this year, I traveled abroad with a small group of my female colleagues to meet female servicemembers over Mother's Day. One woman in particular left a lasting impression, Chief Master Sgt. Lisa Arnold. Lisa calls Anderson, Indiana in #IN05 home and is the first female command chief master sergeant to lead all U.S. airmen in Afghanistan. As more women come home from serving our nation, we owe it to them to make sure they can access safe, high-quality care.

You can watch our conversation discussing a number of topics: my work as Chairwoman of the House Committee on Ethics, specifically work dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace; a compassionate path forward for #DACA recipients; and the House's #TaxReform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. When asked by a caller to express my thoughts on Senate candidate Roy Moore, I told him what I have said before: I believe candidate Roy Moore should step aside and not stand for election.

Hardworking men and women have been burdened by our country’s broken and outdated tax code for far too long. And to ease that burden, today, the House of Representatives voted to provide Americans across the country with a fairer, simpler and modernized tax code that prioritizes the needs of families and encourages job creation throughout the United States. Relief is on the way.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act supports #Hoosier families. It establishes a new Family Credit, which includes expanding the Child Tax Credit, doubles the standard deduction and retains popular retirement savings plans. Soon, Hoosiers will be able to keep more of their paychecks and better plan for their futures.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act encourages job creation and economic growth in our country, instead of incentivizing companies to move overseas. Small businesses and start-up companies need the lower tax rates this bill delivers in order to thrive and prosper so they can create jobs and grow our economy.   Today’s vote is an important step to provide taxpayers in the Fifth District much needed relief. I am proud to have voted for a #taxreform plan that is pro-family and pro-business. I encourage the Senate to vote for tax cuts for all taxpayers in this country, especially those who need it most: low- and middle-income families.  https://susanwbrooks.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/relief-is-on-the-way-historictax-reform-passes-house","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSusanWBrooks/photos/a.523488674364710.107237.517697358277175/1624867207560179/?type=3",NA,289,337,38,26,10,3,38,243

These kids are exceptional – and I’m honored to be able to nominate them to our service academies. While their friends are applying to college, these young people are volunteering to serve their country during and after school – just as these men and women have volunteered their time and efforts to serve and protect us. The 59,000 Navy reservists are a critical part of our country’s defense. These men and women help to keep us safe from the threats that we’re facing both here at home and abroad. I am grateful for their dedication, commitment and service. They have chosen to serve here at home and to be deployed around the world – a choice that involves sacrifices from them and their families. Earlier this year, I was proud to support the National Defense Authorization Act which included provisions to promote readiness and strengthen our national defense. My top priority is security, and as threats to our nation grow more sophisticated and complex, it’s important for us to invest in protecting our cyber-channels as well as in modernizing and enhancing our #military capabilities and equipment. The #NDAA includes provisions that will help us realize this vision, including five battle force ships and contracts for more.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSusanWBrooks/photos/a.523488674364710.107237.517697358277175/1649381585108741/?type=3",NA,41,17,3,1,0,1,1,0

This bipartisan bill directs the Secretary of Energy to review and update a federal report on the energy and environmental benefits of the re-refining of used lubricated oil. I am proud the House passed this bill with #bipartisan support today because Americans across the country daily operate motor vehicles that rely on lubricated oil to run safely and efficiently. Our country is already re-refining lubricated oil through a process which rids the oil of harmful contaminants and restores the oil to its original effectiveness. Some of the nation’s largest vehicle fleets #recycle used oil for re-refining and procure re-refined oil, including the Department of Defense, U.S. Postal Service, National Park Service, and state and local authorities. In order to fully understand the benefits of recycling lubricated oil, we need an up-to-date report from the U.S. Department of Energy that will provide members of Congress with updated information that will better allow us to develop energy saving and environmentally conscious policy in connection with how our nation uses and reuses lubricating oil. Having an updated report will also allow companies in Indiana and across the country to have a better understanding on how they can anticipate the needs of the federal government and provide the best quality product for American consumers. https://susanwbrooks.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/brooks-bipartisan-re-refining-bill-passes-house-of-representatives","link","https://susanwbrooks.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/brooks-bipartisan-re-refining-bill-passes-house-of-representatives","susanwbrooks.house.gov",18,23,2,0,0,0,0,0

We are one step closer to providing  #IN05 Hoosiers with much needed tax relief. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) will deliver historic tax relief for Americans across the country and will boost our nation's economy. This is a pro-family, pro-growth bill. It expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. The #tax credit is refundable up to $1,400.  Combined with the new doubled standard deduction, families on the lowest end of the income spectrum will be able to keep more of their paychecks. It also preserves the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Adoption Tax Credit.  For those across the country who face expensive medical bills, our tax plan expands the medical expense deduction for 2018 and 2019 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, and continues to 10 percent beginning in 2020. https://fairandsimple.gop/","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSusanWBrooks/photos/a.523488674364710.107237.517697358277175/1656171544429745/?type=3",NA,85,208,7,5,2,0,13,94

For the first time in 31 years, we’ve simplified the #taxcode and passed significant tax cuts to benefit American families, workers and businesses.  I believe our communities thrive when our colleagues, neighbors, friends and loved ones have the freedom to pursue their dreams. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is family focused and allows taxpayers to plan for their futures. It will lower the tax burden for many individuals and families in Indiana so #Hoosiers can keep more of their hard-earned money.  We’ve provided unprecedented tax relief for American families by eliminating the ‘marriage penalty,’ increasing the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child, and expanding the medical expenses deduction for those who face high medical bills.  Our bill improves saving opportunities for education by allowing families to use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary and higher education. This bill does not tax graduate students on any reduced or free tuition they may receive from their institution.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is about encouraging the establishment and expansion of American small businesses. It allows for immediate expensing of new equipment to grow and improve their operations and provides a 20 percent deduction on pass-through businesses. Small businesses and start-up companies need the lower tax rates this bill delivers in order to thrive and prosper so they can create jobs, raise wages and grow our economy.  Settling for the status-quo is not an option. I am proud of my vote today that will help provide security for families and small businesses across the nation.
