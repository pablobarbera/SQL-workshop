The unit is between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at the arrivals level. Passengers can make their way there to have a temporary i.d. printed for the TSA identification process. This service is available for American license holders in all 50 states.   ----------------------------------------  There are many passengers who were at Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport during the tragic shooting Friday who were separated from their identification and belongings. The Transportation Security Administration requires a valid form of photo identification to travel. However, there is a process for passengers to verify their identity if they DO NOT have a valid form of photo identification from the approved list.   The Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is working diligently to reunite passengers with their belongings, however it is uncertain how long this process will take. If passengers need to travel before they reunite with their identification, they should follow the instructions below:  Here is the information from TSA FOR AMERICAN CITIZENS to go through the process of identifying yourself for travel purposes if you DO NOT have a valid form of photo identification from the approved list.   TSA STRONGLY advises passengers to arrive at the airport EARLY, leaving AT LEAST ONE HOUR to get through the alternative identification process if you do not have your valid ID.   FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION:  Please see our list of valid IDs here: bit.ly/1MKZXkb  If you don't have a valid ID from the ones listed there, please bring any supporting documents bearing your name. One of the items must bear a photo and identifying information such as an address, phone number, social security number, or date of birth. Items that would work as supporting documents include a credit card, social security card, insurance card, birth certificate, etc.  If you're unable to provide any type of identification, you'll be asked to assist in the identity verification process. To learn more about the process, please visit: bit.ly/1QpRx37   Temporary and Expired IDs are not valid as primary ID at security checkpoints. No worries, we have other ways to verify identity.   If you don't have a valid, unexpired ID, our officer will ask for 2 forms of ID bearing your name. One of the items must contain identifying information such as name, photo, address, phone number, social security number, or date of birth. Examples include a temporary or expired ID, a birth certificate, social security card, etc.   You may also be asked to assist in our identity verification process, if needed.

Sadly since that horrifying day, America has witnessed a stunning number of mass shootings that are disturbingly all too similar to that one.   This summer, we saw the largest mass shooting in American history in Orlando, where 49 people died and 53 others were injured. And on Friday, we added another mass murder, darkening further an already traumatic anniversary, when five more innocent people were brutally killed in cold blood after a gunman opened fire at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport in my own Congressional district. Six more were injured and countless travelers were traumatized.  The people of Tucson‚Äôs resolve did not break that day, and now my friends and neighbors here in South Florida will draw on that same resiliency and strength to get through this latest gun tragedy.   Today, my friend Gabby has made medical progress that few expected to see after what she went through that morning in Tucson. Like so many Americans, I've been fueled by her incredible strength, courage and determination ever since then, and even more so in just these last few days.   Since that brutal attack, Gabby has pulled thousands of concerned Americans - parents, neighbors and friends together in the fight to end our nation's gun violence epidemic. The events in my own community exposed even more vulnerabilities and significant challenges we still face in keeping people safe from gun violence.   I will redouble my efforts to put an end to the senseless gun violence that plagues our country. It disturbs me deeply that we have done so little to address mental health and common sense gun reforms that could dramatically reduce many of these tragedies. With Gabby's help, I'll work with my colleagues in Congress to do everything I can to change that.","link","http://www.azfamily.com/story/34209656/tucson-marks-solemn-shooting-anniversary-that-killed-6-wounded-13","azfamily.com",192,21,34,16,0,0,78,2

Unfortunately, his successor is moving us in the opposite direction. I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of that bill. But obviously, our fight was just beginning.   In Florida, women still earn only 85 cents on the dollar for every dollar paid to men for comparable work, and for minority women, the gap is even steeper. Florida‚Äôs African American women make 61 cents on the dollar for every dollar paid to white men, and the gap for Florida‚Äôs Latinas is even worse, at 59 cents on the dollar, according to a 2016 estimate.  As a mother of two daughters, it‚Äôs possible that neither one will reach pay equity with their male counterparts until they both near retirement, according to one study. Worse, those same inequities will shadow them throughout their retirement due to lower Social Security and retirement plan contributions  That‚Äôs simply not acceptable. The wage gap persists regardless of industry, occupation and education levels. And while I am proud to have cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would build on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act‚Äôs legacy by giving women the legal tools and protections they need to overcome a lack of transparency in wages, it‚Äôs not going to be enough.  Women not only need legal protections that enable them to identify and challenge discriminatory pay and employment practices, they need a minimum wage increase, and family-friendly workplaces that legally ensure access to paid family and medical leave, as well as paid sick days. Women also need affordable child care, and access to comprehensive reproductive health care. That‚Äôs how we erase the wage gap.  Unfortunately, we appear to be moving backward.

His initial pick is more troubling than inspiring in that regard.   Based on his rulings, Neil Gorsuch far more often sides with corporate rights over those of employees and consumers. As evidenced by his animosity toward the Chevron rule, which holds that courts defer to federal agencies‚Äô expertise when an act of Congress is ambiguous, Gorsuch sits to the right of Justice Scalia. Companies trying to shirk regulations will applaud that, but consumers and the environment could clearly face greater threats. Gorsuch has also sided against privacy and reproductive rights, as he did in the Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor cases. That same partiality will not bode well when it comes to protecting the rights of the LGBT community. He‚Äôs also written that liberal lawyers rely too heavily on the courts, instead of the ballot box, when it comes to protecting our #LGBT brothers and sisters.   Gorsuch must also be judged through the lens of the man who nominated him. President Trump has displayed open contempt for women throughout his adult life, and during his campaign. For  POTUS to place someone on the High Court who has been so antagonistic to women‚Äôs reproductive rights is truly alarming.  Having witnessed just two weeks of Trump‚Äôs quasi-dictatorial presidency, it‚Äôs highly likely Gorsuch will also hear cases that test the limits of executive power. Given that and the decades-long impact Gorsuch would have on the lives of all Americans, I stand strongly with other House Democrats in opposition to his nomination and urge the Senate to reject him for a seat on our nation's highest court.   Just as important as the substantive reasons to reject Judge Gorsuch's nomination is the fact that this seat should not even be available for nomination. The Republican obstruction that took place during the last year of President Obama's term was outrageous, and irresponsibly left the Supreme Court hobbled with eight members and interfered with justice being administered as our Founding Fathers intended.

David Friedman will bring only a lengthy record of conflict and provocation to the job.  Friedman has likened liberal Jews to ‚Äúkapos,‚Äù a term used to refer to Jewish prisoners who worked for the Nazis during the Holocaust. He‚Äôs called President Obama an anti-Semite, and referred to Jewish Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer as an appeaser. Though he apologized for his ‚Äúhurtful‚Äù remarks before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Friedman obviously lacks a deft diplomatic voice.  But it‚Äôs not just his words that disqualify him. As Republican Sen. Bob Corker pointed out, Friedman has recanted nearly every strongly held belief he‚Äôs had on major, sensitive Israeli regional issues. Though he‚Äôs strongly endorsed settlements, Friedman now says he agrees with Trump‚Äôs recent comment that they ‚Äúmay not be helpful.‚Äù As for a two-state solution, which he also opposed previously, Friedman now says it may be the best hope for peace.  Five former ambassadors under Republican and Democratic presidents have deemed him unsuitable for confirmation, citing his ‚Äúextreme, radical positions‚Äù on these and other issues. Worse, unlike his predecessors, Friedman lacks diplomatic experience; his major credential appears to be handling legal work for Trump‚Äôs casinos. The President has an abysmal early record on Jewish issues. He‚Äôs hired a senior strategist best known for running a media outlet that gives voice to anti-Semitic rhetoric. Trump unconscionably failed to mention Jews in an International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement, which his staff has stunningly justified.  And the president was also unacceptably slow to denounce a growing tide of anti-Semitism that‚Äôs coincided with his rise to political prominence. Now Trump is potentially upending decades of American Middle East policy by backing away from a two state-solution to secure a lasting peace. I fear that adding the extreme and provocative voice of David Friedman to his policy team is just another flawed move by Trump, and it will only make a lasting peace more elusive.","status",NA,NA,21,10,5,1,0,0,3,4

Wiggins and his wonderful congregation.   First organized in 1909, Greater Mount Zion has a rich and inspirational history.    Not soon after establishing its home in 1923, the church was demolished by a hurricane three short years later, leaving only a bible and the pulpit standing.  Church members worked faithfully and were determined to rebuild, even if only in spirit and worship, and under the stewardship of several pastoral leaders, the Greater Mount Zion family always pressed forward together.  Throughout the 1940s and 1950s Greater Mount Zion flourished as a spiritual beacon for Dania Beach residents and in the 1960s, a building fund was started with just five hundred dollars. This fund would increase over time and help the church continue to expand and grow until a permanent church home was built.   The resilience and determination of Greater Mount Zion is testament to the character and steadfast faith of leadership and parishioners alike.  They never allowed temporary setbacks to hold them down. With their unshakeable faith and hard work, members gained new strength with each year and in 1986, with the groundbreaking of a beautiful new church, they witnessed a dream become a reality.  Today, under the leadership of Pastor Wiggins, Greater Mount Zion has elevated its congregation with an enthusiastic spirit to meet the needs of all its members - from the elders who persevered to keep the congregation alive to the new generation who follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.   It is with great admiration that I commend the visionary leadership of Greater Mount Zion AME Church and offer my heartfelt appreciation to the members for keeping the hopes and dreams of its founders alive for a century.    Thank you for being a blessing and bright light for so many in Broward County and congratulations on one hundred and eight luminous years ‚Äì may you celebrate and serve the needs and spirits of many for years to come.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDWS/photos/a.425155824121.216346.88904724121/10155037232674122/?type=3",NA,51,9,2,3,0,0,0,0

This basically abandons any families who have a lapse in their coverage due to a lost job -- or for any reason at all.

The women who worked to make this world a better place ‚Äì more just, more fair, and more kind.  Many decades ago, there was no one who came before them to show the way.  They had to be the ones to decide how to shatter the glass ceilings and make it possible for the women who came after them to follow suit and break even more new ground.  One of these women who paved the way for future generations is Dr. Sheila L. Chamberlain, a constituent of mine from Hollywood.  Dr. Sheila L. Chamberlain has the distinction of being the U.S. Army‚Äôs first African-American Woman Combat Intelligence Pilot.  Having served three tours in the Republic of Korea and Latin America and served active duty during the Grenada/Panama Invasion, Ms. Chamberlain‚Äôs distinguished 15-year military career has led to numerous recognitions including the National Defense Medal, the Tuskegee Airman Blades Award, the General George C. Marshall Award and the Meritorious Service Medal.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, Dr. Chamberlain was part of a unit sent to assist South Floridians.  It was during that time that Dr. Chamberlain retired from the military and was asked to provide testimony before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee on women pilots in combat.  When asked if she wished to continue her military career, she replied ‚ÄúI have survived and hopefully this will open the door for future women who just want to fly for their country.‚Äù  And opening the door was exactly what she did for generations who follow.    In addition to serving her country, Ms. Chamberlain holds a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law and a B.A.  degree  from  Spelman  College  in Atlanta with Post graduate studies in Public Administration from the University of Oklahoma.  Dr. Chamberlain‚Äôs remarkable career in our United States Armed Forces has helped knock down so many doors to opportunity for future generations of girls and women.  Her advocacy on behalf of women from all backgrounds will continue to inspire countless generations of girls to pursue their passion, never losing sight that all is possible to anyone who has a dream.

Of course, just one veteran taking his or her own life is one too many. But 20 every day is an epidemic.  It is unconscionable, and simply unacceptable. With two-thirds of veteran suicides being carried out with firearms, this bill practically pulls the trigger for veterans at risk.   H.R. 1181 threatens the safety of our nation's veterans and potentially others; by providing those veterans suffering from mental illness with greater ease in obtaining a firearm.   The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is a critical tool in stopping those who want to do harm to themselves or others. If it becomes law, this bill would dangerously alter the protocols for including a veteran in the database when he or she has been assigned a fiduciary.  In addition, over 170,000 mentally ill veterans would be removed from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.   Instead of wasting time and energy on senseless budget cuts and harmful bills like H.R. 1181, this Congress should be focused on strengthening protocols so that no veteran struggling with mental illness ever falls through the cracks.  Just two months ago, a veteran, Esteban Santiago, suffering from  mental illness fell through the cracks and killed five people at my home airport in Fort Lauderdale. The current protocols failed him.   We failed him, and we should be doing all that we can to make the system strong for those suffering‚Äî not making the situation worse, as this bill does.   This bill does a grave disservice to those men and women who have served us valiantly. Moreover, it is opposed by military leaders including General Stanley McChrystal and General David Petraeus, who led our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.   It is our obligation to ensure that every veteran has the physical and mental health care they both deserve and need. We owe them better than this.

A Fort Lauderdale resident, Maureen‚Äôs commitment to keeping Florida‚Äôs families healthy extends well beyond her full-time profession.

More importantly, for millions of individual Americans, Trumpcare would have been devastating.

It was the worst bill for women‚Äôs health in a generation. In fact, for the entire health care system, it would have been a nightmare.

It marks just how far into the next year that a woman has to work in order to earn the same wages a man earned in the previous year. That disparity is now 80 cents on the dollar, which means it took 94 days to reach this point.  For women of color, the gap is even wider, with African-American women earning an average of 63 cents, and Hispanic women making 54 cents compared to white men.  This gap is a national embarrassment.  It not only affects women ‚Äì it affects  the whole economy because American women are the sole or co-breadwinner in two thirds of all the families with children.  When women‚Äôs wages are depressed, families can‚Äôt adequately pay for groceries, rent, utilities, health care and child care.  Worse, the lost wages compound throughout a woman‚Äôs life, totaling an average of $418,000 by retirement. That‚Äôs the equivalent of a home mortgage, or college tuition for a family‚Äôs children. And this same disparity chases behind women into retirement, too, since they receive less Social Security or retirement payouts due to a lifetime of depressed wages.  But there is a way to address this inequity. Democrats are calling upon Congressional Republicans to work across the aisle for every woman in this country by passing the long-overdue Paycheck Fairness Act. This law would update the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and provide effective legal remedies to the millions of women who are not being paid equal wages for the work they do that is equal to men every day.

According to a National Law Center on Poverty & Homelessness survey of social service providers who handle housing issues, more than 10 percent of evictions and more than one in four housing denials involved victims of domestic violence because of the crimes committed against them. Unfortunately, current law does not adequately protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault from eviction for the disturbances or damages caused by their abusers.  ‚ÄúToo many women who are in the midst of trying to escape or recover from sexual and domestic violence face the daunting challenge of just finding a safe place to live, often under economic duress caused by the very same abuser,‚Äù Wasserman Schultz said. ‚ÄúAdding to the pain and hardship they face by allowing them to be evicted from their homes is immoral and reprehensible. We can help end that compounded discrimination with this legislation.‚Äù  In recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, a companion bill authored by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) was reintroduced in the Senate today. Shaheen first introduced the bill last year.  ‚ÄúThis bill ensures that domestic violence and sexual assault survivors have necessary access to housing, enabling them to feel safe as they build the next chapter in their lives,‚Äù said Smith.  The Fair Housing for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Survivors Act would build on existing legal protections in the Fair Housing Act and the Violence Against Women Act by establishing a nationwide standard to ensure that victims of domestic violence and sexual assault cannot be evicted or somehow penalized for being victims of these heinous crimes.  This legislation would provide clear authority and direction to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to protect domestic violence and sexual assault victims from housing discrimination, and expands these protections beyond public and affordable housing to private dwellings as well.","status",NA,NA,26,3,4,4,0,0,0,0

Syria has indisputably become a hotbed for terrorist activity, propped up by Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah. Both ISIS and al-Qaida are operating near the Syria/Israel border, putting both the Jewish state and our regional security interests at risk.  Although the missile attack was warranted, I have serious concerns about the Trump Administration's irresponsible statements earlier in the week, which may have emboldened Assad, and an overall erratic policy that indicates there is no longer-term strategy in place here.  For these reasons, I support our nation exercising the moral leadership that makes us a beacon of hope to the rest of the world. However, we must also lead by example, which means ensuring we uphold our Constitution. To that end, if President Trump believes it is in our national interest to engage in further hostilities against the Assad regime, he must obtain an authorization for the use of such force from Congress.  He also must present Congress with a clear and comprehensive strategy to end Assad‚Äôs dictatorship.","status",NA,NA,89,28,5,1,0,0,1,6

Every Passover, we gather with family and friends around the Seder table to read the inspiring stories of our people‚Äôs liberation from slavery in Egypt. We tell this story because it informs who we are.   As we go through the traditional Seder, each food we eat and word we say holds significant meaning.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz","2017-04-13","2017-04-13 21:15:01","Today President Trump endorsed yet another legislative attempt to weaken women's access to vital health care services. For nearly four decades, Title X has ensured that a vital safety-net of family planning funding is available to health providers who deliver quality care to low-income women, especially those who are uninsured or under-insured with nowhere else to turn. Title X funds go to providers who offer birth control, cancer screenings, and other vital services to 4 million people.  Unfortunately, states have targeted certain Title X health providers such as Planned Parenthood to block them from receiving this funding. In my state of Florida, Republican lawmakers have already tried to end Medicaid enrollees' access to family planning services by Planned Parenthood, which serves more than 67,000 patients each year in Florida. For many of these Floridians, Planned Parenthood is the only health care provider they have, and public funding such as Medicaid and Title X is the only way they are able to access this affordable care.  And if that isn't enough to know that Trump's action today will have devastating effects on women across the nation, we need only look to Texas, where the attacks were successful and led to the loss of 54% of patients at specialized family planning clinics in just two years. Providers reported that many of these patients were unable to find other health centers to meet their basic health care needs and went without lifesaving screenings like breast and cervical cancer screenings, as well as sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.  By signing H.J. Res. 43 into law today, Trump killed a regulation designed to reiterate that no qualified health providers could be denied this funding. Earlier this year Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy, a global gag rule which basically prohibits U.S. funding to global family planning groups that provide information on or pay for abortions with private funds.  This has gone on long enough. Women and men across the country are tired of these Republican attacks on women's health services. In poll after recent poll, three out of four Americans say they oppose defunding Planned Parenthood. It's not surprising that Trump, for once, hid from cameras when he signed this dangerous legislation. This sexist campaign by Republicans to erode women's health and reproductive rights must end.","status",NA,NA,38,12,13,2,0,1,7,14

It‚Äôs crucial that we increase climate science fluency, wean ourselves from fossil fuels, and embrace a green jobs economy that provides productive, innovative employment, while protecting our environment.

We take this moment to not only pledge to never let their memory fade, but solemnly rededicate ourselves to never allowing something so evil and heinous to occur again.  On this day, we also honor the survivors and those who fought against this unspeakable, malevolent mass crime.  As a Jew, policymaker and elected representative of one of the largest survivor populations in the United States, I have strived to dedicate myself to providing Holocaust survivors with the financial and social services that they need to live in dignity.  As this last generation of Holocaust survivors pass from this world, our moral responsibility to keep their memories alive becomes more sacred and essential. The resurgence of anti-Semitism, and bigotry toward religious and ethnic minorities makes that mission more urgent and vital than ever.  I believe one of the most crucial ways we can honor the lives we lost, and those valiant survivors still with us, is to unite and ensure that nothing resembling these horrific atrocities ever happens again. That sacred promise of ‚ÄòNever Again‚Äô is something that must motivate us this day and every day as we confront hatred and violence, and protect the weak and persecuted.

Trumpcare 2.0 would provide less care with much higher costs. It would make tens of millions of Americans sicker and poorer, and unravel much of the progress Democrats made in creating a more affordable, equitable and compassionate health system. And, shamefully, Republicans did it with demonstrably false claims about who this bill would hurt, and without any hearings or an official nonpartisan estimate of its fiscal impact.  What we do know is this: 24 million more people would be left without coverage and millions more Americans with preexisting conditions would lose their coverage and face skyrocketing costs. Trumpcare 2.0 would create an ‚Äòage tax‚Äô for older adults (50-64), and open up anyone with an employer plan to annual and lifetime coverage caps -- all while funneling hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthy and big corporations.  This rushed, ill-conceived and dangerous proposal by Donald Trump and Paul Ryan has been panned by nearly every patient and medical advocacy group in America, including AARP, the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the Children‚Äôs Hospital Association, Planned Parenthood, the American Cancer Society and an array of religious groups.  Put simply, almost no one would be spared from the harm this bill inflicts. As this painful, costly truth becomes clearer, Senators would be wise to let this Trumpcare 2.0 bill die a natural death, and start over with an open, honest attempt to improve the Affordable Care Act to provide affordable quality healthcare to even more Americans.","status",NA,NA,62,22,14,1,0,0,10,23

The misleadingly-named Financial CHOICE Act that Republicans passed today flagrantly abandons those basic responsibilities. It guts the Dodd-Frank safeguards that Democrats passed in response to the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, financial protections which we know have worked for nearly a decade. Tellingly, America has not faced a similar economic crisis since, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was created as a result, has returned billions of dollars to tens of millions of Americans.  Now is not the time to adopt Donald Trump‚Äôs dodgy Wall Street de-regulation schemes. Main Street simply cannot afford them. Most families work two jobs just to keep their heads above water, all while struggling to balance family duties. They don‚Äôt have time to read all of life‚Äôs fine print. For Republicans to weaken America‚Äôs financial self-defense systems, and re-open the door to Wall Street abuses, is an unforgivable betrayal. Families and investors deserve a fair marketplace to operate in.

I am pleased that House and Senate negotiators have finally reached an agreement that will allow us to pass this critical legislation and move forward with strong sanctions immediately, because time is of the essence. Waiting for President Trump to respond to this historic attack on our democracy is simply not a realistic option, and the ability of any Member of Congress to force a vote if the President tries to waive the sanctions is a strong and important safeguard.   Additionally, as a proud cosponsor of the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, I firmly believe that implementing these sanctions against Iran are a critical step in holding the regime accountable for its unacceptable violations of international law. This bill will strengthen sanctions targeting Tehran's ballistic missile activities, and punish Iran for its various violations of human rights, its illicit arms transfers, and for its de-stabilizing support for terrorists, including Hezbollah, which has killed more Americans than any terrorist group other than Al Qaeda, and borders our greatest ally in the region, Israel.
