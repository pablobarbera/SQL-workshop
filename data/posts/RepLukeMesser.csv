More specifics can be found here: http://bit.ly/2wAMZF2   • First, any future decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan will depend on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables. The President wants America’s enemies to know they can never wait us out or doubt our resolve.  • Second, the new strategy will integrate all instruments of American power—diplomatic, economic, and military—in a way that is sustainable and cost-effective. We will bolster the fighting strength of government forces by providing advisors to Afghan brigades and additional combat air support in order to convince the Taliban they cannot win on the battlefield. This will set conditions for the ultimate goal of our strategy: a peace settlement between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban that protects our interests.  • Third, our approach with Pakistan will change: it will reflect the commonsense understanding that no partnership can survive a country’s tolerance for militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. Any country that takes this course will be held accountable.  • New strategy will also emphasize developing our strategic partnership with India—the world’s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner.
