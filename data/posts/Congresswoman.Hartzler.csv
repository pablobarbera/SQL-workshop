Instead, they’ve skyrocketed, With average premiums rising by 25 percent for benchmark plans on the federal exchange, and over 20 points in Missouri.  Families are having to decide whether to purchase insurance they can't afford, or pay a fine. For rural Missourians, it could be even worse.  Obamacare is hurting Americans.  We are working to bring immediate relief to Americans and pass legislation to bring more choices, lower costs, greater control over your health care. We need to move health care decisions away from Washington and to where they belong: with patients, their families, and their doctors; give patients the right tools, like health savings accounts, to make their health care more portable and affordable; break down barriers that restrict choice and prevent Americans from picking the insurance plan that is best for them and their families; and empower small businesses to provide employees with the kind of affordable health coverage that meets their needs.","link","http://bit.ly/2ibBzh8","bit.ly",136,152,78,2,0,4,11,49

The bill, House Joint Resolution 43, uses the Congressional Review Act to return power to state governments to decide which healthcare providers are eligible for Title X funding awards.  There are number of reasons this rule needs to be overturned. Chief among them is that the rule forces states to send taxpayer funds to abortion providers. The rule, which was finalized in the “midnight hour” of the Obama Administration, stripped states of their right to direct funds to healthcare providers that do not provide abortion.  This rule is nothing but a veiled attempt to funnel taxpayer dollars to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. That’s not healthcare. State governments should be able to distribute funds to meet the needs of their constituents. They should be able to decide to not use these funds for abortion providers.  Overturning the rule doesn’t cut funding for Title X services. Funds are still allocated to the states as they have been, but states would now be able to direct those funds that were previously mandated to go to abortion providers to other Title X providers.","video","https://www.facebook.com/Congresswoman.Hartzler/videos/1538640929494557/",NA,107,65,11,14,0,0,0,24

I took some time this afternoon to take your calls and listen to what you had to say. I have heard from many on all sides of this issue, and I believe this bill is the first step towards building a fair system that empowers Americans, not the government, to make their own health care decisions.  Obamacare is failing. It is collapsing under its own weight. In Missouri the average individual market plan premium rose by 28% in 2017. Nationwide premiums rose by 25%. Insurers have left the marketplace each year since Obamacare was put into effect, leaving 96 of Missouri’s 114 counties—84 percent—with only one provider to ‘choose’ from. Obamacare is not working for far too many.  We can do better and we must do better. The American people deserve it.  No bill is perfect, but this is a good start. I will continue to listen to my constituents as this bill progresses through the legislative process and I will continue to advocate for the best health care system possible for everyone.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Congresswoman.Hartzler/photos/a.243491672342829.68877.183580061667324/1581412098550773/?type=3",NA,187,189,14,6,4,1,4,34

Collection sites have been set up in communities throughout our district and our state. I strongly urge anyone with prescription drugs no longer needed to dispose of the medication at one of the many drop-off locations.

In a visit to an elementary school in Virginia today, Perdue announced increased local control of guidelines over whole grains, sodium, and milk, noting the restrictive nature of the current policy while committing to further review and possible additional policy changes in the future.   Today’s decision by Secretary Perdue is a welcome first step towards returning local control to nutrition policy. Schools throughout my district have faced financial and regulatory barriers, which have made it increasingly more difficult to meet the strict nutrition requirements put forward by the federal government. USDA’s own figures point out that in 2015 alone school food requirements mandated by Washington cost school districts and states an additional $1.22 billion. This incurred cost on schools is made worse by the fact that most states report decreasing participation in the school lunch program. This means additional loss in revenue for schools at the same time they are trying to meet these costly standards.  As is so often the case in Washington, the federal government tries to paint policy with a broad brush instead of deferring decisions like this to local and state government. I am pleased Secretary Perdue recognizes this and I look forward to working with him to further empower local schools.","status",NA,NA,66,34,4,4,0,0,0,10

Despite decades of work protecting his community, and annual testing and requalification with a firearm, once he clocks out of work he is prohibited from using his training to protect his grandchildren when he visits them at school.

Requiring certain benefits from insurers, even if they were unnecessary and unwanted, is just one example of how the law made the health insurance business extremely expensive. Obamacare broke the healthcare system, and state by state, the system is collapsing. This time, the continued failure of Obamacare will personally impact thousands of people across the state.

The majority of federal employees are hardworking public servants, but that is not always the case. In those instances where bureaucrats become bad actors the process to fire them can take over a year because it is so administratively complex. Sometimes, the dismissal is delayed indefinitely.  This bill would also allow the VA to take back an employee bonus or reduce the pension of a former employee who has been involved in illegal activity. It will also shorten the appeals process which can drag on for years. Additionally, VA staffers who “blow the whistle” on wrongdoing will have new protections against retaliation.

Committee approval of HR 2480 moves the bill closer to full consideration on the House floor in July.    “Sex trafficking crimes are a rising epidemic in America, but our federal grant system has not kept pace with the seriousness of this issue. We must empower our police in fighting this nationwide epidemic. When the law enforcement community says there is an opportunity to rescue sex slavery victims — which sadly includes children — then there is no excuse for ignoring it. This legislation provides us an opportunity to rescue countless lives from the sex trafficking industry and move one step closer to ending this evil forever."" Last month, I met at the White House with the Department of Justice, State Department officials, and Ivanka Trump, who is assisting the president on this issue, to discuss ways to more aggressively combat the rising tide of sex trafficking crimes both in the United States and abroad.    Specifically HR 2480 expands the ability of the Department of Justice’s Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program (Byrne JAG) to enable law enforcement agencies to compete for federal funding, specifically to develop and carry out programs that fight sex trafficking demand.   Demand reduction programs pose police officers as women engaged in street-level prostitution to capture buyers seeking to exploit these victims. The average support team consists of about six officers for each decoy. Police may also post decoy advertisements online, and set up reverse stings at a hotel or apartment. All of these strategies drain precious law enforcement budgets.    “Every life matters and has inherent worth, and we must do all we can to fight human trafficking. The Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act ensures that state and local law enforcement officials have access to additional tools needed to fight this heinous crime in their communities. I thank Congresswoman Hartzler for her work to fight human trafficking and look forward to her bill being voted on by the House of Representatives in the coming weeks,” said Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.","link","https://judiciary.house.gov/press-release/house-judiciary-committee-approves-bill-fight-human-trafficking/","judiciary.house.gov",71,45,9,6,0,1,0,3

Twenty weeks is a milestone for babies. Babies at this age, in utero, are hyper-responsive to pain. This means that they feel pain more acutely than a one-year old child, or you or I do as adults. This is not lost on surgeons who operate on young patients in the womb. In fact, best medical practice routinely administers pain medication for unborn children undergoing surgical procedures. Our bill stops these unborn children from having to endure this inhumane, painful procedure.  We also know that pre-term babies born at 20 weeks have a chance of survival outside the womb. These children are the future doctors and nurses, the future scientists who will develop cures and the teachers who will train generations to come after them. These unborn children will grow up to serve honorably in our military and grow up to be mothers and fathers with children of their own. It is a tragedy to allow their lives to be snuffed out.

This year alone, 77 U.S. service members have been killed in readiness related accidents — we must invest in our forces now so that we’re equipped to effectively respond to and deter our enemies in the future.","status",NA,NA,81,47,7,7,0,1,1,13

A caller asked what Congress is doing about veterans and opioid addiction, and I wanted to tell all of you about some provisions in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) that address this issue. CARA expanded the grant program for veterans treatment courts, substance use treatment programs for veterans, and other programs for the treatment and rehabilitation of veterans with substance use disorders. Additionally, the bill allows these court programs to include intensive judicial supervision and case management for these vets.  I am committed to helping our veterans and doing all I can at the federal level to address the opioid epidemic.

After the Senate votes on this historic tax reform, it will go to the President before Christmas, and families will see relief as soon as February. For too long, families have just ‘gotten by’ instead of ‘getting ahead’— this bill will change that by bringing jobs back to our country and increasing paychecks by growing the American economy. Main street businesses will be taxed at 21%, the lowest rate in years, which will allow them to hire more employees and pay them higher wages. Our bill will also lower tax rates for every income level and double the standard deduction.  The tax bill is especially important to Missouri families. It increases the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and lowers tax rates for every income level in America. It also doubles the standard deduction, which 71% of Missourians use. The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act would also undo Obamacare’s individual mandate, which caused Missourians to pay $50 million in fines in 2015. It’s important to give Missourians not only relief from high taxes, but also relief from government mandates that require them to buy health insurance they do not want nor can afford.  I'm also pleased to announce that I successfully worked to ensure graduate student tuition waivers would not be taxed in the final bill and that the adoption tax credit would be maintained.","link","https://hartzler.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hartzler-praises-house-passage-historic-tax-reform","hartzler.house.gov",315,245,31,59,3,2,4,166
