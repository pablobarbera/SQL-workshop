Recent news reports indicate that President Trump may soon terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a decision that would put nearly 1 million immigrant youth across the country at risk of deportation.  The American Hope Act would:  ·         Allow DACA beneficiaries and other immigrant youth to apply for conditional permanent resident status (“CPR status”).  ·         Allow those granted CPR status to obtain full lawful permanent resident (LPR) status (i.e., a “green card”) after 3 years if they stay out of legal trouble.  Time spent as a recipient of DACA would count toward the required 3 years with CPR status.  ·         Provide a 5-year path to U.S. citizenship.  Time spent in CPR status would count toward the general 5-year period needed for permanent residents to become eligible for U.S. citizenship.  ·         Allow minors to apply for CPR status through a legal guardian or counsel.  ·         Improve college affordability for undocumented youth and other immigrants by repealing rules that limit their access to in-state tuition and college loans.  ·         Treat all immigrant youth who arrived in the United States as children the same, regardless of educational level, military service, or work history.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJackyRosen/photos/a.773777549438437.1073741828.766794650136727/920621278087396/?type=3",NA,108,32,13,14,2,2,1,1

It’s the end of the year, and there is no valid reason to further prolong this uncertainty. This process has devolved into a disgraceful charade and enough is enough. We need to address the problems in front of us and stop irresponsibly kicking the can down the road. I have been a vocal supporter of many of the programs that are in the continuing resolution, including CHIP, but this funding bill fails to fully reauthorize the program and does nothing to reassure families who may very well still receive notice that their child has been dropped from coverage. Congressional Republicans have already done permanent damage to CHIP and must come to the table with a clean reauthorization instead of leaving parents in a panic and the program hanging by a string. We are also running out of opportunities to fix President Trump’s cruel and heartless decision to end the DACA program. For months, Speaker Ryan has refused to bring a clean DREAM Act to the floor for a vote, even though it has Republican buy-in and would pass with broad bipartisan support. DACA recipients contribute to our economy, study at our universities, bravely serve in our nation’s military, and reflect the very best of our American values. We must bring immediate relief to the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers who risk being deported from the only home they’ve ever known. An estimated 122 DREAMers are losing their protected status every day that we fail to act - more than 12,000 already have so far.
