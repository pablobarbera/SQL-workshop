As a superintendent of an urban school district, the last thing I wanted was the federal government telling me what to do. But I believe we have a profound national interest to ensure that more than only 9 out of 100 kids born into poverty are able to obtain a college degree. We also have a profound national interest to attract the next 1.5 million teachers to teach, especially in our high poverty schools in our cities and rural communities.  There is nothing in conversations with Betsy DeVos, or in her experience in Michigan or Detroit, that gives me confidence that she can lead us in the direction we need, which is to ensure that every kid in America has access to high-quality education, whether or not they are born into wealth. That is why I will vote against this nomination.

Democrats are committed to working in a bipartisan way to accomplish responsible tax reform that actually grows our economy and creates jobs.

The Senate passed a tax bill that has been sold to the American people with falsehood after falsehood. Republicans claim this is for the middle class. It is not. In its first and best year, those with incomes over $1 million receive an average tax cut of $59,000 under this plan, while those who earn less than $50,000 receive just $160. It gets worse from there.   Republicans claim this plan pays for itself, just like they claimed when they cut taxes in 2001 and 2003. It won’t. Instead, this plan borrows over $1 trillion from our kids and grandkids.  It is the sons and daughters of Colorado’s teachers, firefighters, and police officers who will have to pay back that bill. And for what? To end poverty in America? No. To invest in infrastructure or health care? No. To strengthen our safety net? No. But to fritter it away on tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America.   All of us have a job to do: leave more opportunity, not less, to those who’ll come after us.
