However, I am optimistic there are opportunities for the President and Congress to work together.  I am especially pleased to hear that the President wants to make childcare accessible and affordable, ensure parents obtain family leave, invest in women’s health, and rebuild our infrastructure.   Earlier this month, some of my congressional colleagues and I requested a meeting with the President to discuss ways to improve our nation’s aging infrastructure.  If the President is serious about this issue, he will find a willing partner in me and many of my fellow Members of Congress.   I continue to be concerned about the President’s undisciplined approach to national security, which undermines rather than enhances our safety.  I also did not see a realistic plan to replace the Affordable Care Act—only a politically-motivated effort to eliminate health care coverage for millions of Americans and send our health care system into chaos.  Right now, the American public is calling for unity, cooperation, and results.  I stand ready and willing to work with the White House and both parties in Congress to put good public policy above partisan politics on issues where we can find common ground.  I encourage the President to do the same. #FL07","link","http://stephaniemurphy.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=43","stephaniemurphy.house.gov",174,18,13,8,0,0,0,2

TrumpCare takes health care away from 24 million Americans, while the rest of us pay more for fewer benefits. Older Americans will be especially hurt, and people with pre-existing conditions will be put at risk. This bill offends my conscience and hurts my constituents, and so I voted no.  I want every American to have access to quality, affordable health care, but this bill falls far short of that goal. We should work in a bipartisan way to strengthen what works in the Affordable Care Act and fix what doesn’t – not dismantle our health care system with a hyper-partisan bill negotiated behind closed doors and passed without a single public hearing or cost analysis.  “Virtually all patient advocates, physicians, hospitals, and independent health care experts, including the AARP, opposed this bill.

Here is a recap of what to expect in the next few days:  Irma Local Watch/Warning Statement/Advisory Number 38 National Weather Service Melbourne FL  1131 AM EDT Fri Sep 8 2017  ...HURRICANE WATCH IN EFFECT...  A Hurricane Watch means Hurricane wind conditions are possible somewhere within this area and within the next 48 hours  **WIND LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Cat 1 Hurricane force wind *Peak Wind Forecast: 60-80 mph with gusts to 95 mph *Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Sunday afternoon until Monday afternoon  **CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Extreme *The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the previous assessment. *Emergency planning should include a reasonable threat for major hurricane force wind greater than 110 mph of equivalent Category 3 intensity or higher. *To be safe, aggressively prepare for the potential of devastating to catastrophic wind impacts. Efforts should now be underway to secure all properties. *Extremely dangerous and life-threatening wind is possible. Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury, loss of life, or immense human suffering.  **POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Devastating to Catastrophic *Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. *Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and roadway signs blown over. *Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes impassable. *Widespread power and communications outages.  **FLOODING RAIN/LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: *Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 8-12 inches, with locally higher amounts  **CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Moderate *The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from the previous assessment. *Emergency planning should include a reasonable threat for moderate flooding where peak rainfall totals notably exceed amounts conducive for flash flooding and rapid inundation. *Rescues and emergency evacuations are possible. *To be safe, earnestly prepare for the potential of significant flooding rain impacts. *Dangerous flooding is possible. Failure to take action may result in serious injury or loss of life. If flood related watches and warnings are issued, heed recommended actions.  **POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant *Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and rescues. *Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swift currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches will overflow. *Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations. Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions will become hazardous with some road and bridge closures.  **TORNADO *Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes  **CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Elevated *The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the previous assessment. *Emergency planning should include a reasonable threat for isolated tornadoes, mostly with shorter and narrower damage paths. *To be safe, prepare for the potential of limited tornado impacts. *Listen for tornado watches and warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly if a tornado approaches.  **FOR MORE INFORMATION: *Family emergency plans: Federal Emergency Management Agency: https://www.ready.gov *Local weather conditions and forecasts: http://www.weather.gov/mlb","link","https://www.ready.gov/","ready.gov",23,0,8,1,0,1,4,0
