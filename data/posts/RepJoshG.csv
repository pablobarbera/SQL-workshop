""Give me the room number, and I'll be there to dig in. But the bill we have before us now, AHCA, is not the solution.""  Gottheimer said the AHCA, in its current form, was ""basically a major tax hike bill for New Jersey residents.""  ""This plan could trigger a massive state tax hike -- to the tune of $4,000 per New Jersey family -- while sending even more of our hard earned federal tax dollars to moocher states and increasing costs for millennials, seniors, and everyone in between,"" Gottheimer said. ""Health care is already too expensive, and our taxes are already too high. But the bill the House is considering will only exasperate those problems. We can't afford it.""  Citing a report from New Jersey Policy Perspective, a non-partisan public policy research organization, the freshman congressman said the AHCA would cost the state $8.8 billion over the next decade to maintain the current levels of Medicaid service that was the direct result of that program's expansion under the ACA.  ""This plan could trigger a massive state tax hike,"" Gottheimer said. ""That's unacceptable considering how much we already pay in taxes.""  He also talked about increased costs for seniors -- stating that insurance premiums could rise five-fold for the seniors -- and millennials, an age group that is ""most likely"" to be hit with a 30 percent surcharge for coverage lapses as a result of moving, changing jobs or being removed from their parent's insurance.","link","http://www.njherald.com/20170323/county-congressional-reps-disagree-on-health-bill#","njherald.com",129,31,11,3,0,0,0,4

We must do everything we can to protect funding for this program that not only keeps our seniors independent and secure but also is fiscally responsible. Its common sense approach actually pays for itself. By seniors staying at home and out of hospitals, it saves billions of taxpayer dollars in Medicare and Medicaid.  Meals on Wheels decreases the rate of falls, which cost our nation $34 billion each year. For the cost of a senior spending one day in the hospital, Meals on Wheels can provide a year’s worth of meals to a senior.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoshG/photos/a.386444985026908.1073741828.385195211818552/426761537661919/?type=3",NA,190,5,6,12,0,0,0,0

We have 6,730 bridges in our state.  1,684 bridges, or twenty-five percent of them, are classified as functionally obsolete. Our state is second-in-the-nation, percentage-wise, of commuters who rely on public transit; yet, NJ Transit had more trains breakdowns last year than any other commuter railroad in America.   I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to spur the infusion of infrastructure investment our nation needs, without raising taxes.   So, I recently introduced a bill – The Partnership to Build America Act -- that would give a one-time lower rate, as part of our overall tax reform, to get those dollars back home, so we can invest the revenue into our roads, rails, tunnels and bridges.   This is an approach that everyone from labor to business to local governments can get behind. And it does it without raising taxes one dime.  It’s not a Democratic or Republican plan; it’s a win-win, good for the Fifth District plan, good for New Jersey plan, and, of course, good for the U.S. plan.  Thank you to the business and labor leaders who joined with me, as well as Senator Loretta Weinberg and Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoshG/photos/a.386444985026908.1073741828.385195211818552/442349222769817/?type=3",NA,43,4,6,0,0,0,0,0

In 2014, they received a $600,000 grant through the Department of Justice’s Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, grant program. At the time, Paramus did not have a Member of Congress who was willing to advocate on their behalf to the federal government to secure funds like these. But they were lucky enough to have a neighbor in Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr. to fight to get them those resources that allowed them to hire five officers.  Well, I’m pleased to report that Paramus’ current Member of Congress has a different position from his predecessor on this issue.You now have a friend and a tireless champion.  I am committed to doing everything I can to make sure our law enforcement officers, and all first responders, get the resources they need to do their jobs effectively.

It is because of the sacrifices made by these men and women and their families that the American dream lives on today.    We can never adequately express our gratitude to those service members who gave their lives in the service of the United States. But we can start by keeping our promises to today's service members, who have committed themselves to keeping our families safe.  Earlier this year, I was proud to author an amendment that passed the House of Representatives to help post-9/11 veterans seeking employment while improving the quality of care the VA provides to all our veterans. I am committed to fighting on behalf of all veterans and men and women in uniform to ensure they receive the care and benefits they have earned and deserve.

The science is clear. When children are exposed to lead, their development could be delayed, they face learning disabilities, and appetite and weight loss. In the worst cases, children could develop permanent damage to their kidneys and nervous systems. They could experience seizures, hearing loss, and vomiting. And the greatest risk is to brain development, with subtle and irreversible damage.  Bills like Cory Booker's and my own Lead-Free Schools Act will make sure that our schools can protect our children.  Like so many local issues, this just isn’t partisan. It’s not a Democratic or Republican issue. It’s a Fifth District issue. It’s a mom and dad issue. It’s an American issue.  So, I’m committed to keeping our children safe and giving parents peace of mind that their children aren’t being poisoned where they’re supposed to be educated.","link","http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/06/05/booker-gottheimer-pitch-grant-program-get-lead-out-school-water/370335001/","northjersey.com",126,5,3,5,0,0,0,0

The Export-Import Bank is an example of where local companies can leverage federal resources to expand. It has helped dozens of employers here in the Fifth District, including supporting $827 million in exports alone. By working with the Export-Import Bank, many small businesses can grow, hire more workers and strengthen our local economy.   If you are a business leader here in the Fifth District, please join me for an important roundtable on the Export-Import Bank featuring special guest, former Chairman and President of the Export-Import Bank, Fred Hochberg, on Monday, July 31st at 9am. This event will address best practices for leveraging the Bank’s resources to create new opportunities for your business.  The Export-Import Bank is a critical resource to businesses in the state of New Jersey. The program’s success is highlighted in its 0.26% default rate on loans, $3.9B in funds returned to taxpayers since 2009, and the 1.4M private sector jobs it has supported. In New Jersey, this program has supported, $4,039,300,000 in exports, 25,811 jobs, and 219 companies. This program is a great return on investment for our district, state, and country.   While I’m working to lower taxes, we need to make sure that we’re getting the strongest return on investment on the dollars we send to the federal government. In the Fifth District, we receive 33 cents back for every dollar we send down to Washington D.C, even though we are one of the top three percent taxpaying districts in the country. That’s less than half of New Jersey’s state average, and far less than the $4.23 states like West Virginia receive. Please know I am working in Washington to cut unnecessary, out-of-date regulations and lower taxes to keep companies in New Jersey.   For more details or to RSVP, please contact my Return on Investment Director, Jake Briggs, at Jake.Briggs@mail.house.gov or (201) 389-1100 for all of the details. I look forward to seeing you at this event. Please know my door is always open and I am eager to help your business grow in New Jersey.","status",NA,NA,10,7,0,1,0,0,0,0

We are letting go, and turning our backs, on countless families who have been here decades if not generations because they just can’t afford to stay. That’s unacceptable.  We need to be cutting taxes for seniors, helping them transition into and save for retirement, so they can stay here in New Jersey -- and that’s what my new bipartisan bill does.   My new bipartisan bill, The Senior Housing Improvement and Retirement Accounts (IRA) Act, will help seniors in retirement by reducing the taxes paid from the sale of their home and helping put those dollars into their retirement savings.   Watch my bill announcement live and share if you agree that we need to get the cost of living in New Jersey down:","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoshG/videos/484987375172668/",NA,201,58,27,13,0,1,0,1

Jonathan was born down Route Four in Dumont. And when Jonathan and Marcia met and married – like so many New Jerseyans – they decided to come back to Bergen County to raise their family and live near where they work.  After 26 years, they've grown deep roots in their Glen Rock community, but while the Rieffs moved here for a better quality of life, for good jobs and great public schools, they cannot afford to live here in retirement. And they’re not alone.  New Jersey imposes the second highest state, local income tax burdens on families; we have the second slowest job market in America – only Alaska ranked lower.  And our ROI for all of those dollars has slipped; our roads are eight worst in the nation and our transit system was number one worst on time in the country last year.  While the Rieffs' story represents the best of our state, it also represents the worst part of New Jersey: it’s simply too expensive to live here. In New Jersey, we pay the highest property taxes of any state in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation. Not only that, New Jersey has the highest estate tax in the country.  Like so many New Jerseyans, the Rieffs’ financial advisors told them “look, the only way you get to retire is if you cut expenses.” So, now they are selling their home, despite what they’ll have to pay in capital gains taxes, just so they can afford to live and have enough to retire on.  We should be making it easier for families like the Rieffs to retire. We should be encouraging those who have helped make our communities great to stay here and retire here.  We shouldn’t be slapping seniors with outrageous taxes for trying to downsize their homes, making it even less affordable to live here.  My new bipartisan bill, The Senior Housing Improvement and Retirement Accounts (IRA) Act, will help seniors in retirement by reducing the taxes paid from the sale of their home and helping put those dollars into their retirement savings.  I’m hoping this legislation will be just what John, Marcia, and so many other families just like them need to stay put in the greatest state in the country, spending time with their families, listening to Bruce Springsteen and eating the best pizza in America.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoshG/photos/a.386444985026908.1073741828.385195211818552/485104155160990/?type=3",NA,42,12,1,2,0,0,0,0

The breach at Equifax took place between March and July and was discovered on July 29th, though an announcement to the public did not come for an additional 40 days. The magnitude of the security lapse and the delay between discovery and announcement to consumers and investors are of great concern to me.  This breach will have direct and lingering impacts to New Jersey consumers for years, including identity theft, higher credit costs, and even complete loss of access to credit.  This is unacceptable. To me, it's more Equi-scam than Equi-fix.   Today, from my seat on the Financial Services Committee, I am concerned twofold for New Jersey consumers: 1) that Equifax isn’t doing nearly enough to rectify the problems that they have created for consumers – that they are perhaps being negligent in their customer protection post-breach. And 2): that rather than rushing to rectify their security failure, high-level executives have allegedly engaged in insider trading.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoshG/videos/514935722177833/",NA,68,12,6,0,0,2,0,3

Credit reporting is not usually a very popular topic, but the people of North Jersey are hurting. They are worried that their lives are ruined, that they won’t be able to rent an apartment, get a job, or even get access to government benefits like Social Security and medical care. One letter summed it up pretty concisely when they said “I have worked hard to build my credit and keep my personally identifiable information as secure as possible.” After all of that hard work, Equifax has screwed them.   The frustration is palpable in these letters. Many of them are stuck needing to use the credit-lock opt-out service at a monthly rate for all three credit reporting agencies. To quote another letter, “Hmmmm, let me think about this. It's going to cost me $60 per month ($20 for each agency) to protect the personal data that THEY should be protecting. Surely this is something Congress should be looking at. As a consumer, I don't have a choice but to allow these agencies to have my data. I believe that consumers should be able to opt out at no cost.”   Congress needs to know why the company’s efforts to date have been so inadequate. If it’s due to negligence, then they need to be held accountable. If it’s due to gaps in our laws, then we need to find solutions, because New Jerseyans are hurting.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoshG/videos/515304325474306/",NA,86,10,8,0,0,0,0,0

The President's decision to scrap CSR payments is an irresponsible blow to Jersey families and to health care costs and coverage. This move will singlehandedly both increase the federal deficit by $200 billion and spike premiums by more than 20 percent in New Jersey next year. It will also limit health care options for Americans across the country. After this latest in a series of executive actions meant exclusively to sabotage the ACA, it’s a time for Democrats and Republicans to come together to improve health care.  When the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus proposed fixing the Affordable Care Act in July, we proposed guaranteeing CSR payments for this very reason: it's a common sense policy that will lower premiums by twenty percent, cover more people, cost consumers less, and save the government money. If the Administration wants to play politics by making health care more expensive, then I call on the Speaker to bring a bill to the floor to right this wrong for the American health care marketplace. Dropping CSR payments puts politics in the drivers seat, manufacturing a national emergency rather than pursuing common sense, bipartisan solutions to help New Jersey families.","status",NA,NA,195,68,26,6,2,1,11,30

I want tax cuts and a simpler code for New Jersey families and businesses of all sizes. And I have been on a 'Tax Cut Tour' for months now, outlining New Jersey's priorities for fiscally-responsible tax reform and about what kind of plan I can support. My litmus test has been clear: Will this tax proposal cut taxes for New Jersey families?   As Republicans and Democrats from our state have made clear, this bill fails that test. When all the smoke clears, per capita, it’s actually a tax hike on New Jersey families. Our residents will pay substantially more in federal income taxes.  It will force people and businesses out of our state. I’m hoping the next version will actually get us a tax cut – not a tax hike. I’m ready to support an actual tax cut bill.  This tax hike bill eliminates the state and local tax deduction – a deduction that 52 percent of families in New Jersey take – and severely limits property tax deductions. We will lose our ability to deduct the interest on our home and will see our property values go down.  Seniors and families will lose the ability to deduct their medical expenses. The deficit and national debt will explode, by at least $1.5 trillion.  And other states – moocher states – will, once again, take our tax dollars to pave their roads and build their bridges.  This tax hike bill will make people and businesses think twice about moving to our state, and leave the rest of us with bigger and bigger bills to pay for essential services like police and fire departments, highways, and resources to fight homegrown terror.   Unfortunately, the tax hike bills delivers only one message: Drop Dead, New Jersey.   The American people deserve a bipartisan approach to fix our broken tax code, so I hope the one-sided, backroom bill-writing ends today.  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, I'm ready to hash out our differences -- to sit down at the negotiating table and work out a fair, bipartisan agreement, the way that President Reagan and Tip O'Neil did in 1986. I also look forward to continuing my 'Tax Cut Tour' to bring attention to the New Jersey seniors, families, and businesses that need a true tax cut, not a raw deal.","status",NA,NA,150,36,23,4,1,0,0,11

The plan would retain the same basic rate structure as the Senate bill, including doubling the standard deduction, lowering rates for individuals and reducing the top tax bracket.

I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Fifth District Mayors to do just that. We are paying far too much in federal taxes and the Tax Hike Bill is only going make that worse — eliminating our State and Local Tax deductions, increasing our taxes and lowering our property values. My District pays some of the highest federal taxes in the nation, and historically has only gotten back 33 cents on the dollar for what is sent to Washington. That’s compared to Mississippi which gets $4.38. For the dollars that we already sent to Washington, we need to claw back as much as possible and boost our return on our investment by fighting for federal grants. We've already seen record successes this year to support our cops, firefighters, and towns. I'm leaving no stone unturned and hope that by sharing these best practices, our mayors can build on this success and save more money for their towns and taxpayers.
