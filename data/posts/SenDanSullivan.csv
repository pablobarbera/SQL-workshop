The terrorists were gravely mistaken about the resolve and character of the American people. What emerged that day was a bravery and compassion that for centuries has defined the American spirit: first responders racing into burning buildings, everyday Americans sacrificing their lives to protect their neighbors and prevent further mayhem, and the brave men and women who have brought the fight to the enemy and kept the homeland safe. On Patriot Day, let us all vow to remember those who sacrificed to keep us safe, pray for those they left behind, and rekindle the unity that we experienced on that grave day in September.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenDanSullivan/videos/10155610231219360/",NA,143,14,23,15,0,0,20,1

With time to review and analyze the actual order, we have greater clarity and I am heartened to see that the order itself does not reflect some of the misguided rhetoric used during the campaign. As I noted during that time – while we must aggressively fight against radical Islam, we cannot sacrifice our country's founding principles.  The public should know that those immigrants who hold a green card and are lawful permanent residents are not affected. The public should also know that this order does not target those who practice a specific religion.  Rather, it is about temporarily suspending visitors and those seeking refugee status to the United States predominantly from countries that the former Obama administration and now Trump administration deem a security risk to our country. The temporary restrictions, which I support, will be in place until our vetting and screening system is thoroughly reexamined to ensure terrorists aren’t entering our country. Witnesses testified before the Homeland Security Committees last Congress that screening procedures needed to be reviewed.  As we move forward, I would hope that the Trump Administration better communicates the facts to agency officials, Congress, the American people, and our allies abroad. It is important to remember that some of our most critical allies in the war on terrorism are majority Muslim countries. Additionally, it’s important that those foreign nationals who have served with our U.S. military abroad – in countries like Iraq – be given special consideration when examining their immigration and refugee eligibility.   I would also hope that Senate Democrats cease their unprecedented obstruction of cabinet officials, so that agencies can be fully staffed and prepared for such orders.

First and foremost, it’s important to remember that Congress holds the power of the purse, and will ultimately fund the federal government. This budget request from the White House is a first step and a general blueprint for where our country should be headed: Increased funding for our national defense and homeland security, and cuts to agencies that have stifled economic growth over the last eight years. However, some of the specific cuts in this budget disproportionately target rural economies across our country, including in Alaska, and some don’t align with the commitments made by members of the Trump administration during their confirmation process and hearings.   Going forward, I’ll be working closely with Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young to fight for programs and funding specifically designed to help Alaska grow its economy and to build infrastructure projects that align with acceptable modern standards.","status",NA,NA,63,54,6,0,1,0,0,0

From my initial review, I see some positive elements in the budget request, such as opening the non-wilderness 1002 area for responsible resource development, and a continued increase in funding for combatting our nation’s opioid and heroin epidemic – something that I’ve strongly advocated for.  With regard to defense spending, while the President’s budget proposal is an improvement and an increase over the severely-depressed Obama-era defense budgets, and includes $170 million of military construction for Alaska, I remain concerned that – in an increasingly dangerous world – this budget proposal does not provide enough resources to really begin rebuilding our military.   I am strongly opposed to specific reductions in this budget that disproportionately target rural economies across our country, including in Alaska – cutting funds for Essential Air Service, water and wastewater infrastructure, low-income heating assistance, and critical education programs.

The Graham-Cassidy Senate healthcare reform proposal would have sent federal healthcare dollars and decision-making back to the states—the laboratories of democracy—to decide how best to meet the needs of their constituents. As Alaskans know, our healthcare challenges are different from other states, and the top-down mandates, which are the foundation of the Affordable Care Act, simply haven’t worked for thousands of Alaskans.  The Graham-Cassidy bill, which I’m convinced would have brought more funds and more flexibility to Alaska, was compelling. Unfortunately, the process was rushed and we ran out of time to fully vet the data. I appreciate the collaborative work that the State of Alaska’s healthcare team put into this, and all of the hard work that Senators Graham and Cassidy undertook to understand and act on our issues. As a result of the delegation’s relentless work to educate our colleagues on Alaska’s challenges, I thoroughly expect that when this bill is reintroduced and reviewed, Alaska’s unique healthcare landscape will again be recognized, as it was in Graham-Cassidy.  Finally, it’s imperative that we continue to work toward a better healthcare system for Alaskans and all Americans. The Affordable Care Act has not worked as promised and continues to collapse across the country. We are now at a crossroads. One-third of my Democratic colleagues have signed onto a bill, introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, which would force an estimated 155 million Americans off of their private insurance plans and into a healthcare system controlled and run by the federal government that would cost tens of trillions of dollars. The Graham-Cassidy bill would have brought significant federal resources to states, recognizing all of our unique healthcare challenges, and would have brought the decision-making closer to the people.","status",NA,NA,249,463,32,6,57,10,21,123

It’s been nearly 10 months since inauguration and many critical roles – department heads and senior administration posts - remain vacant. One of those people, still stuck in this partisan logjam, is Alaska’s own Joe Balash – our former Department of Natural Resources Commissioner and nominee to serve as the next U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Lands and Minerals, who has been waiting over 110 days to be confirmed.  Over the last 10 days, I’ve worked with Democratic leadership to get his confirmation moving, and while they agreed to clear him, it now appears two Senate Democrats have placed “secret holds” on him. Regardless of political affiliation or belief, we should all agree that our agencies need qualified people to run them. This is no way to operate.  #FreeJoe","status",NA,NA,107,59,8,1,14,2,5,22
