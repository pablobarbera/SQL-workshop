In a separate pan, take fennel bulbs cut into several pieces, red bell peppers, shallots, carrots, potatoes, and lemons cut in half. Mix with a few teaspoons of olive oil, season with salt and pepper.  Bake at 360 for 50 minutes to an hour. If you want, you can broil the chicken for an additional 3 minutes.

This bill throws 24 million Americans off their health insurance, cuts Medicaid by $880 billion, and gives a huge tax cut to the richest people in our country. It cuts Medicare, it does away with essential health benefits like maternity care, and it also, I’m sad to say, takes away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. It is an outrage, an abomination, and we need to stop it.  The #resistance needs to continue. We need to now look at the United States Senate. Our two senators, Senator Edward J. Markey and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren are on the right side of this issue and they’re going to be fighting.   Healthcare ought to be a right in this country, not a privilege. We cannot allow this terrible excuse of a healthcare bill to become law. I’m going to stand with you and fight it every step of the way. We need to stop this.

Today I joined House Democrats on a “discharge petition” to force House Republicans to bring up a bill that will set up an independent commission to investigate #TrumpRussia ties, including the President’s possible obstruction of justice of the FBI investigation.     For that petition to work, it needs 218 Members of the House to sign it. That means some Republicans will need to show some courage and do what’s right for the country, not just their political party.  If the discharge petition is successful, it would bring H.R. 356 before the House. As an original cosponsor of this bill, I am proud to say it currently has 200 cosponsors.  While any Member can file articles of impeachment, we must stay focused and #FollowTheFacts through a thorough and fully independent investigation. Only when we have all the facts can we determine whether there is a case to be made for the House Judiciary Committee to begin impeachment proceedings.    It will take real courage House Republicans to finally speak up and join the growing chorus of Americans demanding that President Trump be held accountable.

If you worked hard and played by the rules, you could own a home, afford a car, put your kids through college, get a pension, or at least put enough away for a comfortable retirement. But things have changed.  Today’s working Americans and young people joining the workforce are frustrated. They’re worried about the future and scared that the dream of a good middle class life is slipping out of reach. And they have every right to be.  That's why Democrats are proposing a new agenda: A Better Deal for the American People.

Their trillion-and-a-half dollar giveaway to corporate America should have gone to fixing our roads and schools, or lowering the cost of healthcare, or making college more affordable. But instead of fighting for the people that sent them to Congress, they once again made it clear they’d rather stand with their wealthy friends and corporate sponsors than with the American people.

The #GOPTaxScam passed today will line their pockets and the pockets of their donors – giving the vast majority of tax breaks to those at the top and corporations shipping American jobs overseas, all the while exploding the deficit and raising taxes on hardworking Massachusetts families. 86% of the tax cuts contained in this bill go to the wealthiest 1%  Even worse, Speaker Paul Ryan jammed this tax bill through the House with zero hearings, zero input from Democrats, and almost no time for anyone to review the bill before we voted on it.  The American people will remember this as the moment that their economic future was auctioned off to the highest bidder.
