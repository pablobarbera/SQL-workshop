The reality is, terrorism inspired by radicalism and hate is global in scope and, as such, requires a comprehensive response, not a purely regional focus. While serious actions are needed to protect our country, these must not be done in a way that singles out any specific nations or ethnicities.

Today, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and I released the findings of thislong-awaited report.  While it won’t do anything to help women battling cancer who have had their lives devastated by power morcellators, or provide much comfort to the families of those already lost, it does, however, shed light on the broken system that allowed this devastation to happen and include a roadmap to address it. The GAO report confirms what we had long expected: there are serious gaps in the FDA’s device reporting system and that immediate Congressional action is needed to reform the process and save lives. Additionally, given the associated risks, it's clear that this device is no longer appropriate in the treatment of uterine fibroids.

The United States must stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our European allies and with the Ukrainian people, who have demonstrated time and again their will for a sovereign and democratic country, free from Russia's interference.

The Affordable Care Act is broken in many areas and desperately needs to be fixed or replaced with a system that works better for everyone. Premiums continue to skyrocket, deductibles are soaring, and insurers are opting out of exchanges. Moreover, competition is increasingly limited in the insurance markets; one-third of the counties in the United States have access to only one insurance provider, and five states have only one provider. Last year, premiums in Pennsylvania rose on average by roughly 33 percent.  This trajectory is unsustainable.  If we accept the status quo, our healthcare system will collapse and all of us will suffer as a result.  We urgently need a patient-centered, integrated healthcare model that provides individuals the freedom of choice, physicians the freedom to practice, and those with chronic disease, addiction or illness the freedom to live their lives knowing they have access to quality, affordable healthcare.   I have spent countless hours in these first two months analyzing this problem, listening to and meeting with constituents of all viewpoints, speaking with local officials, and learning the stories of patients, physicians, industry professionals, and representatives of almost every stakeholder engaged in healthcare reform.  After considering the current healthcare bill in a thorough and deliberate manner, I have concluded that, although the American Health Care Act focuses on several much-needed reforms to our healthcare system, in its current form I cannot support this legislation.  I have many concerns with this bill, and first among them is the impact on the single most important issue plaguing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, and the issue that I have made my priority in Congress:  opioid abuse prevention, treatment and recovery.    I commend both the Administration and House Leadership for focusing our nation's attention on reforming our broken healthcare model.  I am continuing my discussions with House leadership, urging them to address our concerns and to develop solutions based upon transparency and free-market principles to drive down healthcare costs and expand access to all.  It is important to note that this bill is one of several reform measures being considered, and many more bills will surely follow.  It is incumbent upon all elected officials, at every level of government, to take our time and to get this right.  Healthcare is far too important and we must not settle for anything less.    As we continue working to reform and improve our healthcare system, please continue to let your voices be heard.  I am listening intently and want all district residents to be involved in this process.  At every turn, we must listen to each other, respect each other, and put our country first—always.  No exceptions.  Share your thoughts here: http://fitzpatrick.house.gov/contact-me","status",NA,NA,778,585,191,64,1,2,1,12

We have the opportunity to make needed reforms to lower costs and increase access to health care – let’s take the time, and do the work, to get it right. That means addressing several concerns including services for opioid addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery.”   Fitzpatrick announced earlier this week he would not support the bill.  Earlier this year, Fitzpatrick launched a Health Care Listening Tour comprising of sit-down meetings and listening sessions with patients, physicians, industry professionals, and local stakeholders on health care reform. He continues to actively solicit constituent input regarding the future of healthcare. His deliberate approach seeks to compare current policy with new proposals that advance the progress of healthcare in America.   As member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, Fitzpatrick testified earlier this month before a House Appropriations subcommittee to urge for robust funding authorized by CARA and the 21st Century Cures Act to help communities combat the opioid epidemic. Additionally, he has advocated for increased access to healthcare and medical treatments, including speaking out in support of removing barriers to care for the terminally ill Americans. Fitzpatrick has also called for the doubling women’s health funding at the National Institutes of Health from $4 billion to $8 billion.

The Affordable Care Act has failed to live up to its promises, and too many are left with skyrocketing premiums, limited access to their doctors, and insurers pulling out of the system entirely. This broken process yielded a broken product – the very reason we’re dealing with this situation today.  I’ve said from the start: ‘We need to proceed in fixing our healthcare system in a responsible, deliberate manner. That means any changes to our current system must ensure both the continuity of coverage and the continuity of patient protection provisions.’ Throughout this debate, I’ve made clear my concerns about the proposed legislation - including its impact on our response to the opioid epidemic crushing our community, something I’ve made a primary focus in Congress. Despite some positive portions, I could not support this bill with these issues unresolved.   It is my hope that the Senate takes the opportunity to return a reform bill that addresses this bill’s shortfalls, provides real solutions for the American people, and can garner my support because the status quo is unacceptable.”  ---  Earlier this year, Fitzpatrick launched a Health Care Listening Tour comprising of sit-down meetings and listening sessions with patients, physicians, industry professionals, and local stakeholders on health care reform. He continues to actively solicit constituent input regarding the future of healthcare. His deliberate approach seeks to compare current policy with new proposals that advance the progress of healthcare in America.   As member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, Fitzpatrick has testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee to urge for robust funding authorized by CARA and the 21st Century Cures Act to help communities combat the opioid epidemic. Additionally, he has advocated for increased access to healthcare and medical treatments, including speaking out in support of removing barriers to care for the terminally ill Americans. Fitzpatrick has also called for the doubling women’s health funding at the National Institutes of Health from $4 billion to $8 billion.  ###  Online: http://bit.ly/2pDDtNF","status",NA,NA,679,682,90,60,0,3,7,15

Born in Ireland on October 1, 1898, he worked in Ireland as a blacksmith and he never lost sight of his dream. In April of 1923, his dream became reality when he arrived in America through Ellis Island with the little money he was able to save working as a blacksmith. He continued that trade in New York City, just trying to make his way, while also worked various construction jobs on New York City office buildings. In whatever little free time he had, he loved to play the Violin in a number of Irish Dance Halls throughout Manhattan.    He truly represents the American Dream that we all must never take for granted. A dream that we can continue if we commit to working together, listening to each other & respecting each other as human beings... as Americans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBrianFitzpatrick/videos/1936444593287878/",NA,144,49,11,9,0,0,3,0

Post 697 is honoring the life & memory of Bernie Lens.  In 1939, Bernie enlisted in the Army to fight the war in Europe. During his time there, serving in Patton’s Third Army, he helped to liberate Dachau concentration camp. After the war he returned home, and went about his life, rarely talking about what he has seen, until one day, he started talking.   He was known in our community for his talks with students, in schools and community centers, working to ensure the horrors of what he saw at Dachau were not forgotten and would never happen again. People gravitated toward him due to his quick wit and warm demeanor.   He worked closely with the Holocaust Remembrance Program of Post 697 of the Jewish War Veterans in Levittown, which continues his work today. Bernie found incredible purpose from a dark experience in his life, a lesson we can all benefit from.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBrianFitzpatrick/videos/1941012539497750/",NA,54,21,6,3,0,0,2,0

But tax reform isn’t about percentage points or pie charts — it’s about people.  It’s about farmers in Franconia who wants their family farm to be successful and operational when their children are grown. It’s about moms in Middletown who are trying to make ends meet while saving for life’s special moments. And it’s about the small business owners in Sellersville who want to continue to serve their community and support their employees but are restricted by red tape and compliance costs.  Tax reform has many faces — more than 700,000 of them right in our district — and every single one of them should inspire Washington’s work on pro-growth tax reform. It’s with these people in mind that I joined the House today in passing tax reform legislation that cuts rates, improves simplicity and levels the playing field for the hardworking taxpayers of Bucks and Montgomery counties.

Now, a decade later to the day, I will be back in the region to spend Christmas with our troops in Afghanistan - ground zero in the global fight against terrorism.   As families across our district enjoy another holiday season safe at home, it is often easy to forget that there are thousands of women and men serving our country in battlefields and barracks across the globe. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brave service-members who stand ready to protect our freedom, even when it means being deployed overseas during this special season.   This trip provides the opportunity to not only say ‘thank you’ to these heroes, but to speak directly with our troops, military generals and governmental and diplomatic officials about the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and throughout the region. As we enter a new phase in the War on Terror, it is crucial that Congress continue to work with our military and civilian partners to keep our homeland safe and to defeat the threat of terrorism; this mission will play an important part in shaping this strategy.","link","https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/breaking-fitzpatrick-spend-christmas-day-us-troops-afghanistan","fitzpatrick.house.gov",214,82,16,20,0,5,0,1

The United States of America, unequivocally, has the most noble and honorable fighting force on the planet, a fact I was reminded of once again today being along side of these amazing men and women who were away from their families on Christmas in order to serve us and the country they love.
