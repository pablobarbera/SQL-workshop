The Clean Power Plan which seeks to reduce carbon pollution from fossil-fueled power plants by more than 30 percent, was the biggest action the United States had ever taken to reduce carbon pollution, the main source driving climate change. It was also the lynchpin of the Paris Climate Agreement which brought countries from all over the world together for the first time to combat climate change.  By weakening the Clean Power Plan and retreating as the world’s leader in combating climate change, the Trump Administration is giving away the ever-growing clean energy economy to China. Contrary to President Trump’s assertions, these actions will not bring back coal-mining jobs in Appalachia as natural gas continues to be more economically competitive than coal, the main reason for coal’s demise. The climate gap, the sometimes hidden and often-unequal impact of climate change on people of color and the poor, is real and only getting worse. Climate change disproportionately impacts minority and low-income communities like those in my district, especially with respect to heat waves, air quality and extreme weather events. Low-income and minority communities in the inner city are more susceptible to the “heat island” effect where temperatures are magnified by concrete and asphalt.  Reports have shown that African Americans living in Los Angeles are twice as likely to die as other Angelenos during a heat wave. One of my top priorities is the issue of environmental justice - people should not breathe dirtier air simply because of their income or what they look like. As a United States Congresswoman for California’s 44th congressional district, I will do everything I can to ensure clean air, water and lands for vulnerable populations.","status",NA,NA,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The firing of Comey, on top of other officials who were investigating the wrongdoings of the Trump Administration, looks like President Nixon’s ""Saturday Night Massacre.""  It is simply stunning and troubling that when an employee does not agree with the President, they are suddenly fired.    This abrupt action only raises more red flags into the actions of the administration and leads to further speculation of a cover up.  This does not seem to be a coincidence.  As I have done for months, I continue the call for the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel – someone as far away from the White House as possible – to properly investigate the probe into the 2016 election and any other connection these Trump officials have to Russia.  Additionally, I echo the call for Congress to hold immediate emergency hearings to obtain testimony directly from Attorney General Sessions, the deputy attorney general, and FBI Director Comey.","link","https://barragan.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-barrag-n-statement-trump-s-firing-fbi-director-comey","barragan.house.gov",67,3,9,3,0,0,0,0

Nanette Diaz Barragán to Promote Urban Greenspaces   SAN PEDRO, Calif.—On Monday July 10, at 10 a.m., Congresswoman Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-San Pedro) will outline her new bill to promote funding for urban parks. The Congresswoman will discuss some of the potential projects that will be eligible for funding.  The most livable cities are dotted by greenspaces. That’s why Rep. Barragán has introduced legislation in Congress to create a dedicated source of funding for urban projects that expand outdoor recreational opportunities, particularly in underserved areas.   The Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program Act of 2017 (H.R. 2943) would codify a federal grants program that offers matching funds to state and local governments investing in much-needed outdoor outlets for city residents. It has bipartisan support.  Who: Rep.
