The news story focuses on alleged civil rights complaints against Sessions, and 90% of the story focuses on Democrat Senator Cory Booker and Democrat Congressman John Lewis who are both opposed to Sessions confirmation.   What NBC doesn’t show its viewers is the strong, unwavering support coming from 3 prominent black witnesses – who support and have worked alongside Sessions for decades. Unlike the opposing witnesses, these men have personal relationships with Sessions. They’ve been to his house and had dinner with his family. If this story focuses on civil rights and the freedoms of black men in this country, then why would they cut out these specific black men who support Senator Sessions? Why would they cut out the men who have worked with Senator Sessions for years – the men who testify in support of Jeff Sessions’ moral integrity? Could it be because their viewpoints do not follow the status quo of the leftist agenda?   I don’t have a problem with the media reporting on stories when its viewers know that the stories are politically biased. But I do have a problem with our national broadcast networks who claim to fairly report these biased stories with the hopes that the American public isn’t smart enough to know better. They need to be held to a higher standard. #MediaBias   Click here to see the full story and listen to the viewpoints from both sides of the debate on Sessions confirmation in the Senate:  https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4645257","link","http://www.today.com/video/sen-cory-booker-testifies-against-jeff-sessions-trump-s-pick-for-attorney-general-853271107817","today.com",117,37,29,8,2,1,0,15

More than 15,000 oil and gas companies no longer have to report technical information regarding methane emissions.   This quick action at the EPA under U.S. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is welcomed news to those of us seeking an EPA that respects states’ rights and focuses on the authorities Congress has granted them. This onerous information request targeting the oil and gas industry would have brought little to no value for the environment or the EPA. Quite frankly, the EPA should defer to or work with the state regulatory agencies who already have much of this information – as they work day in and day out with industry to ensure we have clean air and clean water. I commend the Administration on this action and look forward to continuing to re-balance our branches of government and easing its regulatory burden.

States have all the tools necessary to responsibly regulate coal, oil and natural gas development. From the beginning, these rules were meant as an attack on the North Dakota economy, and has had punishing consequences on jobs in Western North Dakota.","link","http://bit.ly/2mPRY11","bit.ly",57,11,9,7,1,0,1,5

""During the Obama administration, the FTC concluded that “any privacy framework should be technology neutral” because “ISPs are just one type of large platform provider” and “operating systems and browsers may be in a position to track all, or virtually all, of a consumer’s online activity to create highly detailed profiles.” But the FCC didn’t follow this guidance. Instead, it adopted rules that would have created a fractured privacy framework under which ISPs would have been subject to one standard and content providers would have been subject to another. The Obama FTC, in a unanimous bipartisan comment, criticized this approach as “not optimal.” In Washington-speak, that’s a major rebuke.""","link","http://wapo.st/2nV0gSD?tid=ss_fb","apo.st",37,14,13,1,4,0,2,1

Due to lack of population and costly infrastructure, many areas of our country simply cannot sustain private internet service providers, which is why the Universal Service Fund is, in many cases, essential for our rural telecom providers.   Without it, and without high-speed internet, the small-town life we value in North Dakota would continue to diminish as families and businesses move to larger towns out of necessity for high-speed broadband.   We can’t let that happen, and my letter signed by 102 bipartisan House members demonstrates the vast support Congress maintains for those living in rural America.

The Order declares that it is the policy of the Administration to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty. It directs the Internal Revenue Service to exercise as much discretion as possible to alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment, a provision that prohibits religious leaders from speaking about politics and candidates from the pulpit. In addition, the Order will provide regulatory relief for religious objectors to Obamacare’s provide preventative services mandate, which was supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in its Hobby Lobby case.  For millions of Americans, the church is the foundation on which we build our moral and spiritual values. The idea that we can somehow separate those values from the rest of our beliefs – including political beliefs – goes against the very principles our country was founded on. It’s clear our President shares that same sentiment with the religious freedom executive order he signed today. I applaud President Trump for taking these necessary actions, and support his administrative policy to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty.

As consequence, the Kim Regime continues to expand its nuclear weapons program while at the same time testing missiles on more than 49 occasions since the beginning of 2015. It’s time to start dealing with North Korea from a position of strength.

A family of four on Obamacare in North Dakota with the state‘s median household income of $60,000 may have to pay between $12,000 and $15,000 out-of-pocket before their health insurance even kicks in – a whopping 25 percent of their entire income.   Unfortunately, matters are getting worse as the downward spiral of Obamacare continues. With premiums skyrocketing in 2018, one-third of counties having only one insurance plan, and many counties having no options at all, it is imperative we act to prevent a total collapse of the American health care system.   This is a rescue mission, and North Dakotans have a right to better health care. I encourage the Senate to pass a bill as soon as practical so we can reconcile any differences and rescue the American people.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinCramer/photos/a.498845246805030.112544.498751820147706/1462555207100691/?type=3",NA,97,76,53,1,1,15,3,25

To address this, the House passed the Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act today, which encourages employer-led partnerships with state and local agencies to hire recipients from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, providing recipients with highly-valued work experience and on-the-job training, including apprenticeships.

Apolinar Altamirano, Ronnebeck’s killer, was out of jail on bond when he walked into a QT convenience store where Ronnebeck worked. Altamirano threw change on the counter, and immediately demanded a pack of cigarettes. When Ronnebeck was counting the change, Altamirano pulled out a gun and said, “You’re not going to give me my cigarettes.” Ronnebeck offered over the pack of cigarettes, but Altamirano shot Ronnebeck, killing him instantly.   Only days before, Altamirano was removed and cited for trespassing at the very same QT store. Altamirano was also arrested twice prior to this tragedy. At the time of Ronnebeck’s murder, Altamirano was out on bond while ICE was still deciding whether or not he should be deported.   Later this afternoon, the House will pass H.R. 3003 that contains  Grant’s Law, which ensures unlawful immigrants convicted or arrested for dangerous crimes are detained during their removal proceedings.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinCramer/photos/a.498845246805030.112544.498751820147706/1471236279565917/?type=3",NA,111,37,21,2,1,1,31,26

You've done a beautiful job with this piece, Michaela! Thanks for coming out to our nation's capital to see it put on display.       Michaela recently graduated from Central High School, and she will be attending art school in Halifax Nova Scotia at NSCAD University in the fall.   Her winning piece, “Badlands” is an acrylic depiction of North Dakota’s vast terrains, and will hang in the halls of the U.S. Capitol over the next year where hundreds of thousands of visitors will pass and admire it daily.           I'm proud knowing that Michaela's art piece of the Badlands will be the depiction of North Dakota seen by so many people over the next year. North Dakota is a beautiful place and its beauty isn't always easy to capture because it’s so immense and so vast.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinCramer/videos/1472172499472295/",NA,103,21,25,24,1,3,0,0

Actions speak louder than words. Due to President Trump’s commitment to renewing border security, apprehensions are down 46% in the short time since he took office. Indeed, we are a nation of immigrants, but unlike our previous commander and chief, President Trump is setting the record straight that all immigrants must come here legally – the way our ancestors did. But, the President can’t do this alone.

It’s up to the Senate now to act and fulfill our promise to the American people.","status",NA,NA,403,98,28,28,19,1,3,38

We recorded the entire meeting to create a record of grievances. I was hoping to get some responses from the Service, but the representatives mainly listened. It is my intent to use this video and other testimony and evidence to draft legislation, work with the Department of Interior on rules and guidance, and if necessary, to assist in possible class action in the court system.   While the representatives from U.S. F&W Service said very little, it is obvious by some of their comments and reactions, that the agency has used inappropriate tactics and largely ignored the clear language of the law and previous cases in overreaching their authority.

The National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017 creates a privately funded pilot program to conduct limited and selective vegetation management near utility infrastructure outside of a right-of-way.   A reliable supply of electricity is important on many levels, from human health and safety to commercial productivity. Yet, deep within forests managed by federal agencies the risk for outages has been elevated with declining forest health and increased forest fires. Utility companies want to keep the electrons flowing, but a high liability standard keeps them from vegetation management beyond their right-of-way. My bill creates a pilot program completely funded by participating utility companies under a reduced liability standard near their right-of-way so companies will go in to reduce potential hazards to disrupt reliable service.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinCramer/videos/1586904991332378/",NA,50,8,4,0,0,0,0,0
