The Senate bill released today will leave millions without access to health care coverage and with increased out-of-pocket and premium costs – instead handing out large tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. This legislation callously allows insurance companies to discriminate against those with preexisting conditions, inevitably pricing many out of the insurance market. Covering essential health benefits is no longer required, including maternity coverage and prescription drugs. It cuts over $75 billion cut from the Medicare trust fund, shortening the life of this critical program, and deeply slashes Medicaid funding.

The remarkable impact of the ACA has been felt throughout the country, but especially in our state. In California alone, 4.29 million people would lose their health insurance under the Republican plan. This bill will negatively impact some of the most vulnerable Californians – increasing the rate of uninsured children by cutting Medicaid funding, charging people over 55 much higher premiums, and allowing insurers to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions.  The ACA meant more people than ever before had access to insurance coverage, but there are still improvements to be made. Rather than repeal, we need to work together to achieve bi-partisan reform. Ideas like Permanent Reinsurance Programs would protect people with pre-existing conditions, while still keeping market prices low. Maintaining protections from the ACA while working toward creating more affordable healthcare options are essential to stabilizing the individual market and ensuring better coverage for more people, not less.   We cannot afford to give up the progress we’ve made to provide quality insurance to millions of Americans.

Those affected will need to find a new insurance plan during the open enrollment period beginning this November. If anyone has issues during the enrollment period, please contact my office.   President Trump’s continued threats to “let Obamacare fail” by not making Cost Reduction Sharing (CRS) payments that keep insurance premiums down and not enforcing the individual mandate, have frustratingly helped destabilize our insurance markets. Insecurity among insurance companies lead to higher premiums, on the Central Coast specifically, rates are expected to go up by 6%.   Now, more than ever, Congress must to work across the aisle to improve healthcare system and bring down costs for all Americans. That is why I have joined with a bipartisan group of my colleagues in the ‘Problem Solvers Caucus’ to craft smart, bipartisan legislation that would stabilize the insurance markets and also keep out-of-pocket payments down. These proposals include mandatory funding for CRS payments and creating a permanent reinsurance program, which ended last year. I am also the proud co-sponsor of H.R. 1307, to create a public option under the ACA and provide much needed competition between private industry to bring down healthcare insurance costs.
