Over the last couple of months, it’s become more apparent that foreign actors undermined our election process.  U.S. intelligence agencies - from the CIA to the FBI - have found that the Russian government directly interfered in the election, and members of Congress in both political parties agree that an investigation is necessary.  Most importantly, I support this bill because the American people deserve a complete accounting of what happened this election cycle and how we can prevent attacks like this from occurring in the future.  Our democracy depends on the people’s faith in it.  We all have the right to know about foreign attempts to obstruct our elections, and this commission would evaluate any interference in an independent, nonpartisan manner.  It’s time to get answers.

This one I needed to share with all of you.   Dear Rep. Polis,  I participated in your town hall meeting by phone Sunday, and I am following up with a personal story regarding my daughter and me, as it relates to the possible loss of the Affordable Care Act. I have been on the Affordable Care Act – better known as Obamacare – since close to its inception.  One year after my fifth and last surgery for breast cancer (my mother is a survivor as well), Grace, my youngest child and beautiful daughter was inconceivably diagnosed with ALL Children's Leukemia. Grace was eight-and-a-half and in third grade, here in Boulder.  As a beautiful girl with a contagious laugh and personality, Grace was pursued and eventually signed with a talent agency that spotted her. So, we were in California, meeting and having photos done during spring break, and Grace was asked to read for Alice in Wonderland (the movie)! After this amazing opportunity, as we flew home, Grace became ill.  Two days later, our family doctor suspected the worst, ran tests, and sent us home to pack before going to check in at Children's Hospital. Our lives changed overnight, as the unimaginable ""journey,"" as it's called, began. My husband was at a loss, wringing his hands and crying. I put my work on the back-burner and became a full-time advocate for my daughter's survival. Grace endured 26 months of extensive ""treatment;” one year of which included up to 3-4 intensive chemo therapy sessions per week. We called me the “shock absorber”, doing whatever was necessary for Grace’s survival and to make it tolerable for her. Following the first year of intensive treatment, we were given a gift of some family counseling, and were actually diagnosed with PTSD, as a family; myself in particular.  Without health insurance, we could not - would not have survived. We will be forever grateful to our family, friends, community, and wonderful school, who rallied at our side, but the cost of giving up my work and the supplemental expenses involved in treatment of a life-threatening disease are a struggle alone; we never could have sustained 26 needed months of treatment, economically. There is no doubt it would have necessitated bankruptcy, and possibly the inability to complete treatment. In addition, there is subsequent treatment.   Child cancer survivors are ""followed for life"" in a different division of Children's (the ""Hope Clinic""), with follow-up labs, scans and check-ups, as the after-effects of certain intensive chemos can range from weakened heart muscles, infertility, endocrine-related issues and many more; let alone the learning disabilities that the after-effects of chemo typically bring. I must say that we continue to struggle, as it is, to get our family back on its feet. The thought of trying to imagine doing that ""journey"" without the assistance of healthcare--in other words, without the support of our U.S. government is unimaginable. And looking at it that way, it would instill a sense that our country, our government does not care about us--the taxpayers. Again, unimaginable. It brings the tears back to my own eyes.  Thank you for your support, for caring about your constituents, Jared, and for your tireless work. Our community has great appreciation of you!  Best Regards,  Marcia","photo","https://www.facebook.com/jaredpolis/photos/a.130848302529.105829.53481427529/10154708748582530/?type=3",NA,184,29,30,39,0,0,12,1

Trump,  Today, I wanted to write briefly on a topic that has been extraordinarily troubling to my community. That is your administration’s war on science.  I’m proud to represent a district that is home to world-renowned research and science facilities. Our federal laboratories and institutions are sources of ingenuity and generate advancements ranging from lifesaving devices to renewable energy tech to weather prediction tools. They provide good-paying professional jobs that do important work in the public interest, and help our community attract and retain a highly educated workforce, which in-turn fuels further innovation.  Since I’ve been in office, there has never been a time until now when hundreds of acclaimed scientists, researchers, and analysts have called my office worried about losing funding for research projects and scientific programs. I believe when some of the brightest minds in the world call my office, at the bare minimum, we should listen, and more likely than not, we should act.  Mr. President, we’re at a critical time; at this moment, some of the most intelligent thinkers on our planet are extraordinarily concerned about the direction that we’re heading with regard to our nation’s acceptance of science, and also worried that decades of progress are about to come to a halt because of your administration’s inability to accept scientific facts, theories, and publications.  Mr. President, your administration must accept science and the validity of the scientific process, or it will take our country and world into a tailspin economically. You must accept the fact that dismantling our federal laboratories, crippling science budgets, and placing a gag order on scientific agencies harms our nation’s growth and prosperity.   I strongly urge you to support and fully fund our federal research laboratories and research grants to our Universities. America must continue to be a model on the global platform for innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders in the scientific community. For America to be great, we need to continue to be the global leader in science.  Mr. President, please understand that the scientific community is not only beneficial to the American economy, but also vital for the betterment of humankind.  Writing this to you in 2017,  Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.)  Proudly representing the Second Congressional District of Colorado and several outstanding scientific and research institutions including: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) , National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and high quality research institutions University of Colorado Boulder, and Colorado State University.","status",NA,NA,2090,184,541,355,2,9,0,2

Our nation needs to say clearly once again that using drugs will destroy your life.”  Wow. Every responsible adult, medical expert, and scientist knows that the dangers of heroin far outweigh the effects of responsible marijuana use.   Medical marijuana, which is far less addictive and harmful than opioids, can play a significant role in reducing the current epidemic of opioid addiction and deaths. 2014 data from the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that medical cannabis laws are associated with significantly lower (24.8%) state-level opioid overdose mortality rates. In cases where marijuana works for chronic pain management, it should be a preferred option over opioids.  Colorado is living proof that allowing responsible adults to use marijuana if they choose gives money to classrooms instead of cartels, creates jobs instead of addicts, and boosts our economy instead of our prison population.

The Foreign Emoluments Clause prohibits any officer of the U.S. from accepting anything of value from any foreign government or its agents or instrumentalities without prior Congressional consent. This means that it is unconstitutional for a President to receive financial benefits from foreign countries while serving our nation.  President Trump has failed to separate himself from his business holdings in any meaningful way.  Since taking office, he has continued to receive payments and other benefits from many foreign governments -all without Congressional consent. Whether it’s payments for rooms and events at the Trump Hotel in Washington from the Embassy of Kuwait, the government of Georgia, and a lobbying firm working for Saudi Arabia; lease payments for space in Trump Tower paid by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the United Arab Emirates; or the countless other business and property interests abroad which we might not even know about.

We need a strong labor movement to address the growing income disparities in our country.  The Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act has six main parts: (1) empowering shareholders to hold executives accountable by allowing them to have a say in CEO compensation, (2) preventing labor busting by making sure no tax dollars go to avoiding unions, (3) removing barriers to collective bargaining agreements by giving employers a stricter timeline to negotiate with the union, (4) enhancing criminal penalties for labor violations like withholding overtime, (5) ensuring that employees are classified correctly, and (6) increasing employer transparency by requiring thorough pay stubs.

This 1% cut would have amounted to approximately $6.2 billion dollars and would have been an effective way to address our ever-expanding military budget.  Last year, the United States spent over $610 BILLION dollars on the military, more than China, Russia, and the next five largest military budgets around the world combined, and that is set to increase this year.  We simply cannot sustain this level of spending and then turn around and say we are also concerned about the national debt, which in and of itself is a threat to national security. It is possible to continue to keep Americans safe and secure from outside threats without spending billions of dollars beyond what has been requested by the military.

Fortunately,  it was narrowly defeated with a few Republicans breaking ranks. The defeat of the “skinny repeal” was a testament to you.    It was a testament to the perseverance of Grace, an eight-year old from Boulder who was diagnosed with ALL Children's Leukemia, and the entire Kohler family who under the ACA exchange could afford health insurance to do whatever was necessary for Grace’s survival.   It was a testament to Jacki from Loveland, who after decades of running developed a heart condition, and relies on a pacemaker. She credits the ability to afford her own health insurance to the ACA.  It was a testament to the thousands of you who have sent letters, emails, and called my office to share your personal story about how the ACA helps you. That’s what I’m thinking about this morning.  I think of the countless number of people in our district and state, people we see at the grocery store, people we go to school with, and people we worship alongside, who will be impacted by changes to our healthcare system.    Alone - Republicans drafted plans that would have caused 16 million, 22 million, 23 million, and even 32 million Americans to lose health insurance. Democrats are willing to concede that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but the actions taken by Republicans is not the path forward.    So, let’s come together with a bipartisan compromise that fixes the ACA’s shortcomings but also builds on it success. Before receiving my support, any healthcare legislation must meet these requirements:   1) Does it expand coverage? 2) Does it reduce costs? 3) Does it maintain or improve quality?  I know we can do better. I know we must do better. I know Americans and Coloradans deserve better.   I will continue to fight to preserve the progress made under the ACA for the residents in my congressional district, my state, and my country. I hope you will continue to fight too.   Sincerely,  Jared","status",NA,NA,508,60,21,64,0,0,1,3

We are a brave nation that always strives to be inclusive, a nation that has a positive outlook, and a nation that decries propaganda.  With this in mind, I proposed an amendment to the spending bill that would defund the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office (VOICE). President Trump established this office as a scare-tactic in order to perpetuate the false narrative that immigrants are criminals and that they should be feared. Let me be clear: They are not. Immigration is an American tradition to be celebrated.  To counter VOICE’s propaganda, I started the Saved by American Immigrants National Taskforce or “SAINT” to highlight stories of immigrants who have contributed to our communities through heroic or lifesaving acts.  There are stories everywhere of immigrants who are SAINTs. Maytham, for example, is a skilled transplant nurse who is responsible for ensuring that donated organs remain viable following surgery. He studied to become a nurse after serving the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) as a contractor and being awarded a Special Immigrant Visa.  We are strongest as a nation, when we embrace our diversity, and people like Maytham.

Wild horses are an important part of our Colorado heritage, capturing the public imagination and inspiring people for generations to come. Ending the mistreatment and slaughtering of these animals aligns with our moral values, saves taxpayer dollars, and preserves Colorado's precious heritage.

In the years since the flood, I have been amazed by the resiliency of so many affected. For my family it meant a flooded basement and the loss of some of our treasured family photographs stored there. For others, it upended their entire lives.   Stu and Sarah Jane were new parents to their 9 mo. old daughter when the flood waters demolished their house in Fourmile Canyon.  Shortly after receiving a reverse-911 call, the canyon gave way.  The young family escaped to a firehouse up the canyon, and were offered refuge by a kind stranger.  After two days, a National Guard helicopter, like the one I went on and helped pick up survivors, flew in transporting all three to safety.  It was harrowing, but Stu says his family was fortunate – the smallest difference in circumstances would have meant his family wouldn’t be alive today.  I met Stu and Sarah Jane about 18 months after the flood.  They were trying to rebuild their lives, but were tied up in their mortgage on the flood-ravished house.   We were able to call attention to their situation, along with situation of so many others, by inviting the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Regional Director to tour the area.  That visit helped speed up the arduous process of buyouts, allowing the State and County to buy properties at pre-flood value.  For families like Stu and Sarah Jane’s, the buyout spelled relief after years of paying for a mortgage on a house that was destroyed, and allowed them to start over in a new house.  I’m proud to say that Stu and Sara Jane are still my constituents and thriving today.  As we wish our fellow Americans well towards the long rebuilding in Florida and Houston, we also reflect on our four years of recovery. For many of us it will never be the same, but together we showed that we are #ColoradoStrong","photo","https://www.facebook.com/jaredpolis/photos/a.10151838298962530.1073741827.53481427529/10155502025682530/?type=3",NA,173,10,6,17,0,2,0,0

But did you know that in Colorado and 32 other states, the cost of childcare actually exceeds the cost of college tuition? Every day, families across our state are forced to make tough decisions about childcare for their kids.   Research shows that the earliest years of a child’s life are some of the most critical. It’s incredibly important that children have the opportunity to enroll in high-quality preschool so that when they start in kindergarten, they’re ready to learn at the same level as their peers.   Despite this, less than half of three- and four-year olds in Colorado are in preschool. This is a staggering number, and it’s unacceptable. No child should be denied a good start just because of their family’s economic circumstances, and no parent should have to be faced with the burden of not being able to afford the very best for their kids.   Today, I introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, which will finally give working families the access to child care and high-quality preschool that they deserve.   The bill would provide universal access to high-quality preschool for three and four-year olds, and it would ensure that no family making less than 150 percent of state median income pays more than seven percent of their income for child care.   Our country ranks third-to-last among developed nations for enrollment in early childhood education. We can and must do better.

The bill would deny care to women in the most desperate of circumstances and is a blatant attempt to chip away at a woman’s right to choose.  Put simply - it takes away a woman’s ability to make personal medical decisions that could save her life and puts it in the hands of politicians.

Trump's ""Dirty Power Plan"" is a misguided step that will expose us to more carbon pollution and other dangerous pollutants emitted by power plants. The Clean Power Plan was a crucial health regulation- under President Obama, the EPA estimated it would have prevented up to 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 childhood asthma attacks every year. It is also a sensible policy that would have helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slowed down the effects of climate change, saving billions of dollars from rising sea levels, droughts and more intense storms.   Moving our country towards clean energy, like solar and wind power, curbs greenhouse gas emissions and is a critical step in reducing our carbon footprint. Rolling back the Clean Power Plan and its essential regulations threatens our health, our safety, and our planet.   The EPA has a legal obligation to protect the environment- settled law has determined that the EPA must issue safeguards against climate pollution under the Clean Air Act, as the Supreme Court has already concluded three times.

That block of data is then stored across a universal ledger known as blockchain, which is a permanent record book for transactions that is updated instantly and can never be altered.
