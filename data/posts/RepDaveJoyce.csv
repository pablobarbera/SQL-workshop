Again, we should continue to pursue efforts to better protect the U.S. and improve the vetting process to better protect our country.

It is a place where people swim, fish, and most importantly, get their drinking water. We need to protect it. So the idea that we would allow radioactive waste to be buried underground right next to one of the lakes is ludicrous.

These pieces of legislation are vital to the wellbeing of our nation’s veterans, and I was proud to be a cosponsor of both.  The Hire Vets Act creates a voluntary awards program to recognize the meaningful, verifiable efforts undertaken by employers, both large and small, to hire and retain veterans. These “HIRE Vets Medallions” would be awarded to deserving employers who make critical contributions to our veteran workforce. Applicants would have to pay fees to help cover the costs of the program.    The WINGMAN Act permits veterans to grant certain designated congressional employees access to their records in the databases of the Veterans Benefits Administration. The goal of this legislation is to help clear the backlog of veterans claims at the VA by giving congressional staffers the tools to more efficiently assist veterans.   Both of these bills are common sense measures to help our nation’s veterans; I look forward to the Senate quickly passing them so they can go to the President’s desk to be signed into law.","status",NA,NA,55,9,10,1,0,0,0,0

The U.S. is taking the threat to its $7-billion Great Lakes fishery very seriously. In 2015 alone, the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee (ACRCC) funded mainly by the states bordering the Great Lakes and the U.S. federal government, spent $74-million on 43 different projects designed to control Asian carp.  The problem is that federal funding is under attack. A vast amount of funding to protect the Great Lakes comes from the $300 million Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). The same GLRI legislation that I introduced last Congress and was passed by Congress and signed into law.  Rumors are trickling out that the new administration’s first budget will cut the GLRI down to the bone.  Fighting for this funding, though, is nothing new. Under President Obama we had to annually find more than $50 million to make the program whole.   The fight will now continue under the Trump administration, as regional programs like the GLRI are under assault.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDaveJoyce/photos/a.404562432957548.96929.404318572981934/1287362831344166/?type=3",NA,41,19,18,0,0,1,1,1

Congress has historically funded the GLRI to the tune of $300 million in each fiscal year.""  Here is my statement:  Rep. Dave Joyce (OH-14): “As directed under the Constitution, Congress has the power of the purse. This budget proposal is the opening volley in a long process and the idea that the Administration would eliminate a program that protects drinking water for more than 30 million people is hard to comprehend. However, like we have done in the past, we will work with all the members from the Great Lakes region and beyond to restore funding for this vital program.”","status",NA,NA,54,24,6,0,0,0,0,0

After listening to constituents, business leaders and medical professionals throughout my district, I came to the conclusion the American Health Care Act was not a better solution.   I’m eager to support legislation that doesn’t reduce funding in the Medicare trust fund and actually helps lower healthcare costs for the more than 465,000 people in my district who obtain their health insurance via their employer. Those individuals, who make up 65 percent of the district, have seen nothing but higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher co-pays. We need to find solutions to help them and their families. The middle class cannot keep bearing the brunt of everything.  I also want a process that is more deliberate, open and transparent, and that is focused actually on the doctor-patient relationship and lowering costs for everyone.

This is a vital program that was established in 2014 that allows eligible veterans to seek medical care from private health-care providers. The program was set to expire on August 7th, but our vote last week removed the expiration date and extends the program to provide valuable continuity for our nation's veterans.  Under the program, a veteran who is  seeking an appointment but unable to obtain care from the VA within 30 days or lives more than 40 miles from a VA facility, can receive care from certain private and federally sponsored providers.  Since the inception of the program three years ago, more than 1.2 million veterans have used the program, according to a report from the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee.  To me, this is commonsense legislation that provides imperative access to care to those who have given so much to our country.","status",NA,NA,51,11,1,2,0,0,0,0

Border Security: *Strengthens our borders. It is one of the largest increases in border security funding in a very long time. It provides $12.2B for Customs & Border Protection - which is $911 million above last fiscal year. This funding will go towards more agents and technological improvements to stop the flow of illegals entering our country.  *Ends “catch and release”. These increased funds will provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the resources they need to properly partner with local law enforcement to process, arrest, and book illegal immigrants into detention facilities.  *Helps our investigative teams fight against cybercrime, drug smuggling, human trafficking and child exploitation.   Pro Life: *Protects life. The bill reaffirms the Hyde amendment and prohibits federal funding of abortions.  Opioids: *Fights against the nation’s opioid epidemic by providing an additional $650 million to address the prevention and treatment.   Great Lakes: *Protects the Great Lakes.

The idea that premiums could potentially skyrocket for people with pre-existing conditions and increase 3 to 5 times for people nearing retirement is something I find unacceptable.   Another take away is how this bill would adversely affect the progress we have made to combat our opioid crisis. Our state leads the nation in opioid deaths. This bill threatens our essential health care benefits, including opioid addiction treatment.   These issues are not amenable to a quick fix. We need to take the time necessary to hold hearings and work together on a step by step basis to develop a long term solution that works for everyone.
