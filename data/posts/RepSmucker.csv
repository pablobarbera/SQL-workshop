It is entirely reasonable for a new president to ensure we are doing all we can to reduce the risk of radical Islamic terrorists infiltrating our process, and in fact absolutely necessary. Therefore, I support the temporary pause in admitting refugees from the seven identified countries into the United States. ISIS was successful in infiltrating and attacking Europe, and they have pledged to do the same in America.   Reports of green card holders and those who risked their lives assisting U.S. military personnel in the region being detained were deeply concerning. These individuals have been vetted and should absolutely be able to seek refuge immediately.   I am hopeful we will use this temporary pause to strengthen our vetting process so we can better protect both the American people and those fleeing oppression and persecution.","status",NA,NA,64,202,27,3,0,0,21,102

Prior to this letter being printed, a meeting with the letter writer and her husband was confirmed and put on my schedule, as I try to do with as many requests as possible.  I reviewed the letter writer's correspondence with my office. At no time did my scheduler “stonewall” her and say I would not meet with her. No one in my office either said or implied “too bad, no appointments.”  While hiring staff for my Lancaster and Washington offices, I placed great importance on professionalism and respect. I consistently reiterate to my staff to act with civility. My office receives dozens of meeting requests each day, and works to accommodate them as quickly as possible. Finally, I categorically reject any assertion that meetings are prioritized based on campaign contributions.  That said, in my brief time in Congress, several reports about my actions have been riddled with errors.  LNP regularly offers commentary on how public officials should do our jobs and positions or actions we should take. That’s LNP’s right and its responsibility to its readers. In the spirit of open dialogue, I suggest that in order to preserve journalistic integrity (on the ropes as of late) and to remain an accurate and objective arbiter of facts, LNP should actually confirm information that targets me by name and is presented as fact.  That is hard work. But hard work is a core value in our communities. Responsible journalism requires more. My record of responding to LNP requests for comment and access is nearly 100 percent and often within tight deadlines.  Differences of opinion, debate and engagement are welcome. Unsubstantiated claims and factual errors damage both the notions of a free press and faith in public institutions.","link","http://lancasteronline.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/congressman-lloyd-smucker-responds/article_497fa61c-0450-11e7-aa3e-7b810543dd45.html","lancasteronline.com",52,45,11,2,0,2,0,3

In many class action lawsuits, the victims receive little to no financial benefit while trial lawyers earn fees up into the millions. This legislation does not create obstacles for class action lawsuits, but instead establishes fair rules for victims.  The Innocent Party Protection Act (H.R. 725) addresses the common practice of lawyers bringing in local defendants to keep a lawsuit in a preferred state court where they think they can get a more favorable ruling. This bill would address that problem by giving federal judges more power to remove a defendant if they deem that they were fraudulently added to a case to influence the location of the court case. Too many small businesses and their employees are victims of frivolous lawsuits that result in them incurring substantial financial costs in defending themselves while trial lawyers increase their profits.","status",NA,NA,14,16,1,0,0,0,1,1

While far from perfect, passing this bipartisan funding bill today to keep the government running is the right thing to do.   However, this is just another short-term fix, and another example of Congress governing from one funding crisis to the next. That is why I have urged House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black to hold a hearing on comprehensive budget process reform. It is also why I cosponsored “No Budget, No Pay” legislation and bills to reform the broken budget process. Congress must be accountable to the American people, and the system needs to work again.   I am pleased that this bill increases funding for the National Institutes of Health, strengthens our military, reaffirms the Hyde amendment to prevent funding for abortions, and supports nationwide efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that has swept across Pennsylvania and the nation.

Premiums in Lancaster County increased 40 percent in 2017 – the highest in Pennsylvania. The entire system is unsustainable and on the verge of collapse. It’s time for change.  The American Health Care Act will help ensure Pennsylvanians have access to the care they need at a price they can afford. It returns regulatory power to the states – where it belongs – so that governors can run state-specific programs instead of a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach. It ends Obamacare’s costly mandates and provides both a market-driven system that will lower premiums, and tax relief to hardworking Americans to help make health care affordable. Finally, the bill provides protections for those with pre-existing conditions.  I urge the Senate to take up this legislation quickly and look forward to seeing its changes to help improve our health care system.","status",NA,NA,86,324,28,4,0,4,16,190

Here is The Wall Street Journal editorial from May 2nd which it explains it well:  ""Insurance coverage for pre-existing health conditions can be confusing, as President Trump and a journalist showed in a television interview over the weekend. Allow us to explain how the GOP reform would work in practice and why pre-existing conditions have been exaggerated as a political problem.   ""Mr. Trump told CBS ’s John Dickerson that “I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don’t cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.” Mr. Dickerson seemed surprised: “Okay. Well, that’s a development, sir. So you’re saying it’s going to be pre-existing to everybody?” Mr. Trump said the House bill had “evolved” but as usual didn’t explain how.   ""House conservatives rebelled over the original version of the American Health Care Act, which only partially deregulated insurance markets. The bill maintained the rule known as guaranteed issue, which requires insurers to cover all applicants regardless of medical history. It also relaxed community rating, which limits how much premiums can vary among beneficiaries.   ""The media and the left thus claim that conservatives want to allow insurers to charge sick people more, and some conservatives agree, which spooks the moderates. But the latest compromise between conservatives and centrists doesn’t repeal guaranteed issue or community rating. It keeps these regulations as the default baseline, and states could apply for a federal waiver if they want to pursue other regulatory relief.   ""But the waivers aren’t a license to leave cancer survivors without insurance. States can only receive a waiver if they avail themselves of the bill’s $100 billion fund to set up high-risk pools. These state-based programs, which were run in 35 states until they were pre-empted by ObamaCare, subsidize coverage for older and sicker patients. This helps these individuals and keeps coverage cheaper for everyone else.   ""Why might a Governor prefer such an arrangement over the ObamaCare status quo? Well, the law’s price controls are a raw deal for most consumers, which leads to a cycle of rising premiums and falling enrollment. Average premiums rose by 40% or more in 11 states this year, and insurance markets in states like Tennessee, Kentucky and Minnesota are in crisis.   ""Community rating and guaranteed issue also punish the sick by degrading quality. When insurers can profit by being the best plan for, say, cancer or diabetes, they invest in such care. When both the healthy and sick pay the same rates, the incentive is to load up on healthier people and discourage people with expensive ailments or chronic conditions from enrolling by using higher copays, narrow provider networks or tiered prescription drug formularies.   ""In a recent study of the Affordable Care Act, Daniel Prinz and Timothy J. Layton of Harvard and Michael Geruso of University of Texas-Austin conclude that insurers are using benefit designs to screen for unprofitable consumers. The result is that people with expensive conditions cannot obtain adequate coverage.   ""Pre-existing conditions are an understandably emotional issue, because people fear losing their plan or a financial catastrophe if they develop a serious health problem. But only about 4% of the population under age 65 is high risk. ObamaCare’s Pre-Existing Conditions Insurance Plan was created from 2010 to 2014 as a transition until the entitlement debuted nationwide: Anyone could sign up for heavily subsidized coverage if they were denied in the private market. Enrollment topped out at merely 115,000 people in 2013.   ""This debate is also distorted by a misunderstanding of health risks. The actuarial probability that a healthy person will become sick is already priced into premiums, meaning it is true insurance for unknown future health outcomes. People with pre-existing conditions don’t need insurance—they need help paying for expensive treatment that is already known.   ""High-risk pools are a fairer and more equitable solution to this social problem, rather than hiding the cost by forcing other people to pay premiums that are artificially higher than the value of the product. The waivers also include protections for people who renew continuous coverage from major premium increases if they become ill.   ""Liberals are inflating the pre-existing conditions panic with images of patients pushed out to sea on ice floes, but the GOP plan will ensure everyone can get the care they need. Republicans can win this argument, but first they need to join the debate and explain their ideas.""","status",NA,NA,22,118,8,1,6,0,4,59

And its approach to the individual mandate - axing it in favor of a premium hike on those with a gap in coverage - is equally sensible. The premise of both these approaches is the same: to encourage people to get and keep health coverage, so that it is truly insurance against the risk of illness. And dropping coverage mandates would allow people to buy more affordable policies to cover the very catastrophic problems most of the horror stories about the bill claim it will cause.""","link","http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/editorial-gop-should-first-do-itself-no-harm-in-health-care-bill","readingeagle.com",15,67,2,0,7,1,1,29

When I graduated from high school, I bought a small construction company from my brother that had just a few employees. When I was ready to grow that business, I didn’t go to Wall Street for a loan – I went to a community bank. They knew me, and provided the capital necessary to expand and create more jobs. There are countless stories of motivated individuals that want to harness the power of free enterprise to build something. In many ways, that’s the American Dream. Unfortunately, in today’s regulatory environment, achieving this can be extraordinarily difficult.   Over the last five months, I have worked with my colleagues in the House to provide regulatory relief to small businesses and families across Pennsylvania and the nation in order to get our economy moving again after years of stagnation. We have put Main Street – not Wall Street – at the center of our efforts.   The Financial CHOICE Act will make it easier for community banks to provide capital to entrepreneurs who want to innovate and small business owners who are ready to grow and hire more workers. It ends taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street firms, cuts the deficit by $24 billion, and reins in unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington. It’s the type of reform we need.   I am also glad that the House agreed to my amendment to help protect consumer credit data from cyberattacks. Millions of Americans trust credit reporting agencies with their personal information to help protect against fraud. But too often, these agencies are susceptible to the very cyberattacks they are charged with defending against. Multiple high-profile cyberattacks have occurred in recent years.

I was sent to Congress not to prop up the failed status quo, but to help end it. The budget we unveiled today, Building A Better America, does just that, and will put us on a path towards regular order and fiscal sanity. It will grow our economy, create more opportunity for working families, and reignite the American Dream.  Our plan balances the budget in 10 years, controls federal spending, strengthens and secures Medicare, and supports robust funding for our troops to keep our homeland safe. Importantly, this plan also provides instructions for necessary fundamental tax reform that will reduce rates, simplify the code, and create jobs. It also uses reconciliation to address mandatory spending, which hasn’t been done in more than a decade. I want to commend Chairman Diane Black for her work on this budget that will bring greater accountability and responsibility to the way we govern.","link","https://smucker.house.gov/media/press-releases/smucker-statement-fy18-budget-resolution","smucker.house.gov",34,29,7,3,0,0,0,8

Russia claims sovereign nations as its own, conducts cyber-attacks aimed at dismantling democracy, including in the United States, and props up the murderous Assad regime. This package of sanctions renews our commitment to our allies and gives the U.S. the leverage needed to hold these nations accountable for their actions.

Additionally, it ends federal funding of Planned Parenthood, rolls back job-killing regulations, and reforms the Internal Revenue Service.  This effort is also a step towards restoring regular order in Congress. The appropriations bills started in subcommittees, were approved by the full committees, and moved to the House floor where they were open to hundreds of amendments offered by members on both sides of the aisle after weeks of consideration.  I made a commitment to help put us on a sustainable fiscal path, be a good steward of taxpayer dollars, and help end the status quo in Washington.

Our current federal tax code is broken, but we have the fix: give American families the opportunity to improve their lives through a simplified tax code.  The plan cuts taxes for all Americans. This means bigger paychecks and more financial stability for millions of families that too often must tighten their household budgets because of stagnant wages. It means mothers and fathers can more easily save for their children’s college fund and plan for retirement. And it means it will be easier for young people graduating from high school and college to get a job, buy a home, and start a family.  I went to Washington to improve the lives of the people I represent. These are exactly the types of reforms I wanted to see in a tax reform plan, and now is our best opportunity to reignite the American Dream. I’m proud of the effort that went into this framework, and I look forward to the work that lies ahead.","link","https://smucker.house.gov/media/press-releases/smucker-statement-republican-tax-reform-framework","smucker.house.gov",69,71,8,3,5,0,0,5

Our Congressional District is home to more than 72,000 Puerto Ricans. For many of our neighbors, this terrible event has a personal impact. It is critical that federal resources are used efficiently and effectively to support Americans impacted by this disaster. That is why I sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Elaine Duke asking her to extend federal cost sharing from six months to one full year, and to brief Congress on relief efforts as soon as practicable.  This process of rebuilding will be an ongoing effort. I’ve been in regular contact with the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon, about the needs on the island.

Importantly, this budget resolution lays the groundwork for tax reform that will give American families more opportunity to improve their lives. I spoke with a constituent recently – a single father of five in Lancaster County – who asked me if our tax plan would mean more money in his paycheck. He makes his income work today, but it’s difficult for him and his family. Families like this are exactly the type of Americans we are trying to help with our reforms.  Too many Americans today do everything right, but still struggle to make ends meet. My constituents deserve this plan because they should have a more honest federal tax code and a simplified filing process that allows them to spend more time with their families, to save for their children’s college fund, or to plan for their retirement.

Trump today.  Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a veteran and clinical psychologist working at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Tomah, Wisconsin. When he realized that his patients were being overly medicated, he raised the issue with his superiors. Fearing backlash, his superiors told him to mind his own business, and subsequently found ways to discipline him in retaliation. He was eventually fired, and sadly took his own life later that night. A subsequent investigation through OIG found that his claims were valid, and that patients were indeed being overmedicated. Another investigation found that the VA frequently uses an employee’s medical records (as they did with Dr. Kirkpatrick) to slander whistleblower employees.   Our legislation aims to ensures that accessing the medical file of an employee in retaliation for blowing the whistle – something that OSC says happens all too often at the VA – is treated as a prohibited personnel action and that supervisors are punished accordingly. It also requires the VA to come up with a plan to restrict unauthorized employee access to medical files. Additionally, it adds protections for probationary period whistleblowers who are retaliated against; ensures federal employees have a better understanding of whistleblower protections and their rights; and sets minimum discipline standards across all agencies for retaliation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSmucker/photos/a.168034642814.120110.78825262814/10155198388177815/?type=3",NA,31,12,4,0,1,0,1,0

This plan provides the relief families in our district have been waiting for and it’s what they deserve.  Under our plan, a family of four making $59,000 per year will reduce their tax liability by $1,182. It lowers rates so that hardworking men and women will see more money in their paychecks. It significantly increases the standard deduction, which seventy percent of filers in our district currently use. It increases the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 to help with the cost of raising children. It reduces the tax burden on small businesses so Main Street can thrive. And it simplifies our code and makes it more honest. These changes will result in more jobs and higher wages by reinvesting in our economy and will make the American workforce more globally competitive. Simply put, this is a game-changer.  I encourage every constituent to visit my website where they can see the details for themselves and learn how it will impact them. I’m confident my constituents will see this plan for what it is: a direct investment in hardworking Americans and the innovative, entrepreneurial spirit that built this great nation.

He’s the father of four young children and he thinks about tax reform through the lens of a father and a husband. He’s excited that tax reform means a bigger child tax credit, and a simplified filing process means more time to spend with his family.  Cinthia Kettering runs a successful insurance brokerage firm in Lancaster. She would love to pay her employees more, but the burdensome federal tax code and high rates often prevent her from awarding those raises. Tax reform allows her to reinvest in her employees and grow her company.  Travis Eby and his brother Nick own and operate M.H. Eby in eastern Lancaster County, which manufactures truck bodies for commercial and agricultural markets and was founded by their grandfather in 1938. When asked what he would do with tax savings as a result of our tax reform plan, Travis said, “We would continue to invest in our employees.”  Tom Duff is the CEO of Mount Joy Wire — a leader in manufacturing wire for aerospace, automotive, medical and many other applications. Tom wants to better compete with foreign competitors. Tax reform will help make his Pennsylvania workers, who pride themselves on “Made in the USA,” more competitive in an increasingly global economy.","link","https://smucker.house.gov/media/in-the-news/done-right-way-tax-reform-game-changer","smucker.house.gov",33,45,4,2,2,0,0,9

America’s military is made up of hardworking men and women who wake up every day to serve others. We should be making it easier for them to transition to civilian life with a steady job, and infuse our workforce with leadership skills only the military can provide. But right now, less than half of our nation’s military personnel have access to USMAP and the completion rate for those who do enroll is falling at an alarming rate. This amendment will open up USMAP to any member of the uniformed service. I’m proud to work in a bipartisan manner with Reps. Gottheimer and Sinema to get this amendment included in the conference report, and I am glad President Trump has signed this legislation into law.","link","https://smucker.house.gov/media/press-releases/national-defense-authorization-act-including-smucker-amendment-signed-law","smucker.house.gov",17,10,2,3,1,0,1,4

Today, our complex and outdated federal tax code leaves families feeling like they’re doing everything right, but still struggling to make ends meet. The status quo on taxes is failing the middle class.  Throughout this past year, I have been hearing from constituents about what tax reform should do for them and their families. They want a simpler, more honest federal tax code that lets them keep more of their paycheck and restores American competitiveness – and that’s what this bill does.  I have also had conversations with constituents about specific provisions in our tax bill that have been good for our community. Our older population has been able to reduce its tax liability because of the deduction for medical expenses. Cities like Lancaster, Reading, and Coatesville have taken advantage of the New Market and Historic Tax Credits to jumpstart economic activity and put people back to work. I fought to retain these important provisions to help ensure this tax plan works for our district.  The IRS has told President Trump that, if signed into law before Christmas, the lower rates will be effective as soon as February. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation so hardworking Americans can keep more of their own money.","link","https://smucker.house.gov/media/press-releases/smucker-statement-house-passage-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-conference-report","smucker.house.gov",59,153,8,14,1,1,3,80
