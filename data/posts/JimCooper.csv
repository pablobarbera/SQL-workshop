It is my hope that there are Republicans in the House who will cross party lines to support it.  I am more worried about the future of America than I have been in a long, long time. Even the headline in today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal, often viewed as a Republican newspaper, says, ‚ÄúImmigration Order Sows Chaos.‚Äù Our President should not be sowing chaos.  The President‚Äôs Executive Orders on immigration this past weekend were confusing, irresponsible and make America less safe. For example, Trump is denying entry to Iraqis and Kurds who helped U.S. troops survive during the war. Trump was also temporarily exiling green card holders who are legally permitted to be in the United States.   Gen. John Kelly, Trump‚Äôs Homeland Security Secretary, clarified the President‚Äôs order by saying that allowing green card holders to return to the U.S. is ‚Äúin the national interest.‚Äù  Gen. Michael Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, Deputy Director of National Intelligence and Director of the CIA, calls the refugee order a ‚Äúpolitical, ideological move‚Äù that makes us less safe because it verifies the jihadists‚Äô propaganda.  I‚Äôm thankful for Republicans, including Senators Alexander, Corker, McCain and Graham, who are opposing the President‚Äôs actions.    Just as concerning is the sudden reorganization of the National Security Council, which gives Trump advisor Steve Bannon a permanent seat on the council, and diminishes the role of our key military experts, such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. This is a radical, dangerous change.  Locally, a Kurdish family was bound for Nashville on special immigrant visas. They were sent back to the Middle East after spending years undergoing intense vetting. The father previously worked as a translator at an organization contracted by the U.S. government.

Bob Corker's criticism of the Senate process for drafting a health care bill.   No hearings, no experts, no real debate? And you are deliberately bypassing the Senate HELP Committee with a special committee that you appointed that is comprised of 13 white male Republicans? You are deliberately omitting Republican women senators and Republican physician senators? And, of course, you are omitting all Democratic senators. Why are you refusing to even try to be bipartisan?  We read today in The New York Times that you might accept emailed comments, if they are submitted today. What is this new process? An email hearing? Aren't you just confirming Sen. Corker's suspicions? No hearings, no witnesses, no in-person testimony?   Is this any way to run the U.S. Senate? No. This is an abomination. What once was viewed as the world's greatest deliberative body is being reduced to a shadow of its former self, under your leadership.  The most recent CBO analysis of the House bill indicates that it will hurt 24 million Americans. Your short-circuiting the Senate could do even more damage.   A better course of action would be to hold real hearings on the problems of Obamacare, and to make a serious, bipartisan effort to fix any such problems. That would be the way the U.S. Senate is supposed to function.  Give it a try,  Rep.

Although it can be painted to look good in the next few years, the bill makes false promises that will hurt at least 32 million Americans, and hurt them very soon. How many hundreds of thousands of those victims are Tennesseans?  Almost everyone who knows anything about health care is strongly against this bill. Why? This bill is a cynical attempt to buy barely enough Republican votes by bribing Southern states to overlook the horrific national damage the bill will cause with $4 trillion in overall cuts. Southern states will suffer, too.   To call this a ""states‚Äô rights"" approach to health reform is a lie. It is a race to the bottom, with each state competing to be crueler to its citizens by denying them health insurance and health care. America deserves better, much better, and I am working to persuade enough Republicans with a soul to stop this devastatingly partisan attack on all Americans.  A much better course of action would have been to let our own senator, Lamar Alexander, complete his efforts to craft a bipartisan health reform bill. He has been trying but has been betrayed by his own political party. Apparently, now, even he has given up. That is a tragic mistake. Without bipartisanship, Republicans will merely be repeating the mistakes of previous partisan reform efforts, which Republicans have long criticized. By not learning the lessons of history, Republicans are doomed to repeat history‚Äôs mistakes. This bill simply must be stopped!  https://cooper.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cooper-disagrees-with-governor-haslam-senators-alexander-and-corker","link","https://cooper.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cooper-disagrees-with-governor-haslam-senators-alexander-and-corker","cooper.house.gov",602,129,142,43,0,6,51,36

We are still learning all the facts of the horrific attack in Las Vegas, but we know an evil person used a gun to murder or wound hundreds of innocent people enjoying their lives, including at least one Tennessean. Mass shootings happen in America far too frequently; we were just reminded of that when tragedy struck in Antioch. I am furious that Congress continues to do nothing. Last Congress, House Republican leadership refused to consider any gun legislation, even after Democrats organized a sit-in to force a vote. In fact, Republicans still want to loosen gun laws. I hope they now see the need to abandon those plans and begin debate on what common-sense measures could minimize risk. Elected representatives in America should be allowed to solve problems. Our job is to vote, not duck.   https://www.facebook.com/HouseDemocrats/videos/10155644151053548/","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JimCooper/photos/a.109819456391.94873.6627436391/10155877467201392/?type=3",NA,1806,420,156,209,4,1,43,27
