We see it in the courtroom when someone is required to tell the truth. We see it when the President is sworn in. But we rarely take time to reflect on its deeper sense. We see it more like an old tradition, a time-honored nostalgic exercise. However, the oath is a solemn declaration. It is a pause, the start of sacred duty. By taking an oath, you effectively hold yourself as ransom. You commit, at the deepest levels, that you will perform these tasks to the best of your ability. It is the ultimate measure and test of integrity. If violated, you tear the center of being to the detriment of yourself and of the community. This is a very high bar. https://fortenberry.house.gov/media-center/fort-reports/oath-office","link","https://fortenberry.house.gov/media-center/fort-reports/oath-office","fortenberry.house.gov",52,15,1,2,0,0,0,0

Our acts of soft power, including diplomatic, cultural, and educational exchanges, as well as Voice of America broadcasts which helped tap into the deepest longings of the Russian people played a vital role in the eventual collapse of the Iron Curtain.","link","https://fortenberry.house.gov/media-center/fort-reports/fort-report-russia-0#.WMbJDXvxbRI.facebook","fortenberry.house.gov",39,8,3,1,0,0,0,0

I was honored to welcome the Malawi Ambassador, His Excellency Edward Yakobe Sawerengera, and the Mayor of Blantyre, the Honorable Wild Ndipo, to my office today.  We had a good discussion about education, agriculture, and conservation practices.  We found that we shared similar thoughts on many of these issues.   The Ambassador also told me that everyone in Malawi smiles – I like that!  I look forward to continuing our cultural and economic relationship with this smiling African nation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/jefffortenberry/photos/a.269182657354.143995.48426842354/10158075335392355/?type=3",NA,46,3,1,1,0,0,0,1
