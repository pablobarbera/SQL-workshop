They were concerned about the federal budget, divisiveness in Washington, and told the congresswoman they appreciated her effectiveness, especially with a Republican-controlled House, Senate, and Administration.   The issues that hit closest to home for the Molokai ªi residents included Rep. Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs work to reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Education Act, improve access to quality, affordable healthcare, and support ""Medicare for All"" legislation, and her commitment to protecting the environment and our precious water resources.

If Kim Jong-un or someone else launched ballistic missiles‚ÄîICBMs‚Äîagainst the United States, we would have to make the decision on which ones to take out or not.‚Äù  Following the hearing Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, ‚ÄúHawai ªi is home to the largest concentration of U.S. military strategic assets for well over 3,000 miles, making it a prime target for North Korea‚Äôs aggression. As I travelled across Hawai‚Äôi during my recent state-wide town hall tour, I heard from my constituents on every island their concern about the threat posed by North Korea‚Äôs increased nuclear and ballistic missile activity and capabilities that place Hawai ªi squarely within North Korea's crosshairs. It is the people of Hawai ªi and our way of life that are at risk if North Korea‚Äôs missiles turn towards our shores. Admiral Harris‚Äô testimony today affirmed the seriousness of this threat, and highlighted the need to strengthen our current missile defense infrastructure to ensure the defense of Hawai'i. I'm continuing this urgent push to strengthen the protection of Hawai ªi against the threat that exists today, and the complex threat we know will emerge in the future. I urge my colleagues to take this threat seriously and provide the resources and tools necessary to defend Hawai ªi against this threat.‚Äù","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepTulsiGabbard/videos/1341581035928407/",NA,559,158,244,16,2,79,84,20

Tulsi Gabbard Honors Fallen Officers and Families at Law Enforcement Memorial Service  ---  Hawai ªi Law Enforcement Memorial Service Remarks by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard May 14, 2017   Aloha. I am honored to be here with you all on this very important evening.   I want to extend my thanks and gratitude to the officers here today, those who are not with us, those who are still serving and those who have paid the ultimate price.  I also want to pay tribute to your families‚Äîwithout whose support and love, your service would not be possible.      My younger sister is a law enforcement officer.  She is a Deputy US Marshal, works out of Washington, DC right now, and for the last seven years, has participated in the Police Unity Tour, which is a bicycle ride that begins in New Jersey and ends in Washington, DC. It goes over four days, and thousands of law enforcement officers from all across the country participate to raise awareness for those who have died in the line of duty in the previous year.  It raises money for memorials like this across the country and for the families of the officers who have fallen.  I had the opportunity last year to attend the 28th Annual Candlelight Vigil in Washington, DC at the National Mall.  We joined the family of Hawaii‚Äôs own Captain Neville Colburn.   One of the things that was so striking about that vigil were the thousands of people‚Äîthe candles stretched as far as the eye could see down the National Mall‚Äîpeople from all parts of the country, people representing every age, race, ethnicity, religion, and creed, representing the diversity that exists within our communities and our country.  Each were holding a candle, each remembering the service and sacrifice of a loved one, a friend, a colleague, but all standing together in unity.  Recognizing and feeling in that moment that even in the darkest and most difficult of times that we‚Äôre all connected and that we‚Äôre all in this together.       This memorial here and this opportunity we have today reminds us of the thin blue line‚Äîthat symbol which represents the important relationship between law enforcement and our community as the protectors of fellow civilians from those who seek to harm them.  It symbolizes that great trust and responsibility that exists within those who carry the badge.  It reminds us of those who are called to put their lives on the line to serve and protect and those who have sacrificed all.     As I was thinking of this day and coming to join you, my thought was, how can we best honor them?  We can remember them today as we are.  But I think the best way we can honor them is through our own lives.  And the way that we choose to live our lives.  Whether in law enforcement, in politics, in government, or in the private sector, or any field‚Äîwe have the opportunity to do our very best every day, to be of service to others, to live not for ourselves, but to make that positive impact on those around us.  To look around our community, to look around our home, and see how can I be part of the solution.        We miss them‚Äîour friends, our family members, colleagues.  They will always remain with us in our hearts, in our memories, and in the legacy they‚Äôve left behind.  Let us honor them through our gratitude, not wasting a moment.  Remembering that for any one of us, we don‚Äôt know when our time will come.  So let‚Äôs make the most of it by honoring our fallen heroes today and every day of our lives by trying to live a life of service.    Thank you for your service. Mahalo.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepTulsiGabbard/videos/1359991534087357/",NA,424,30,76,65,0,2,1,0

Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02) and Tom Garrett (VA-05) hosted a press conference today urging Congress to pass H.R.1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act. They were joined by Beth Collins and Lisa Smith who shared their personal stories of how by providing CBD oil to their children who suffer from near-constant seizures, they risk Federal prosecution simply due to the conflicting laws between the state and Federal government. If passed, the bill would take marijuana off the federal controlled substances list‚Äîtreating it the same as substances like alcohol and tobacco.  Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, ‚ÄúOur archaic Federal laws relating to marijuana are hurting people, tearing families apart, turning everyday Americans into criminals, and negatively impacting our economy, all at a tremendous cost to taxpayers as billions are spent on an over-burdened and broken criminal justice system. As the opioid addiction epidemic continues to spread across the country, states that have legalized medical marijuana have seen addiction rates drop and opioid abuse deaths decrease by over 20%. Medical marijuana has helped children like Haley Smith living with Dravet syndrome reduce her seizures and other symptoms. But her mother Lisa lives with the fear of Federal prosecution every day. Our current policy makes no sense. This bill is a bipartisan effort that will be a great step forward in solving many of the fiscal and social challenges that our current policy is causing, and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.‚Äù","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTulsiGabbard/photos/a.395389750547545.96385.392284484191405/1363584150394762/?type=3",NA,770,38,205,127,0,1,0,0

Tulsi Gabbard arranged a congressional proclamation that was presented to Senator Akaka this afternoon, which includes the following:   Daniel K. Akaka served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during World War II, in the Hawai ªi Department of Education as a teacher and principal, in the U.S. House of Representatives for thirteen years beginning in 1976, and in the U.S. Senate as its first Native Hawaiian Member for twenty-two years beginning in 1990.  Senator Akaka has always sought to do what is pono, including his fight for Native Hawaiian rights, educational opportunities, and the best path forward towards reconciling the wrongs that have long-suppressed Hawaii‚Äôs host population and culture.   Crediting the GI Bill with providing him not only an education, but the structure and direction he needed to discern a path forward following the end of the war, Akaka committed himself early on to serving and caring other veterans. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, he dedicated years to helping service members, veterans, and their families, expanding Veterans Administration services, and passing a new 21st Century GI Bill that continues to serve our returning heroes, helping them to move forward with their lives in the same way it helped him.    In his farewell address, Senator Akaka urged his colleagues in the U.S. Senate, ‚ÄúDo everything you can for our veterans and their families‚Ä¶ because we asked them to sacrifice so much for us.‚Äù He worked hard for Hawai ªi and our country, and he accomplished more than one proclamation could ever describe, but perhaps his greatest legacy will be his sharing the aloha spirit with so many leaders in our nation‚Äôs capital and around the world, teaching us all to respect others and care for one another always.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTulsiGabbard/photos/a.395389750547545.96385.392284484191405/1372818389471338/?type=3",NA,202,8,6,22,0,0,0,0

The 2015 hurricane season set a record of 15 tropical storms in Hawai ªi, acidification of our oceans has killed marine ecosystems and fisheries, bleached coral reefs, while causing damage to local economies.

Tulsi Gabbard released the following statement after North Korea‚Äôs recent successful Intercontinental Ballistic Missile test:   ‚ÄúNorth Korea‚Äôs latest successful intercontinental ballistic missile test further demonstrates the extremely dangerous and growing threat that North Korea poses to Hawai ªi, Alaska, and the mainland United States.  For the past fifteen years, our leaders have let the people of Hawai ªi and our country down, allowing the situation in North Korea to worsen to this point of crisis where we are left with nothing but bad options. We must ensure we are able to defend against North Korea‚Äôs threat with cutting-edge missile defense technologies, but this is not enough. We must pursue serious diplomatic efforts to de-escalate and ultimately denuclearize North Korea. However, U.S. leaders need to understand that Kim Jong Un maintains a tight grip on North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons as a deterrent against regime change. The Trump Administration would be far more credible in finding a diplomatic solution with North Korea if we weren‚Äôt currently waging a regime change war in Syria, and contemplating a regime change war in Iran.     ‚ÄúThe North Korean regime witnessed the regime change wars the U.S. led in Libya and Iraq and what we‚Äôre now doing in Syria, and fear they will become like Gadhafi who, after giving up his nuclear weapons program, was deposed by the United States.    ‚ÄúAs long as the U.S. is waging regime change wars, we are far less likely to reach a diplomatic solution in North Korea because they have no reason to believe our promises.  In fact, we are far more likely to see nuclear proliferation by countries like North Korea who see nuclear weapons as their only deterrent against regime change.     ‚ÄúSerious diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula will require an end to our regime change war in Syria and a public statement that the U.S. will not engage in regime change wars and nation-building overseas, including in Iran and North Korea. We should focus our limited resources on rebuilding our own country and seriously commit ourselves to de-escalating this dangerous stand-off with North Korea and negotiate a peaceful diplomatic solution.‚Äù","status",NA,NA,1403,182,407,176,2,38,12,12

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard spoke on the floor urging support for the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act which she helped introduce earlier this year that funds programs at the federal, state, and local level to identify and prosecute human traffickers in order to better protect and defend against abuse.  Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said:   ‚ÄúToo often we hear about human trafficking and sex slavery and dismiss it as a crime that only happens overseas or in a foreign country. The Global Slavery Index estimated that nearly 46 million people across 167 countries were victims of human trafficking in 2016. Here at home, human trafficking is also a problem where we have children and young people forced or coerced into sex work and hard labor in our communities all across the country.   ‚ÄúAs America‚Äôs gateway to Asia, my home state of Hawaii sees people taken from their homes and exploited here on our shores. In 2010, the FBI freed 400 Thai nationals from a Hawaii farm, the largest human trafficking case in our modern history.  In Hawaii, I know girls as young as 11 and 13 years old who are recruited from schools, malls, and beaches to be exploited by traffickers. While every state, including Hawaii, have passed legislation to ban trafficking and classify it as a felony, stronger and further action is needed to combat this modern international slave trade.   ‚ÄúThe Frederick Douglass Protection and Prevention Act will expand programs to help educators recognize and respond to signs of minors being exploited by human traffickers and support local law enforcement officials as they identify prosecutors to focus on sex and slave trafficking cases.

The legislation passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and is widely supported by veteran and education advocacy organizations, including Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Enlisted Association of The National Guard of The United States, the American Council on Education, the Association of American  Universities, the STEM Education Coalition, and others.     ‚ÄúEvery single day, roughly 500 veterans are transitioning from military life to civilian life, joining the more than 2.9 million veterans who have returned home since 9/11 alone. We have a responsibility to ensure that our troops and veterans are set up for success in the 21st century economy when they lay down the uniform and transition to civilian life. This bipartisan legislation enhances existing benefits, expands eligibility, eliminates bureaucratic barriers, and empowers our troops, veterans and their dependents to get the quality education they‚Äôve earned and deserve. More than 7,000 Hawai ªi veterans used their earned education benefit to open the door to new opportunities for them and their families last year, and this law will help our next generation of service members to further build on this progress,‚Äù said Rep.

Last week on Maui, I had the opportunity to hear from some of Hawaii‚Äôs DREAMers and hear their heart-wrenching stories about living in fear and in the shadows until DACA was put into effect.

This legislation eliminates tax giveaways to the fossil fuel industry, and provides support to transitioning workers who will be impacted by this generational change.    Rep. Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs bill builds on progress made in Hawai‚Äòi and other states that have committed to address the climate change crisis head on and do everything possible to transition to a 100 percent clean energy economy. The OFF Act continues this progress and sets an ambitious timeline to cut carbon emissions by ending America‚Äôs reliance on fossil fuels by 2035 in order to avert some of the most devastating impacts of climate change. Transitioning to clean energy will stimulate our economy, support our working men and women, and protect our environment.  It will increase our competitiveness by investing in clean energy technologies, jobs, and training programs. Additionally, it will improve the health and wellbeing of the American people and our planet from toxic pollutants, asthma and respiratory illnesses, and environmental degradation.  Congresswoman Gabbard‚Äôs OFF Act is currently supported by environmental advocates and co-sponsors including Rep. Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Rep. Barbara Lee (CA-13), Rep. Nanette Barrag√°n (CA-44), Rep. Ted Lieu (CA-33), Jan Schakowsky (IL-9), and Keith Ellison (MN-05) and has been endorsed by over 100 clean energy, climate change, and environmental justice organizations.  ‚ÄúThrough extreme weather events, dramatically rising sea levels, negative impacts on our environment, and record high temperatures, we continue to see the devastating consequences of climate change. My home state of Hawai‚Äòi has experienced this directly through record-breaking sea levels, high surf that has eroded land beneath homes and made roads impassable, and rising ocean temperatures that have dramatically altered marine life and destroyed our coral reefs. Hawai‚Äòi has led by example as the first state in the nation to adopt a 100 percent clean energy goal.  It‚Äôs long past time for the federal government to take action for the sake of our people, our planet, and our future.  ‚ÄúAll across the country, industrial cities, coastal communities, and urban neighborhoods have been most impacted by the negative effects of years of pollution, stagnating wages, and unemployment. These communities are being hardest hit by increases in illness and disease, economic hardship, and food shortages. Twenty-first century problems demand twenty-first century solutions. By investing in green technologies and ending corporate hand outs to the fossil fuel industry, we can grow the economy, create good jobs, and protect our environment. The promise of a clean energy economy is one of skilled, good-paying jobs, advanced and sustainable infrastructure, and clean and safe neighborhoods.  ‚ÄúThe transition to a 100 percent clean energy economy will not be easy. We must work together to address the challenges we face by listening to people in all sectors of the economy to build the path forward that will help our country end our dependence on fossil fuels and build a bridge to a clean energy future. It will take a commitment from both the public and private sector to work with energy companies, utilities, and transportation and industrial businesses to deploy the energy technologies that will transform our existing energy infrastructure today, while developing cutting edge solutions in the decades leading up to 2035. If the federal government does not act now and bring people together to solve this challenge, we will fail to protect future generations of Americans from the devastating economic and environmental consequences of climate change. ‚ÄúWe must do all we can to end our addiction to fossil fuels and deploy the technologies that will put America on the path toward a clean, sustainable energy future today and in the years to come. I call on my fellow lawmakers, and all Americans, to support the OFF Act to protect the people and our planet by committing to a 100 percent clean energy economy.‚Äù - TG","status",NA,NA,750,81,218,166,4,3,0,2

This practice creates a loophole for states that have adopted stringent, constitutionally sound asset forfeiture laws and allows them to continue practices that are otherwise deemed illegal at the state level.   ‚ÄúAttorney General Sessions' recent announcement to expand civil asset forfeiture allows local law enforcement to bypass state laws and seize property from people with the lowest possible burden of evidence without concern for whether the person is eventually charged or convicted.    ‚ÄúWhile some will tell you this is necessary to go after big drug cartels, the reality is the median value of the adoptive forfeiture seizures is around $9,000. Not only is this median value not a sign of major drug trafficking operations, but seizures tend to be focused on poorer neighborhoods. Between 2012 and 2017, the median value of assets seized by Cook County police was just over $1,000; in Philadelphia in 2015, the median value was just $192.     ‚ÄúThis policy does not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty. Rather, this policy places the responsibility on private citizens to prove their innocence rather than put the appropriate burden on law enforcement to prove guilt. All too often, innocent people without legal representation never see their money or property again, and even those who are proven innocent have no promise their property will be returned.   ‚ÄúThe Fifth Amendment of the Constitution exists to protect the citizens of this country from being deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. In practice and in principle, adoptive forfeiture is a violation of that Fifth Amendment.‚Äù - TG.","status",NA,NA,1095,65,228,140,0,15,2,5

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said:   ‚ÄúI rise today in support of an Amendment to provide additional funding for the Native American CDFI Assistance Program.

In Armenia, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard met with President Sargsyan, Prime Minister Karapetyan, distinguished members of the Ministry, representatives from Armenia‚Äôs National Assembly, Americans of Armenian ancestry, and a wide range of business, academic, and community leaders to discuss areas of mutual interest to strengthen regional and national security efforts, enhance humanitarian assistance for refugees, build economic opportunities, learn about the ongoing conflict and struggle of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, and to pay tribute to the victims of the Armenian Genocide.    Last year, Hawaii‚Äôs State Legislature passed a resolution recognizing the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and previously, along with 46 other states, passed legislation formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide, and honoring its victims.    Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said:   ‚ÄúI traveled to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh with a bipartisan group of congressional colleagues to hear and see firsthand the challenges and opportunities that exist within Armenia and the region, and identify areas of mutual interest and cooperation that will strengthen the security, economic, and cultural relationships that bind our two countries. Focusing on the priorities of a peaceful, sustainable, and secure region remains the key to deepening the American-Armenian relationship.    ‚ÄúThe resilience and courage I witnessed in the people of the Nagorno-Karabakh region who remain in an ongoing conflict over their independence, further demonstrates our shared values of freedom, democracy, and self-determination. We must support a diplomatic resolution to this ongoing conflict, such as what has been proposed by the Minsk Group (made up of the United States, France, and Russia), to allow for the people of  Nagorno-Karabakh to exercise their freedom and independence.   ‚ÄúOne major issue that continues to be unresolved, is global recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide. It is unconscionable that the United States government still has not formally recognized and condemned the Armenian genocide.  I stand with Armenians in America and around the world in condemning the Armenian Genocide, and I call on my colleagues to adopt House Resolution 220 so we never forget, or repeat, the suffering endured by the Armenian people.    ‚ÄúWhile there is much progress to be made within Armenia, the resilience of the Armenian people, their rich culture, values, and the depth of economic and academic investment I witnessed during my trip leaves me hopeful for the future of Armenia and the region.‚Äù","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTulsiGabbard/photos/a.395389750547545.96385.392284484191405/1493826067370569/?type=3",NA,186,16,23,17,0,0,0,0

The FCC announced in a Notice of Inquiry that it would consider lowering the standards of broadband Internet access speeds from 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload to 10 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload, while also classifying a mobile Internet connection as a suitable replacement for home broadband.   Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said:   ‚ÄúIt is indisputable that high-speed broadband Internet access is essential to succeed in today‚Äôs economy, and that rural, tribal and low-income communities already face significant obstacles to accessing 21st century jobs, training programs, and educational opportunities.  According to the FCC‚Äôs own 2016 report, 39 percent of rural Americans and 41 percent of tribal communities lack access to acceptable internet speeds, creating significant obstacles that often inhibit them from doing things like promoting their business, communicating with their families, and accessing education tools.  I‚Äôve heard this firsthand from constituents in my district who live in very rural communities.  Often, the only access to the Internet for kids in school was through a parent‚Äôs wireless hotspot signal.  ‚ÄúThe FCC should be looking at how to expand and strengthen the infrastructure and high-speed Internet in America‚Äôs rural, tribal and low-income communities.  By opting instead to lower the bar and redefine what constitutes an acceptable Internet connection, the FCC continues on its current trend towards favoring corporate interests over American consumers.  Should the FCC‚Äôs proposals move forward, they will create more obstacles for working Americans by putting them behind the technology curve.   ‚ÄúI firmly support the expansion of high-speed Internet access to rural and tribal areas, which is why I cosponsored H.

She also talked about the United States‚Äô broken and outdated immigration system and the need for reforms, family reunification for WWII Filipino veterans in Hawai ªi, her work to restore access to federal healthcare for Compact of Free Association (COFA) migrants, expanding access to federal immigration services on the neighbor islands, and more.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, ‚ÄúThe majority of Americans can trace their history through their relatives and ancestors who, against all odds and great difficulties, found their way to and made a home here in the U.S. But while our family histories remind us of how far we have come, the heartbreak and suffering faced by millions of families across the country due to our broken immigration system demonstrates the need for real reforms. Today, the lives of hundreds of thousands of our neighbors and friends are on hold as they wait for U.S. leaders to take action on DACA. Congress must take action to pass legislation that will provide a permanent solution for DACA recipients, who are fearful they will be targeted and deported from the only home they‚Äôve ever known.

The pervasive hijacking of our government by the drug industry who have been buying their way into Congress has led to their influence in crafting every piece of legislation impacting the opioid crisis. These drug companies spent $102 million lobbying Congress from 2014 to 2016 alone, and their buying power has worked exactly as intended. Just last year, a handful of members of Congress allied with the drug industry snuck an industry-friendly bill through Congress without a recorded vote that watered down the DEA‚Äôs enforcement efforts so they couldn‚Äôt crack down on the spread of opioids on the street. But this corruptive influence is not new‚Äîfor decades major pharmaceutical companies have lied to the FDA, doctors, and the American people about the addictive nature of opioid drugs, just so they could sell more and rake in the profits.    ‚ÄúThe drug industry has stood by and cashed in while hundreds of thousands of Americans die in the opioid epidemic, and millions more suffer in one of the greatest public health crises of our time. These giant pharmaceutical companies must be prosecuted and held accountable for the deaths and lives that have been ruined as a result of their greed and lies.   ‚ÄúWith 91 American lives lost every day to the opioid epidemic, we need real and immediate reform that puts the lives and wellbeing of the American people over the profits of the pharmaceutical and drug industry. I am pushing for legislation that will repeal the 2016 legislation that weakened the DEA, to ensure they have the authority needed to crack down on the drug industry, and prevent these drugs from hitting our streets.

Tulsi Gabbard, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, US Rep Nanette Diaz Barrag√°n joined Food & Water Watch, first responders, non-profit organizations, and local government officials to urge Members of Congress to pass H.R. 3671, the OFF Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act (#OFFAct) to transition the United States to a 100 percent clean energy economy by 2035.  Rep. Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs bill prioritizes the health and wellbeing of the country and the future of the planet by tackling the climate change crisis head on and building on the progress of states like Hawai‚Äòi. The OFF Act sets an ambitious timeline to end America‚Äôs reliance on fossil fuels by 2035 to avert the catastrophic effects of climate change that have exacerbated natural disasters like the recent hurricanes that devastated Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and deadly wildfires in California.   Without urgent action, climate change will continue to intensify and accelerate the pace of extreme weather events that devastate coastal and low-lying communities causing widespread unemployment, wage stagnation, and deadly health problems, which disproportionately affect low-income, minority, Native Hawaiian and Native American families. This legislation protects the country‚Äôs most vulnerable populations from the harmful effects of carbon emissions and toxic chemicals that pollute America‚Äôs air, land and waterways by strengthening civil rights protections, creating clean energy jobs, and prioritizing the safety and security of the planet above profits for major corporations and the fossil fuels industry.  Passing the OFF Act will transition the country away from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy, which will increase America‚Äôs global competitiveness by creating domestic clean technologies, jobs, and training programs. In addition, this legislation will improve the health and wellbeing of the American people and our planet from toxic pollutants, asthma and respiratory illnesses, and environmental degradation.

The budget resolution would provide tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, raise taxes on hard-working middle class families, increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion, gut crucial healthcare, education, research, and social service programs for seniors, veterans, children, and vulnerable communities while creating a pathway to overhaul America‚Äôs tax system that favors top income earners and corporations.   In May, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard warned that the Trump Administration‚Äôs 2018 Budget Blueprint would put the health and safety of the most vulnerable in our country at risk with massive cuts to government programs that spur economic growth and provide critical services.  ‚ÄúThe budget resolution passed in the House today puts aside the needs of the most vulnerable communities in Hawaii and across the country, in order to provide tax breaks and giveaways to huge corporations and the wealthiest 1% in the country.

This includes drastic funding cuts to long-standing and historic programs like Medicare, Medicaid, the Highway Trust Fund, Pell Grants, Head Start services, NIH research, and nutrition assistance programs, while fast-tracking oil and gas drilling in the Alaska Wildlife Nature Reserve.    ‚ÄúI cast my vote in strong opposition to this vote today, not only because it strips crucial services for hard-working Americans, but it fast-tracks a plan that will plunge the United States $1.5 trillion further into debt to pay for tax cuts that would benefit the wealthiest one percent of Americans, on the backs of an already struggling middle class.‚Äù - TG","link","http://bit.ly/2y8kGzX","bit.ly",605,68,112,71,4,12,12,32

Diwali is observed by people all around the world. Also known as Deepavali, Diwali celebrates the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness.

Diwali is observed not only as a time to spend with friends and loved ones, but also as a time to celebrate the victory of light over darkness, truth over untruth and righteousness over wrong. It is a time of spiritual renewal, and honors self-awareness, righteousness, and service to others before self‚Äîvalues that transcend different religions, backgrounds, and differences. As we gather for the beautiful Festival of Lights this year, we reflect on the opportunity each of us has to overcome our differences with one another and find ways to be of service to others.

H.R. 4328, the Honoring World War I Memorial Act of 2017 would authorize $50 million awarded through VA grants to eligible entities for the rehabilitation of World War I memorials throughout the United States. Eligible entities include non-profit organizations or state or local governments with direct jurisdiction over the rehabilitation of a World War I memorial. Hawai‚Äòi is home to one eligible World War I memorial at Waikiki Natatorium, along with 47 other states.  In recognition of Veterans Day, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard will deliver the keynote address during the Veterans' Day Ceremony in commemoration of the 99th Anniversary of the end of World War I at the Waikiki Natatorium this Saturday, November 11.  ‚ÄúMore than four million brave men and women, including 10,000 soldiers from the territory of Hawai‚Äòi, bravely served our country during World War I,‚Äù said Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. ‚ÄúNearly a century later, many of the memorials, like the WWI Waikiki Natatorium in Hawai‚Äòi, are deteriorating, decaying, and crumbling due to decades of neglect, and many have been closed to the public for decades.

As we join the world in reflecting on the centennial of the war, the Honoring World War I Memorials Act helps bring much needed focus on these memorials and ensures the sacrifices of the millions of Americans who served are not forgotten.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to have this support for our efforts of commemoration, education, and public outreach,‚Äù said Daniel Dayton, Executive Director of the WWI Centennial Commission. ‚ÄúThe American men and women who served in World War I helped to change the entire world. 4.7 million Americans stepped forward to serve in uniform during World War I. Two million of them deployed overseas. 116,516 of them never made it home. No war should be forgotten, and no military member's service should be forgotten. The lessons of their service needs to be honored, and to be learned from.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI deeply appreciate our esteemed Congressional Representative Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs commitment and diligent efforts on this admirable and long-needed legislation,‚Äù said Michelle Matson, Honolulu community advocate for the preservation, protection, and restoration of treasured historic sites and landscapes. ‚ÄúThere is great history in Hawai‚Äòi to honor our veterans who served during World War I. An ancestor, William G. Irwin, was the architect of the Kapiolani Park Trust and upon his death, his residential site was sold to the four counties of the Territory of Hawaii by his family for the purpose of the War Memorial.  A substantial boulder with a bronze plaque commemorating the citizens of the Territory of Hawai‚Äòi who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country is situated on this site today, amidst the protected green open space and with Diamond Head, a designated National Natural Landmark and State Historic Monument, as its dynamic backdrop.  This site is the park portion of the War Memorial mauka of the seawall, which was conveyed into the Kapiolani Park Trust in 1998 for public protection in perpetuity. Our country‚Äôs significant and historical memorials to our freedom are worthy of the utmost respect, protection, and restoration.‚Äù","status",NA,NA,181,22,18,23,0,0,0,2

Scott Taylor (VA-02) introduced bipartisan legislation today that will close the loophole exploited by the Sutherland Springs, Texas shooter and ensure that any individual convicted of domestic violence ‚Äì whether it is in criminal or military court ‚Äì cannot legally purchase a firearm. The Domestic Violence Loophole Closure Act would require the Department of Defense (DoD) to report any member of the Armed Forces convicted of domestic violence offenses to the NICS within three days of conviction. If the DoD fails to submit the required information then it will be required to submit to Congress a written notice on the failure to submit. A companion bill (S.2094) has been introduced by Senators Jeff Flake (AZ) and Martin Heinrich (NM).  ‚ÄúKeeping firearms out of the hands of those convicted of domestic violence is already the law of the land and must be enforced across the board. The shooting in Sutherland Springs exposed a glaring hole in Department of Defense reporting requirements that made it possible for the shooter to purchase a gun, even though a military court found him guilty of domestic violence while serving in the Air Force. Our bipartisan legislation increases transparency and mandates reporting of service members convicted of domestic violence to the FBI-administered National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which would prevent them from purchasing or owning firearms. Congress must act and pass this commonsense measure to help improve the safety of our communities."" -TG  To read more, click here: bit.ly/2AvtH3z","link","http://bit.ly/2AvtH3z","bit.ly",598,70,102,82,2,3,0,5

I voted against this legislation that increases our national deficit by over $1.4 trillion while providing huge giveaways to corporations and special interests‚Äîleaving everyone else behind.    Corporate tax cuts included in this bill were made permanent, while tax cuts for individuals last just under 10 years. Taxpayers in the top 1%‚Äîpeople making over $730,000‚Äîwould ultimately receive nearly 50% of the total tax benefit.  In a place like Hawai ªi, where families already struggle just to get by due to our high cost of living, those earning less than $55,000 per year will see little to no tax break from this bill, and would actually see their taxes increase in 10 years when the individual tax cuts expire.  As Hawai ªi moves closer to its goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2045, this bill would eliminate and phase out renewable and clean energy credits, while giving away $14 billion in federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. At a time when we need to end our dependence on fossil fuels, this is exactly the wrong direction for our country.  Nearly half of all college graduates in Hawai ªi hold some form of student debt, and with this bill, tens of thousands of students and graduates would lose their student loan interest deductions, further burying them in debt.  Deductions for major medical expenses, affecting roughly 33,000 people in Hawai ªi, would be eliminated, creating a disproportionate impact on our k≈´puna and those most vulnerable already struggling to pay for the skyrocketing cost of medical care.  Many Hawai ªi public school teachers spend hundreds of dollars of their own money every year buying school supplies for their students. This tax bill gets rid of the deduction that teachers can take for these out of pocket expenses, further driving down their take-home pay.    This bill isn‚Äôt about real tax reform‚Äîit‚Äôs a giveaway to corporations and special interests on the backs of people who are already struggling just to make ends meet.

The congresswoman answered questions from the group on getting involved in politics, working with local advocacy groups, working in a bipartisan way to deliver results, and more.  Later in the morning, the congresswoman delivered the closing address at the 2017 Hawai ªi Pacific Model United Nations (PacMUN) 6th Annual Conference at the Hawai ªi Convention Center. The conference brings together high school students from across Hawai ªi, as well as several mainland schools, for simulations of the United Nations General Assembly and other multilateral bodies.

Recent reports indicate U.S. taxpayers have paid more than $17 million to victims in 268 Congressional settlements‚Äîincluding sexual harassment, discrimination, and other cases‚Äîover the last two decades. This legislation ensures that the names of offending Members of Congress are released, and that they are held personally financially responsible for their behavior. The bill would prohibit non-disclosure agreements as a condition of initiating a complaint, and in cases where settlements are made, require the name of the employing office and the amount of the award or settlement to be published on the Office of Compliance‚Äôs (OOC) public website.  The legislation would also require mandatory training for all Members and staff, implement climate surveys providing interns and fellows the same protections as full-time staff, and end forced mediation and counseling, as well as the absurd and arbitrary wait times victims are currently forced to endure.   ‚ÄúFor too long, victims of sexual assault and harassment have been shamed and bullied into silence, perpetuating an inexcusable culture that has no place in our country. No one, whether it be a Capitol Hill staffer, Hollywood actor, schoolteacher, or soldier, or any other profession, should have to choose between their job and their personal safety, security, and privacy.

Tulsi Gabbard, Susan Davis (CA-53), Joe Wilson (SC-02), Brian Mast (FL-18), and Jacky Rosen (NV-03) today introduced bipartisan legislation to improve access to quality healthcare for disabled veterans.   The Fair Access to Insurance for Retired (FAIR) Heroes Act will allow medically retired veterans to choose between Medicare and TRICARE for their healthcare coverage. Current law requires medically retired veterans to purchase Medicare when they become eligible, and if they fail to enroll, they lose access to TRICARE coverage and face Medicare‚Äôs late enrollment penalties and restrictions. The FAIR Heroes Act will give medically retired veterans a choice to enroll in either Medicare or TRICARE, allow a one-time opportunity to switch between the programs if their current plan fails to serve their health needs, and authorizes the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide educational opportunities for veterans to make the best healthcare decision for themselves and their families.    ‚ÄúOur veterans put their lives on the line for our country. Many carry both visible and invisible wounds of war long after they lay down their uniform. Their service should never limit their access to quality healthcare and the ability to make their own decisions about their care.

In a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, Senator Chuck Schumer, Speaker Paul Ryan, and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, the lawmakers called for bipartisan legislation to extend funding for CHIP, which provides insurance coverage to nearly nine million uninsured, low-income children across the country, including over 25,000 children in Hawai‚Äòi.

After resolving the differences between the House and Senate versions of the tax reform legislation in a conference committee, H.R. 1 was passed by the House by a vote of 227-203 today, but will require a re-vote tomorrow due to technical change requirements recently discovered by the Senate.  ‚ÄúThere's no doubt the American people need and want real tax reform. But rather than passing a strong, inclusive, and bipartisan bill focused on helping hardworking middle-class families, today Republicans passed a bill filled with massive corporate giveaways and loopholes for the ultra-wealthy. For example, the top one percent in our country will receive over 82 percent of the entire tax benefit in the bill they passed today.  ‚ÄúAs long as Congress continues to pass legislation for partisan, political reasons that serve special corporate interests instead of the families that are struggling just to get by every day, where lobbyists have more input in the writing of this legislation than many Members of Congress, the American people lose.

After requiring a re-vote in the House due to technical change requirements discovered by the Senate last night, the House passed H.R. 1 again today by a vote of 224-201.  ‚ÄúThis tax bill was written by and for lobbyists and the corporations who sign their paychecks, without consideration of the lasting impact it will have on low-income and middle-class families who are struggling just to make ends meet - the reality for so many Hawai‚Äòi families and millions more nationwide. It should be no surprise that with this legislation, the top 1% in our country will receive over 82 percent of the tax benefit.  ‚ÄúWhile industry giants see the largest corporate tax cut in American history made permanent, 86 million low and middle class families will pay higher taxes in eight years than they do today.  ‚ÄúIn Hawai‚Äòi, where the average cost of a single-family home is well over $700,000, lowering the mortgage interest deduction means many local families will find it even more difficult to achieve their dreams of homeownership in our home state, as the cost of living continues to rise.   ‚ÄúAs long as Congressional leaders continue to pass legislation rushed through for partisan political reasons, where lobbyists have more input in writing this legislation than many Members of Congress, with no effort whatsoever to enact true bipartisan reform, in the end, the American people lose.
