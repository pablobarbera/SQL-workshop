In the early 1900s, the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma was home to hundreds of black-owned business, many black multi-millionaires, an envied school system, and a remarkably high employment level. This affluent neighborhood was a microcosm of the American dream and a steeple for so many communities to strive towards.   In this great country of ours, many African-Americans, and more importantly African-American men, still feel the effects of unjust policies that systematically have left them behind. The unemployment rate for black men has often sat at twice that of the national average, and stands at 7.7% currently. In an effort to address these issues I am proud to have introduced legislation, H.R. 52, Jobs, On-the-Job 'Earn While You Learn' Training, and Apprenticeships for African-American Young Men Act. This bill requires the Department of Labor to request labor unions, general contractors, and businesses that will rebuild infrastructure, transportation systems, technology and computer networks, and energy distribution systems to actively recruit, hire, and provide on-the-job training to African American men ages 18 to 39. It is a responsibility of mine to ensure that everyone in this country can take part in economic expansion and I will continue to work on behalf of all of my constituents to help those in need.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDavidScott/photos/a.150570898339.113503.113303673339/10154922466673340/?type=3",NA,8,2,1,2,0,0,0,0

In 1890, Carver enrolled in Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, where he studied Art. He later transferred to Iowa State to study agriculture, where he earned his Master‚Äôs degree by 1896. After accepting an offer from Booker T. Washington, Carver then moved to Alabama where he served as the head of the Agricultural Department at Tuskegee Institute (a historically black college, HBCU). Carver‚Äôs research at Tuskegee was innovative in improving efficiency for farmers. Carver became a figure head in agriculture and an icon for the black community.  Carver‚Äôs contributions to society can still be felt in places like our home state of Georgia. Even with Carver‚Äôs success in agriculture and at an HBCU, there is still more to be done. I am proud to be working to address these issues by introducing legislation in Congress, H.R. 51, the Funding for Student Scholarships for the 1890s Land-Grant African-American Colleges and Universities Act. This bill would establish and provide funding for a grant program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture for scholarships for students who attend historically black colleges and universities established under the Second Morrill Act of 1890. It would allow the USDA to award scholarships to students who want to attend these colleges and intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.   Our commitment to the success of our young people is always a priority in hopes for American‚Äôs bright future. I will continue to do the work necessary to ensure these possibilities.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDavidScott/photos/a.150570898339.113503.113303673339/10154951087773340/?type=3",NA,15,0,3,3,0,0,0,0

Every 98 seconds, another American falls victim to a sexual assault, yet many perpetrators walk free.  It is imperative that we protect survivors while also finding ways to prevent these despicable attacks from happening in the future. We celebrate SAAM to show that we, like many others, will speak out against sexual assault and continue to do the work to fight such devastating crimes.    In Congress I have been a longtime supporter of the Violence Against Women Act and continue to work to ensure adequate funding for programs that are successful in supporting survivors and preventing assaults.   Additionally, I have signed on to legislation such as the Pet and Women Safety Act to protect those affected by sexual assault and domestic violence who might delay their departure from dangerous relationships out of concern for the fate of their pet. Earlier this month, I signed on to a letter to request funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative to combat the high numbers of sexual assault kits not being tested.   This April, I am reaffirming my commitment to be an advocate of sexual assault awareness and prevention as I continue to serve the constituents of Georgia‚Äôs 13th Congressional District.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDavidScott/photos/a.150570898339.113503.113303673339/10155169710683340/?type=3",NA,14,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

Rather than working with Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Republicans bulldozed ahead, without waiting to find out what the consequences would be for the American people. Now, it is clear that their bill slashes $834 billion from Medicaid, a program that provides health care to some of our most vulnerable citizens; increases costs for older Americans; and risks coverage for 1.8 million Georgians under 65 who have a pre-existing condition.  After 10 years, 23 million more Americans will be uninsured under the AHCA.  And 51 million people under 65 would be uninsured in 10 years, versus 28 million under the ACA.  The CBO also estimates that, in some states, people with preexisting conditions might not be able to buy coverage ‚Äúat all‚Äù.  Out-of-pocket spending on maternity care, mental health, and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars a year for people who live in states that waive essential health benefits.  The CBO score makes plain that the Republican bill to replace and repeal Obamacare is a dangerous bill for our nation‚Äôs health care system.  That is why I am dedicated to fighting to protect the ACA; improving it, so that more Americans benefit; and opposing the Republicans‚Äô damaging health care proposal.","link","http://davidscott.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=397902","davidscott.house.gov",41,24,7,3,0,0,0,8

This law paved the way for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is so important in our efforts to reduce poverty and hunger in America. Last year, 1 out of every 6 Georgians received SNAP assistance, with over 70% helping families with children. We must continue to do everything we can to fight hunger, especially child hunger, by investing in programs like SNAP that have proven to be effective in making sure our children have the food they need to thrive in our great country.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDavidScott/photos/a.150570898339.113503.113303673339/10155655472083340/?type=3",NA,13,4,2,0,0,0,0,0
