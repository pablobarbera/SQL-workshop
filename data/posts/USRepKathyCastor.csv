TrumpCare rips insurance coverage away from millions of Americans, including at least 1.7 million in Florida who have gained coverage, and increases costs on everyone. It includes larger cuts to Alzheimer's patients, the disabled, children and families who rely on Medicaid and larger tax breaks for the wealthy. Rather than improve health care for my older neighbors and listen to our concerns, Republicans made no change to help people age 50-64 keep their coverage. In fact, premiums for our older neighbors are poised to increase by thousands of dollars so that coverage is simply out of reach.","link","http://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398373","castor.house.gov",87,23,25,0,3,2,11,26

Voters approved a constitutional amendment last November by 71% and other states have gone further. With the overwhelming and growing opioid epidemic, signs point to medical marijuana as a possible treatment for addiction, a pathway to avoid getting addicted in the first place and a cost-saver. In fact, HHS announced yesterday $485M in grants for opioid addiction including $27M for Florida.    The bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act authored by my committee and passed last year authorized these funds and boosted medical research, including Vice President Biden’s cancer “moonshot.” My discussions with local law enforcement and treatment professionals have convinced me that we need more tools in this fight. So while I'm pleased that the Cures Act provides monies to invest in treatment and prevention for opioid addiction, medical marijuana holds promise and the Trump Administration should back off their threats to block legalization and research.","link","http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/florida-getting-funds-hhs-battle-opioids","sunshinestatenews.com",50,9,12,0,1,0,0,7

He said, ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty."" President Kennedy taught us that being the leader of the free world relies less on thumping your chest and more on searching your heart and standing up for freedom. Perhaps his greatest legacy is his pragmatic and at the same time romantic belief that as Americans – even with our many differences – there is no challenge we cannot face and overcome, if we pull together.     Because of his close win in 1960, President Kennedy often reminded himself how hard he had to work and of the need to understand opposing issues in order to be the President for all in a diverse America. President Kennedy was unique and stands today as the embodiment of the Greatest Generation which stood up to doctrines of ultra-nationalism and vile racist views that were accepted in many corners. In the course of fighting these doctrines and the armies that advanced them, his generation had a clear understanding that their diversity was a strength. President Kennedy once said, that we couldn’t end our differences but, “at least we can make the world safe for diversity"".  As Americans, we must continue President Kennedy’s call – ensure our country embraces its diversity,  appreciate the strength that has always flowed from it, and continue to be a beacon for the dignity for each individual and freedom across the globe.","link","https://jfkcentennial.org/","jfkcentennial.org",50,4,9,10,0,1,0,0

One thing we know for sure is that the Affordable Care Act allowed some Americans to change jobs and start a business because discrimination for a preexisting condition was outlawed.  People who previously suffered “job-lock” – remaining in jobs out of a fear of losing health coverage – also were able to obtain health coverage through ACA marketplaces.  I have spoken with many entrepreneurs and independent workers who said the HealthCare.gov marketplace and ban on discrimination for preexisting conditions freed them up to start a business or find work on their own terms.  That will change under the House-passed bill and secret Senate bill as HealthCare.gov will be eliminated, coverage will be more expensive, and they will take us back to a time when you were locked into a job because of health insurance.  This is especially true if you are over 50 and do not qualify yet for Medicare.  There is a strong, fresh entrepreneurial spirit flowing through Tampa Bay area and I don’t want to go backward.  Health coverage shouldn’t be the overriding concern for entrepreneurs and cause them to second-guess their new idea and delay their new business.

He is unwilling to engage in the difficult work to fix and improve affordable health insurance so instead is choosing to raise premiums significantly and price people with pre-existing conditions out of the market. These measures will hurt my neighbors over the long run as affordable coverage options shrink every year, all so the President can settle a political score.

The Tampa Bay area has so many students and young families who scrape together the resources to attend college. The GOP tax plan eliminates the student loan interest deduction, which benefits more than 12 million student loan borrowers. Overall, the House GOP’s plan will cut $65 billion from higher education over the next decade. It would make greater economic sense to support affordable higher education, affordable student loan repayment initiatives and to target help to students who need it the most. The American Council on Education says: “Taken in its entirety, the House tax reform proposal released today would discourage participation in postsecondary education, make college more expensive for those who do enroll, and undermine the financial stability of public and private, two-year and four-year colleges and universities. According to the summary of the legislation provided by the House Committee on Ways and Means, this bill would increase the cost to students of attending college by more than $65 billion between 2018 and 2027. This is not in America’s national interest. We believe it is possible to offer tax relief to hard-working middle-class and lower-income Americans in a way that does not increase college costs and make a quality higher education less accessible.”","link","http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/Statement-by-ACE-President-Ted-Mitchell-on-the-House-Tax-Reform-Proposal.aspx","acenet.edu",75,40,37,2,2,10,5,24

The deduction is typically claimed when an individual or family is facing high costs from Alzheimer’s, cancer, a premature birth or other serious medical issue. AARP and the American Cancer Society Action Network strongly oppose elimination of the deduction – especially at the same time big corporations and the super rich will enjoy huge tax breaks under the GOP bill.

The #GOPTaxScam makes these problems worse, without even making the tax code simpler or fairer. Today, I urged my colleagues on the conference committee that it’s not too late to change this bad bill and step up for hardworking middle-class families rather than give them a Bah Humbug this Christmas and for their hopes for the future. The GOP is rushing this bill so the public has limited opportunity to understand and weigh in. This is NOT how democracy is supposed to work.","video","https://youtu.be/-F_t2fbClqc",NA,70,37,13,1,6,1,0,10

It is fundamentally unfair, and the GOP does this with a massive increase to our national debt of about $2.3 trillion. Their bill mortgages the future for our kids and grandkids, and squeezes out our ability to invest in medical research and modern infrastructure. To pay for it, they admit they will look to cut benefits and raise costs on families who depend on Medicaid and Medicare. In this bill, they even go so far as to rip health coverage away from 13 million Americans – another attack on affordable health care coverage.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFlmBtBBKYg&feature=youtu.be",NA,48,38,9,4,3,1,15,36

GOP leadership had appeared confident throughout Wednesday that a new strategy to pass a clean continuing resolution (CR) through Jan. 19, along with a separate disaster relief bill, would avoid an intra-party fight over the funding bill. But the strategy was quickly thrown in doubt as it became clear House GOP leadership did not have the votes to get the bill through the chamber… Meanwhile, the clock is ticking down on government funding.” Republicans in Congress reneged on their assurances to fund children’s health care and protect our DREAM Act students. It will be a shame for Congress to adjourn while these families will be left to worry through holidays about their future. Appropriations are supposed to be complete by September 30, especially when one party controls the House, Senate and White House!","link","http://thehill.com/policy/finance/365927-trouble-brewing-as-gop-struggles-with-spending-bill-votes","thehill.com",18,24,3,0,4,1,1,18
