It‚Äôs critical that, in the weeks ahead, we don‚Äôt allow them to return to the days of thinly-veiled bribes, kickbacks, and much worse; a time when an open culture of corruption ruled Washington, D.C.  The fact is we need more ethics reforms, not less. That‚Äôs why I have been fighting for all members to undergo annual ethics training. Since the creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics, disciplinary actions by the House Ethics Committee have quadrupled.  It speaks volumes that the first thing Republicans attempted to do in the new Congress was weaken ethical standards, and they only backed down once their efforts were exposed to public scrutiny.  This is not what the American people sent us here to do. After the last few hours, it‚Äôs clear that Republicans don‚Äôt want to drain the swamp ‚Äì they want to fill it up.

These actions are truly disturbing and they cannot go unanswered.   It has now been more than 200 days since we first learned of Russia‚Äôs cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee, which resulted in the theft of thousands of documents that were subsequently released through Wikileaks. Congress still has not moved to convene a bipartisan, independent commission to uncover all the relevant facts and ensure this type of attack never happens again. This is unacceptable. Russia‚Äôs hacking of our political institutions, and their efforts to tilt the scales towards Mr. Trump represent a new, unprecedented threat to our democracy that we cannot afford to ignore.   Unfortunately, some members of Congress and the President-elect himself have attempted to excuse Russia‚Äôs egregious behavior when it advances their own political goals. Vladimir Putin is not a friend to the American people ‚Äì he is a brutal dictator whose repressive values are completely contrary to our own. And in order to uphold our core American values, it is critical that President-elect Trump and his fellow Republicans stop playing politics and work to hold Russia accountable.

And repealing the Affordable Care Act will eliminate 2.6 million jobs, including 12,100 right here in Rhode Island. In addition to taking away health insurance from millions who never had it before repeal, it will raise the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and increase premiums and out-of-pocket costs for those buying insurance.  There is no question that the Affordable Care Act is working. The uninsured rate ‚Äì both in Rhode Island and across the nation ‚Äì is at its lowest level on record.

Like many of you, I worked hard to prevent Donald Trump from becoming our 45th President. When Trump's affinity for Vladimir Putin came into focus last summer, I asked President Obama to cut off his access to classified intel. I denounced his deplorable comments on women and people with disabilities, and his attack on Latinos as the hate speech that it was. And I condemned his selection of Mike Pence, a running mate with an unambiguously anti-LGBT record.   Since his election, I have refused to give a single inch to the President-elect. I led more than 160 of my colleagues demanding that he rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist. I introduced new legislation that requires him to release his tax returns so we finally know what he's hiding. And just this past weekend I condemned him for his outrageous comments about John Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement and a man who I am proud to call my friend.   I understand the frustration that people are feeling over the results of this election, and I share it. Some of my colleagues have decided the most powerful way to express their opposition to the incoming administration and the policies of the new President is to boycott the inauguration.  I have deep respect for their decision and recognize that this is one way to express strong opposition.  Others, like me, think it's an equally powerful message to attend the inauguration to make it clear that we're in this fight from the very first minute he takes office and for the next four years.   Tens of thousands of Americans and many Rhode Islanders are taking time out of their lives to travel to Washington D.C. to protest the incoming Administration on Inauguration Day, and I will be there in solidarity and in opposition to the policies and the rhetoric of Donald Trump.  And to carry on that message, on Saturday, I will join the Women's March on Washington to oppose Trump‚Äôs agenda and to commit to fight for our shared values.   Serving our state is the honor of my life. It's a responsibility that I never take lightly. And as your Representative, I promise that I will not surrender the field to Donald Trump for a single moment. He may be our 45th President, but I will be there to make sure your voice is heard loud and clear in Washington.   As President Obama reminded our nation last week, the work of democracy is always hard. Our forward progress is often uneasy and even fraught with peril.   But this is America. A nation founded on hope and the ideal that our best days still lie ahead.   I am confident that with your help, we will persevere through these challenging times once again.","status",NA,NA,329,123,37,45,0,1,0,16

I‚Äôm disappointed that President Trump did not do this today.  The remarks he offered sounded more like a campaign speech addressed to the base of his political party, rather than a speech to the entire country.  Sadly, I think President Trump squandered an opportunity to reach out to the majority of Americans who didn‚Äôt vote for him last November with a strong message that would have helped to unite our country.  Instead, he doubled down on divisive rhetoric, false bravado, and gaudy promises that have no basis in reality. The President painted an unnecessarily dark and negative picture of America. The entire world was watching this speech, and while we certainly have great challenges, America is by far the best and strongest country in the world.  Today, Donald Trump became the least popular person to ever take the oath of office as President. There is no mandate for his agenda, nor a clearer understanding of what that agenda really is, even after his address.  As I have always done, I will continue working with members of both parties to deliver results for Rhode Island. I hope President Trump will do the same.

Trumpcare was a good deal for the wealthy, a good deal for insurance companies, and a good deal for drug companies. But it was a terrible deal for working men and women across our country.  After seven years, it‚Äôs time for Donald Trump and House Republicans to give up on repealing the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare has brought the uninsured rate in Rhode Island and across the country to its lowest level on record. Premiums are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. 597,000 Rhode Islanders are now covered on employer-sponsored plans. 374,000 Rhode Islanders no longer have lifetime limits on their coverage. 465,538 Rhode Islanders can no longer denied coverage for a pre-existing condition. 8,000 young Rhode Islanders can stay on their parents‚Äô plan until they‚Äôre 26.  The Affordable Care Act is a good law, and Republicans and Democrats should be working together to make it even better. If Republicans ever decide to come to the table, we should work together to increase competition, expand coverage, and bring down premiums. That‚Äôs a decision that Republicans have to make ‚Äì whether to work with Democrats or continue down the path they‚Äôre on.  I‚Äôm thrilled that Donald Trump and the Republicans finally gave in to the will of the American people today. Just a few months ago, Republicans attempted to dismantle the Office of Congressional Ethics and were forced to back down once their efforts became public. Let‚Äôs hope they come to their senses and stop trying to ram their right-wing agenda through Congress, and instead work to advance the interests of all Americans.","status",NA,NA,241,38,19,26,0,0,0,0

It is shameful that the White House is no longer seeking to remove Bashar al-Assad from power. In fact, last fall, candidate Trump went as far as to suggest that Assad could be a useful ally in the fight against ISIS.   This pattern of looking the other way in the face of unspeakable atrocities is disgraceful. It undermines our core values as Americans. And there is little doubt that atrocities like this one will multiply if the White House continues to embolden Assad.  The Trump administration should reexamine their decision immediately. And they must work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress, as well as our international allies, to craft an appropriate response.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html","nytimes.com",176,159,116,1,0,3,110,87

Earlier this week, Assad cruelly deployed chemical weapons against civilians in his own country, including innocent children. The civilized world cannot tolerate a tyrant who does this to his own people. Assad cannot be allowed to continue in power.  Last night, President Trump launched a cruise missile strike against the Syrian military. The President must now must make clear to Congress the legal justification for these strikes, as well as a comprehensive strategy for resolving the conflict in Syria, promoting human rights, and defeating ISIS.  If the President intends to escalate our military involvement further, then Congress has a responsibility to thoroughly debate and vote on an Authorization for Use of Military Force. It is critical that the administration work with Congress in the days and weeks ahead to meet the urgency of this challenge.

That's why I led nearly 170 of my colleagues last November in asking President Trump to rescind his appointment White House Chief Strategist.  I‚Äôm happy that Steve Bannon will no longer work in the White House. But his departure cannot wash away the harm he and the President have done. It can‚Äôt reverse the Muslim Ban. It can‚Äôt reverse the President‚Äôs inappropriate attacks on a Federal judge of Mexican heritage. And it can‚Äôt reverse the White House‚Äôs reluctance to denounce white supremacists.   President Trump may want the American people to believe that he‚Äôs now serious about taking on racism. But he knows that actions speak louder than words.

But today, yet another of his top officials - HHS Secretary Tom Price - has resigned in disgrace.  Enough is enough. Republicans in Congress have given Donald Trump and his administration a blank check to do whatever they want. It‚Äôs long past time for them to work with Democrats to conduct real oversight that prevents this type of abuse. Looking the other way cannot be tolerated a single moment longer.  For his part, Secretary Price needs to repay taxpayers for the full cost of the private jets he chartered over the last few months. Partial repayments are not enough to erase the damage he has done.","status",NA,NA,191,67,15,2,1,4,2,8

The budget Republicans passed today cuts Medicare and Medicaid by nearly $1.5 trillion. It cuts mandatory transportation funding by $200 billion. It cuts funding to make college more affordable by $100 billion. And it raises taxes on the middle class. Republicans are doing all this just so they can give millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations a huge tax cut.  The wealthy have done extremely well in recent years. This budget is a great deal for them, but it‚Äôs a raw deal for working men and women.  Democrats are fighting to give working people A Better Deal. That means investing in good-paying jobs; raising wages; rebuilding our bridges, roads, and schools; lowering prescription drug costs; breaking up corporate monopolies; and expanding job training opportunities. We should be enacting a budget that promotes real economic growth and helps create good-paying jobs. This Republican budget does just the opposite.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/house-budget-blueprint-tax-cut.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news","nytimes.com",24,22,10,0,1,1,5,26

Our economy is already rigged against working people, and the bill Republicans passed today will make it even harder for middle class families to get ahead.  I voted against this bill because it raises taxes on 36 million working people, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. It cuts taxes on billionaires and corporate special interests, while creating even more incentives for corporations to ship jobs overseas. It pays for this by cutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and infrastructure funding, including $25 billion from Medicare funding in the first year alone, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. And, when it‚Äôs all said and done, it will increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next ten years, meaning the next generation will have to pick up the bill.   We need real tax reform that makes the tax code simple and fair, and helps small businesses thrive. We need a plan that cuts taxes on every middle class family. We need to close corporate loopholes that incentivize companies to ship jobs overseas. We need to support businesses that work with colleges and states to provide training for in-demand jobs here at home.  Corporations and billionaires are already doing fine. Let‚Äôs put working people first, for a change.

It is hard to understand and fully comprehend how someone who has done so much to promote equality and protect the rights of people in his professional capacity could be capable of such horrible personal actions. Sadly, this is a reality known to women across the country.  This morning, I watched Marion Brown share her story on national television. I‚Äôve reviewed the accounts of multiple other women who say they were mistreated. I believe the women who have accused Congressman John Conyers.

Disney‚Äôs proposed purchase of 21st Century Fox threatens to put control of TV, movie, and news content into the hands of a single media giant.  If it‚Äôs approved, this merger could allow Disney to limit what consumers can watch and increase their cable bills. Disney will gain more than 300 channels, 22 regional sports networks, control over Hulu, and a significant portion of Roku.  America is in a Monopoly Moment. We need more competition than before, not less, to create an economy that has more choices and innovation, lower prices, and better jobs. The House Antitrust Subcommittee should look at this proposal very closely.","link","http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-disney-fox-regulatory-concerns-20171214-story.html","latimes.com",26,17,7,0,0,4,1,6

Today‚Äôs decision by the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission ends the era of the open internet. Ending Net Neutrality will allow internet service providers to slow speeds on certain websites, charge new fees, and even block websites altogether.  I‚Äôm also deeply disturbed that the FCC went ahead with this decision after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman found that hundreds of thousands of public comments were submitted in recent weeks using stolen identities and even Russian email addresses. There‚Äôs no doubt the FCC rushed this decision and put the interests of telecom companies ahead of working people.  I‚Äôm proud to stand with millions of Americans who know that this is a bad decision. I‚Äôll continue fighting to change the law and restore Net Neutrality.","link","https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed","theverge.com",122,76,96,2,2,2,26,162
