Over the last eight years, there has been an effort to fundamentally change the way we deal with labor and employment issues. These changes have largely reduced opportunities for advancement and weakened the standing of American workers.

If you have read Meditations, you would know the writings teach the importance of humility by telling the story of leaders spending time with the warriors on the front lines. That is something General Mattis has always demonstrated throughout his service to our nation.

I was not for the United States signing it in the first place because I considered it to be a sham on the basis of two facts.    First, each nation got to pick its own goals or targets and as a result many nations targets are far below what they should be doing relative to others.  This penalizes the United States as we have ambitious targets. China, for example, will be allowed to take far longer to meet its targets than we would have been.   Second, there is no enforcement mechanism so there is no real accountability.  Nations acting in good faith like the United States would make the sacrifices and take the economic hit for doing so, while those not acting in good faith can cheat without any consequence.  Like the Iran deal, President Obama blew this negotiation, and I hope Trump forces everyone back to the table to get a better one.   I absolutely agree we must do something about our climate, but this sham of a deal, which took years to put together and cost an exhorbitant amount of money to produce, was just a way for some world leaders to pretend they were solving the issue and have an expensive self congratulatory event.","status",NA,NA,271,97,64,21,1,1,4,42

We must reject the temptation to fall into hardened political positions and instead show a united front in response to this type of racism, hatred, and bigotry. If we allow events like this to only drive us further apart, then the racists and bigots win. We, as a nation, must be - and we are - better than that. Let's stand united, avoid the petty political attacks, and make clear that these type of events should not occur in the United States of America.","status",NA,NA,123,34,13,5,0,2,0,4

That family earns a little over $77,000 a year. If that family takes the standard deduction, as most do, they will see a tax cut of $1,739.16. That comes out to almost $150 extra dollars a month. Now, that may not sound like ‚Äúreal money‚Äù in Washington, but for families in Bay Minette or Citronelle or Monroeville, that is important. That‚Äôs extra money on a car payment.
