Our nation needs a chief diplomat to advocate for what is right and stand up to President Trump when he is wrong. Unfortunately, Mr. Rex Tillerson – the President’s pick for Secretary of State – has done nothing to convince me he is that person.  Instead, Mr. Tillerson failed to criticize Russian aggression in Syria, Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. He failed to dissuade concerns about conflicts of interests. He failed to show independence from President Trump. And he failed to definitively condemn a Muslim registry, something that is absolutely unacceptable, especially in light of the President’s recent executive order. America needs someone with diplomatic experience leading the State Department, not an oil tycoon whose close ties to Russia and decades spent negotiating ExxonMobil business deals raise a number of conflict of interest issues. For all of these reasons, I voted against his nomination.","link","http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-senate-trump-cabinet-20170201-story.html","chicagotribune.com",1415,346,178,37,2,11,190,523

Without this rule, retirement advisors will be allowed to steer their clients towards more expensive funds with higher fees – robbing families saving for retirement an estimated $17 billion each year.   Stopping Wall Street investment advisors from taking advantage of consumers should be a top priority for a President who ran for office pledging to be above the influence of special interests. Instead, President Trump has stocked his administration with former Goldman Sachs employees who are eager to maintain a status quo that robs families saving for retirement of billions of dollars each year. That can mean the difference between enjoying a comfortable retirement and having to sacrifice or skimp on food, housing, health care, transportation and other necessities. The Trump administration clearly didn’t learn the right lesson from last year’s Wells Fargo scandal, but the victims did.

That is a significant oversight especially in the aftermath of the Flint Water Crisis. Lead in schools and public water supplies is a serious problem for children in Illinois and across this nation, which is why we need an EPA that will proactively prevent crises like Flint.

TSA’s counterterrorism mission is, and must always remain, the agency’s highest priority. That is why Congress should remove the arbitrary annual cap on full-time TSA screeners.

Abdulla would not have been able to enter America if a Muslim travel ban similar to President Trump’s had been in place.

We should expect nothing less than the truth from those seeking to serve the public, but we’ve now learned that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was less than forthcoming—at least twice—during his confirmation hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee that I’m honored to serve on.   When then-nominee Pruitt was asked if he used his personal email address for business or official purposes he claimed he did not. It took a court order, but we now know that he did. Administrator Pruitt also claimed during his confirmation hearing that he did not question the science behind climate change—science that 97% of scientists agree on—then turned around and told CNBC that he doesn’t believe CO2 is the primary contributor to climate change.    The American people deserve leadership in Washington that they can trust, but this President and his appointees continue to show they don’t deserve it. Unfortunately, in the case of Administrator Pruitt, dishonesty could put millions of lives throughout the country at stake. We can—and should—do much better.","link","http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html","cnbc.com",825,176,332,10,7,111,60,665

President Trump and his allies were either ready to sacrifice Veterans’ care, or they didn’t know what was in their own bill. Neither is acceptable, and we should all be relieved their attempt to force our nation's heroes to pay thousands of dollars more for health care failed.

It’s truly an honor to be speaking on the Senate floor today, at the same desk once held by President Obama. Thank you to my friend and mentor, Senator Durbin, for being here today. Though we've occasionally made choices that don't reflect our best selves, we're the greatest nation in the world due to our ideals and values. These shared values that have helped us to strive toward that more perfect union the Constitution’s framers envisioned. Falling victim to fear & demagoguery will only ensure a weaker America for our children, and that’s not a future I want for my two-year-old daughter.   America wasn’t founded as the dominant economic and military force and leader of the free world — the American people built that. From our founding, the US has faced stark divisions and challenges. But through each trial, we have emerged a more perfect union. We might get knocked down, but the America I know—that I fought for and love—does not give up. It's the American way.   Some may try to convince us the path forward is less engagement with the world, less acceptance of others and less investment in ourselves. But I know that the path forward for our country cannot include—does not include—turning our backs on the shared values that built our nation.   Progress is never a sure thing—it's won through the hard work and toil of our Servicemembers, Veterans, manufacturers, farmers, teachers and civil rights leaders. And our nation wouldn’t be as strong as it is today without the millions of individuals who sacrificed to build it. Our nation’s strength—what makes American great—is rooted firmly in our shared sense of sacrifice.   We know we still have a lot work to do as a country, but let us not lose sight of the core values that make our improbable union possible. We're still the greatest nation in the world, and if anyone has the capacity to overcome the challenges of today, it’s the American people.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenDuckworth/videos/846830485490902/",NA,1449,378,308,397,4,9,1,5
