Millions of Americans have seen their insurance plans canceled. Millions more are forced to pay double-digit increases in their premiums every year.  Despite President Obama’s promises that ‘if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor’, many Americans forced to purchase health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges were turned away by their physicians.  Today’s vote is the first step to repealing Obamacare, stopping its taxes and mandates, and returning health care decisions to patients and doctors rather than government bureaucrats. Obamacare must be replaced with market-oriented reforms that actually lowers costs, provides more options, and strengthens the patient-doctor relationship.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBobGibbs/photos/a.198559586825068.60591.191159267565100/1550463824967964/?type=3",NA,68,68,30,10,0,0,0,18

As a Christian, a father, and a grandfather, I know how precious each and every life is.  It is our responsibility to speak for and defend those who cannot speak for themselves. Since 1976, the Hyde Amendment has saved the lives of 2 million unborn children, preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to fund or provide abortions through Medicaid and other services. Unfortunately, Obamacare has circumvented the Hyde Amendment by directing taxpayer funds towards premium assistance for insurance plans that cover abortion. By expanding the Hyde Amendment’s reach and making it permanent, we can protect more lives from abortion and ensure taxpayers are in no way, directly or indirectly, financially responsible for abortion procedures.

Manufacturers like ProVia are what keeps our economy moving forward. We can't continue to place more burdens on those who create and sustain jobs for so many Americans. Too many Americans and businesses have been hit hard by the skyrocketing premiums and deductibles year after year under Obamacare. We have to repeal and replace it with a plan that actually drives down costs with increased competition in the market and that does not allow anyone to fall through the cracks, ensuring pre-existing conditions are covered, lifetime caps are removed, and that young Americans can stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 years old. The transition from Obamacare must be stable and smooth so that everyone, from patients to doctors to insurers, are prepared.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBobGibbs/photos/a.198559586825068.60591.191159267565100/1600846916596321/?type=3",NA,24,29,6,0,0,0,0,2

When the EPA wrote this flawed regulation, they ignored key comments from the Army Corps, expanded their jurisdiction against the instructions from previous court decisions, and broke the law in promoting the rule on social media. We can protect the environment, encourage economic growth, and safeguard private property rights without unnecessarily expanding federal jurisdiction and stopping the WOTUS rule is the first step in achieving those three objectives.  Last year, I urged President Trump to take action on WOTUS. Today, he is fulfilling a promise he made and making good on his pledge to reduce and reform regulations that are hurting everyday Americans. As I said yesterday, farmers in Ohio and across the nation cannot afford more costly and burdensome regulations from a Washington bureaucracy that thinks it knows best.","link","https://gibbs.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/gibbs-applauds-president-s-wotus-executive-order","gibbs.house.gov",92,37,5,8,0,0,0,12

We have an incredible opportunity to reform the way Washington works, rebuild our military, and secure our borders. Most importantly, we will work with President Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare. Millions of Americans have been hurt by Obamacare: their premiums and deductibles have skyrocketed, their plans were canceled, and their previous doctors can no longer see them.  Whether it’s regulatory relief for American businesses and non-profits, meaningful tax reform that works for American families, or increasing access to a quality education to make the American Dream possible for every child, I look forward to working with President Trump in moving our nation forward.","status",NA,NA,87,57,8,11,0,1,0,11

Below is a video to explain a few key points that shows protections for those Americans will continue.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBobGibbs/videos/1694758750538470/",NA,90,254,46,4,1,0,4,137

Today, I voted to provide relief to the millions of Americans impacted by Obamacare’s individual mandate, its taxes and penalties, and the regulations that have driven up insurance costs for so many Americans. Obamacare is collapsing and the American people are suffering because of it. We cannot afford the status quo with premiums set to skyrocket again next year and insurance companies continuing to pull out of exchanges, leaving Americans with fewer options.  This bill continues the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare with a plan that lowers costs, increases choices, and gets rid of the individual mandate.  Introducing free market principles and incentivizing the use of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) is an effective way to lower costs and return the power of healthcare decision-making to patients. This bill expands on the ability to use HSAs, continues protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, and provides support for states to create high risk pools to help low-income Americans afford health care. It also boosts funding for hospitals that have a high proportion of Medicaid and Medicare patients.  Today’s vote is one more step in the right direction but the effort to repeal Obamacare is not over. I urge the Senate to take up this legislation, debate it, and work with the House to  provide relief for Americans from Obamacare’s broken promises.","status",NA,NA,159,396,28,16,2,1,6,213

The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.  In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.  Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.  But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.  I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.  Good Luck!

Keeping America safe is our top priority. That is why we’re increasing the size of our military, making sure our troops are properly trained, and investing in maintenance of essential equipment. We ask so much of the men and women of our Armed Forces. They need support for their families and on the battlefield.  We are also implementing reforms that will help the Pentagon save money in their procurement procedures and administrative processes. This legislation increases Congressional oversight of contracts, opens up the ability for Defense officials to use commercial websites like Amazon for procurement, and eliminates redundant contracts and management systems. The American people deserve a strong military focused on its mission while also acting as good stewards of taxpayer dollars.  I am proud to support our servicemen and servicewomen with this important legislation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBobGibbs/photos/a.198559586825068.60591.191159267565100/1783239998357011/?type=3",NA,29,19,0,1,0,0,0,10

Some regulations can have a major economic impact, and the total cost of federal regulations cost the economy nearly $2 trillion in 2012 according to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers.

He flew over 35 combat missions, with over 280 combat flight hours in the European Theater. He was assigned to the Army Air Corps’ 337th Bombardment Squadron, of the 96th Bombardment Group. His plane was hit by 20mm shells on December 31st, 1944 while flying over Germany. As a result, the plane broke formation and became a lone target. Reese repelled enemy attacks from his tail gunner position and the B-17 was able to make an emergency landing. While several crew members were wounded, no lives were lost thanks in part to his efforts.  Last week, Sergeant Reese was awarded the French Legion of Honor by the Consul General of France, Guillaume Lacroix. The Legion of Honor is the highest award given by the French Government and was started in 1802 by Napoleon. My office was proud to recognize Sergeant Reese’s award with proclamation from my office.
