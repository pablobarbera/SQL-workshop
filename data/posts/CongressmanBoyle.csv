Republicans claim they want to ‘drain the swamp,’ but late last night (the night before the new Congress gets sworn in) the House GOP eviscerated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions.     The Office of Congressional Ethics provides a non-partisan ethics process in the House.  This new amendment Republicans approved last night would essentially destroy that office.   Congress must hold itself to the highest standards of conduct.  But, instead of seeking those high standards, the House Republicans Conference has acted to weaken ethics and silence would-be whistleblowers.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/02/politics/office-of-congressional-ethics-oversight-of-ethics-committee-amendment/index.html","cnn.com",71,34,33,0,0,4,2,21

Key statistics from the report:   • Pennsylvania would have the 4th highest job losses among the states in 2019 (137,000 jobs lost).  • About 2.6 million jobs could be lost nationwide in 2019, rising to almost 3 million by 2021. Every state would experience major job losses.  • Almost all of the jobs lost are in the private sector. Almost a million (912,000) are in health care, while the remaining two-thirds are in other industries, including construction, real estate, retail trade, finance and insurance.  • Gross state products (state-level analogues to the gross domestic product for the nation) could decline by $256 billion in 2019. Total business output would fall by almost half a trillion dollars ($441 billion) in 2019. Over five years, from 2019 to 2023, gross state products could fall by $1.5 trillion and total business output could be cut by $2.6 trillion.   • These losses could also trigger reductions in state and local tax revenues, amounting to about $48 billion lost over five years. States and local governments will experience these revenue shortages at the same time that they face a greater need for uncompensated care and other services because millions more will be uninsured.  • Repealing premium tax credits, by itself, would be responsible for the loss of about million jobs in 2019. The repeal of Medicaid expansion alone would reduce employment by 1.5 million.  All the states will experience negative economic effects if Medicaid expansions are revoked, even the 19 states that have not expanded. Workers and businesses located in Medicaid expansion states purchase goods and services from nonexpanding states, so the negative effects of cancelling Medicaid expansions ripple out to all state.    https://publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/HPM/Repealing_Federal_Health_Reform.pdf","status",NA,NA,32,9,20,0,0,1,5,15

Marc Veasey and me on the withdrawal of President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Labor, Andy Puzder:  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressmen Brendan F. Boyle (PA-13) and Marc Veasey (TX-33), co-chairs of the Blue Collar Caucus, released the following statement regarding the withdrawal of President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, Andy Puzder:  “Andy Puzder was a profoundly unfit choice to run the Department of Labor. He is the living example of the fox guarding the hen house, and we applaud him for withdrawing his name from consideration.  Puzder is a man who has made millions of dollars on the backs of underpaid, overworked, and exploited workers. He has kept his employees dependent on public assistance programs meant for those in the depths of poverty by denying them fair pay and benefits.    Pudzer is a serial offender of minimum wage, overtime, wage theft, and even child labor laws. Given this track record, he absolutely could not have been trusted to expand opportunities, protect the livelihoods of all workers, or ensure that workplaces are safe, humane, and just for employees nationwide.  Less than a month after his inauguration, it’s clear that President Trump has already discarded his promise to represent the 'forgotten men and women' of our nation. Puzder would have kept them forgotten, as well as forsaken, because he would have proudly had those workers replaced by robots who don’t have rights, safety, or dignity to protect.  Our Blue Collar Caucus, a group of House Democrats committed to fighting for working class Americans in Congress and holding Mr. Trump accountable for his many campaign promises, vows to carefully oversee this Administration’s actions. The Secretary of Labor should not be fundamentally opposed to the mission of the Department he is charged to lead. Mr. Pudzer was a dangerous choice for the future of hardworking Americans, and we won’t expect better from the next nominee.” ###  Current Members of the Blue Collar Caucus include: Brendan Boyle (PA-13) (Co-Chair), Marc Veasey (TX-33) (Co-Chair), Debbie Dingell (MI-12), Rick Nolan (MN-08), Dan Kildee (MI-05), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Tim Ryan (OH-13), John Garamendi (CA-03), Louise Slaughter (NY-25), Matt Cartwright (PA-17), Bill Pascrell (NJ-09), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ruben Gallego (AZ-07), Dan Lipinski (IL-03), Kathy Castor (FL-14), Brian Higgins (NY-26), John Yarmuth (KY-03), Eric Swawell (CA-15), Joe Courtney (CT-02), Alan Lowenthal (CA-47), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), Dina Titus (NV-01), Paul Tonko (NY-20), John Larson (CT-01), Chellie Pingree (ME-01), Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Luis Gutierrez (IL-04), Cheri Bustos (IL-17), J.

Equal Pay Day symbolizes when, more than three months into the year, women’s wages finally catch up to what men were paid in the previous year.  It has been 54 years since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, and yet women still earn on average only 80 cents for every dollar earned by men.   On June 10, 1963, President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, which established the principle of equal pay for equal work for women in the workforce.  In 1963, women on average made 59 cents for every dollar earned by men.  Today, women on average make 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, amounting to a yearly gap of $10,470 between full-time working men and women.  This is progress – but not nearly enough progress.   Pay inequity not only affects women – it affects children and families and our economy as a whole.  That is because women in this country are the sole or co-breadwinner in two thirds of families with children.  Families increasingly rely on women’s wages to help make ends meet, and with less take-home pay women have less for the everyday needs of their families – groceries, rent, child care, doctors’ visits. #EqualPayDay #EqualPay","link","http://fortune.com/2017/04/03/equal-pay-day-2017-wage-gap/","fortune.com",20,6,5,2,0,2,4,0

Montco SAAC’s Meals on Wheels operation is the largest in Montgomery County. Its existence is now threatened by President Trump’s proposed budget cuts that could eliminate critical funding that allows Montco SAAC Meals on Wheels to feed more than 350 homebound seniors every day.  The President’s proposed budget would eliminate the Community Development Block Grant, which funds a large part of Meals on Wheels. If enacted, the President would literally be taking food away from seniors. This is wrong. The President's proposed budget only adds to the challenges for struggling seniors trying to survive on a fixed income. We must provide them with the means to live independenly and with dignity.

With this step, and yesterday’s executive action to erode the ACA’s consumer protections for those with pre-existing conditions, it is clear that President Trump is now actively undermining Americans’ access to healthcare for his own political gain. Ending these subsidies will cause premiums to spike 20% in the next year and serve as a wrecking ball to basic healthcare access in our nation, and to the incredible progress in coverage that we’ve seen over the past eight years thanks to the ACA.

The current version of the Republican tax reform plan would eliminate a key tax deduction for those paying off their student loans with interest. Over 12 million Americans rely on this tax deduction – eliminating it to help pay for massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations is simply unconscionable.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanBoyle/photos/a.1509990045978521.1073741830.1509857819325077/1839767026334153/?type=3",NA,179,23,17,8,0,3,4,3

The student debt crisis threatens the most essential promise of our nation:  if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. So many young people struggling with student loan debt have followed a path that used to spell success in this country – studying hard in school, getting a college education, and taking the first steps to building a career.    Now, rather than ease that burden, the Republican tax plan would punish those with student debt even further by eliminating the tax deduction for interest accruing on student loans – pouring salt in the wound.  Rather than eliminate it, we should expand the tax deduction for those working hard to pay off their student debt.  We should allow folks to refinance their student loans at lower interest rates, to make their debt more manageable. Or better yet, offer interest-free federal loans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanBoyle/photos/a.1509990045978521.1073741830.1509857819325077/1840085942968928/?type=3",NA,105,9,3,4,0,3,0,0

Jeff is part of the Wounded Warrior Program that was established to create employment opportunities for veterans within the House of Representatives. He served 5 years in the United States Army and 3 years in the United States Army Reserve. While on active duty, he was stationed on bases in Germany, Louisiana and York, PA.  He was also deployed to Iraq for multiple tours.  Jeff grew up in Buffalo, New York, but now calls Towamencin, PA home where he lives with his wife and child.  Jeff says that he enjoys working in a Congressional Office. In particular, he said he enjoys helping people understand the military and the VA. Jeff says that his biggest reward is when he is able to procure critical documents for family members of military vets that need them.  In his short time in our office, he has been able to obtain multiple military medals—including a Purple Heart for the daughter of a deceased WW2 Veteran.

Senate Republicans are celebrating their passage of a partisan bill that steamrolls the middle class and decimates healthcare accessibility nationwide, all in order to furnish a massive giveaway to the richest of the rich. It’s a disgrace.   This was an opportunity for Congress to accomplish something together for the American people; close corporate loopholes, invest in infrastructure, and provide real relief for working families who haven’t had a pay raise in years. Instead, in the dead of the night Republicans rammed through a bill that overwhelmingly benefits corporations and the super wealthy, rewards outsourcers, and explodes the national deficit – leaving trillions in debt for our children and grandchildren to shoulder and automatically triggering cuts to Medicare and education  programs. As a Member of the House Budget Committee and co-chair of the Blue Collar Caucus, I will continue to do everything in my power to defeat this legislation in the House and instead fight for real economic solutions that benefit the middle class.","link","http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/362891-senate-passes-tax-overhaul-securing-major-victory","thehill.com",81,78,32,0,1,1,33,114

That means that, under the bill, states with strong concealed carry laws are forced to honor concealed carry permits from states with very weak laws.   The bill does not create a national standard across states for who is eligible for a concealed carry permit.  Instead, it gives the weakest state laws the furthest reach and would simply override many state concealed carry laws.  It would force each state to recognize standards from all other states – even if a person would otherwise not be allowed to possess a gun in that state.    We need sensible gun violence legislation.
