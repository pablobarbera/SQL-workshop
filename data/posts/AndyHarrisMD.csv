The Executive Order temporarily suspends visas issued to individuals from seven specific countries prone to terrorism – similar to President Obama’s temporary ban on visas for refugees from Iraq in 2011 for the same reason.    The vetting of individuals seeking to immigrate into the United States from countries where ISIS has a significant presence must be increased to better protect Americans’ safety and our national security. As President Trump noted, the seven countries are the same countries previously identified by the Obama Administration as sources of terror. I also applaud the decision to prioritize entry of those refugees who are religious minorities fleeing religious persecution, whether those minorities are Muslims, Yazidis, Zoroastrians, or Christians.  The United States should resume issuing visas to all these countries only after a review of these policies is completed, and only if the countries comply with supplying the information necessary to allow complete vetting.","status",NA,NA,533,560,126,49,0,3,19,271

The federal government currently provides around $38 billion in grants each year to universities for research and development. Approximately 23% of those funds go to overhead or indirect costs associated with research and development activities, with some institutions receiving hundreds of millions of dollars each year. By withholding reimbursement for “indirect” or overhead costs associated with research and development grants from any institution of higher learning that does not comply with federal immigration law, this legislation will end sanctuary campus policies nationwide. The aim of my bill is to hold these institutions accountable without penalizing students. By withholding only reimbursement for indirect research costs, American students will still have access to financial aid, Pell grants, and direct research funding.","status",NA,NA,145,293,57,25,0,0,7,202

For too long, Americans have seen their premiums skyrocketing, their deductibles soaring, and their choices dwindling.  The Obamacare path is unsustainable and dangerous for our country.   Fixing this mess will not be easy, but this week the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was introduced to replace the failing Obamacare system. AHCA will drive down costs while providing every American with access to high quality, affordable health insurance.    AHCA does away with Washington bureaucratic mandates, choosing instead to empower patients and their physicians in health care decision-making. AHCA restores control of Medicaid decisions to the states, helping us to reduce fraud and abuse while promoting flexibility.  AHCA accomplishes all of this while maintaining protections for patients with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance.

Andy Harris, M.D.","2017-05-04","2017-05-04 18:41:32","The Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) has resulted in skyrocketing health insurance prices, a diminishing choice of providers, and in some areas a dwindling to no choice of health insurance plans.  That is why I voted in favor of legislation that will immediately lower premiums and begin to fix our broken health insurance system.  Unfortunately, there has been significant misinformation about this bill.  So I want to be clear that the AHCA explicitly maintains, and even adds, protections for pre-existing conditions.  The bill makes clear that under no circumstance can people be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.  Guaranteed issue of coverage, guaranteed renewability of coverage, and the prohibition on insurance companies denying coverage due to a pre-existing condition are all maintained.  The bill does not change Medicare benefits or impact the Medicare drug benefit.    The bill will permit states a limited waiver for using health status to adjust costs for some customers if, and only if, a high risk pool, risk sharing, or reinsurance mechanism is instituted to ensure affordable coverage.  This is exactly what Maryland did prior to the ACA through the Maryland Health Insurance Program – a program that successfully ensured affordable coverage and benefits for people with medical conditions, while lowering premium costs in the regular health insurance market.  This week, the Maryland Insurance Administration announced that the state’s largest Obamacare insurer is seeking a 53-62% increase to premiums for their silver level health insurance plan—the state’s most popular insurance plan.  Since 2014, Marylanders have seen unsustainable and skyrocketing premiums, and some rates will have more than tripled.  As Obamacare fails, insurers are leaving the market, and consumers are left with few options for affordable coverage.  On the Eastern Shore, there are currently only two insurance options available, and there is no HMO insurance plan available.  I voted in favor of the American Health Care Act today to strengthen health insurance coverage for every person in Maryland’s First Congressional District, while lowering their health insurance costs.","status",NA,NA,347,1110,215,38,5,0,11,605
