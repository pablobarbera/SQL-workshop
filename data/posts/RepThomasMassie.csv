Massie Introduces Bill to Abolish Federal Department of Education   WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representative Thomas Massie introduced H.R. 899, a bill to abolish the federal Department of Education. The bill, which is one sentence long, states, “The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018.”   On the day of Betsy DeVos’ scheduled Senate confirmation for Secretary of Education, Massie said, “Neither Congress nor the President, through his appointees, has the constitutional authority to dictate how and what our children must learn.""  Massie added, ""Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children’s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school.""  “For years, I have advocated returning education policy to where it belongs - the state and local level,” said Rep. Walter Jones, an original co-sponsor.  “D.C. bureaucrats cannot begin to understand the needs of schools and its students on an individual basis. It is time that we get the feds out of the classroom, and terminate the Department of Education.”  The Department of Education began operating in 1980. On September 24, 1981 in his Address to the Nation on the Program for Economic Recovery, President Ronald Reagan said, “As a third step, we propose to dismantle two Cabinet Departments, Energy and Education. Both Secretaries are wholly in accord with this. Some of the activities in both of these departments will, of course, be continued either independently or in other areas of government. There's only one way to shrink the size and cost of big government, and that is by eliminating agencies that are not needed and are getting in the way of a solution. Now, we don't need an Energy Department to solve our basic energy problem. As long as we let the forces of the marketplace work without undue interference, the ingenuity of consumers, business, producers, and inventors will do that for us. Similarly, education is the principal responsibility of local school systems, teachers, parents, citizen boards, and State governments. By eliminating the Department of Education less than 2 years after it was created, we cannot only reduce the budget but ensure that local needs and preferences, rather than the wishes of Washington, determine the education of our children.”  Original co-sponsors include Congressman Justin Amash (R-MI),  Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Congressman Jody Hice (R-GA), Congressman Walter Jones (R-NC), and Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-ID).   #EndFedEd","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepThomasMassie/photos/a.536112449746257.122574.452480994776070/1483967511627408/?type=3",NA,4849,1371,5903,1066,17,46,11,319

Some will wait until April 18th to file.  In any case, I don't know anyone who enjoys dealing with income taxes or thinks the current tax code is fair.  That's one reason I have cosponsored the Fair Tax (H.R.25), which repeals the income tax and abolishes the IRS.   Here's a summary of the bill.  If you agree, please share this post.  If not, please leave a comment other than, or in addition to, #taxationistheft.  Fun fact: Vice President Pence supported this bill when he was in Congress (2009).  FairTax Act of 2017 (summary):  This bill is a tax reform proposal that imposes a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services in lieu of the current income and corporate income tax, employment and self-employment taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The rate of the sales tax will be 23% in 2019, with adjustments to the rate in subsequent years. There are exemptions from the tax for used and intangible property, for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes, and for state government functions.  Under the bill, family members who are lawful U.S. residents receive a monthly sales tax rebate (Family Consumption Allowance) based upon criteria related to family size and poverty guidelines.  The states have the responsibility for administering, collecting, and remitting the sales tax to the Treasury.  Tax revenues are to be allocated among: (1) the general revenue, (2) the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund, (3) the disability insurance trust fund, (4) the hospital insurance trust fund, and (5) the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund.  No funding is authorized for the operations of the Internal Revenue Service after FY2021.  Finally, the bill terminates the national sales tax if the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution (authorizing an income tax) is not repealed within seven years after the enactment of this bill.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepThomasMassie/photos/a.536112449746257.122574.452480994776070/1496556233701869/?type=3",NA,1369,303,702,183,4,7,1,17

It does not authorize the federal government to restrict contracts between individuals who agree to share information (whether by implicit or explicit consent). Even so, some would like the federal government to be involved in private internet service contracts to protect one party from the other.   It is my observation that the free market is currently responding to consumer demand for privacy without FCC intervention.  The Obama Administration’s rule that is before Congress today did not exist until five months ago, yet abuse of customer data was not prevalent before the rule. Likewise, this FCC rule has never applied to search engines or social media platforms, yet harmful use of customer information has not been prevalent.  In fact, many Internet Service Providers already voluntarily include opt-in clauses in their privacy policies. To summarize, exploiting a customer’s privacy in a way the customer resents is bad for business.  I understand and appreciate the concerns of those who have contacted me in favor of the FCC rule. I share concerns for privacy and have always been an adamant defender of the Fourth Amendment. I see some benefit from the rule. On the balance though, I feel that letting the Federal government regulate Internet activity is more harmful than the good that results from voluntary exchanges between parties in the free market.","status",NA,NA,560,139,130,31,1,1,0,26

Prohibition on funds to escalate United States military involvement in Syria (a) In general No funds made available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of, or in a manner which would have the effect of, supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Syria by any nation, group, organization, movement, or individual.

If another country attacked one of our military bases we would consider it an act of war.  This was an act of war against Syria, and according to the Constitution, only Congress can declare war.  However, the President did not seek Congressional authorization.  For those who say the 1973 War Powers Resolution allows the President to use military force, please realize it only allows a President to use military force in three circumstances:  1) Congressional Authorization 2) A Congressional Declaration of War 3) A national emergency created by an attack on the U.S., on a U.S. territory, or against our troops.  In my opinion, none of these criteria were met. I believe it is time for the GOP House leadership to bring this debate to Congress, instead of abdicating our responsibility to the Executive branch.

The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is “founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.”  During our discussion, I explained how the appropriations process is supposed to work under ""regular order"" and how next week we should unfortunately expect to see an omnibus spending bill that results in one all or nothing vote to fund the entire federal government.   We also discussed the recent Syrian attack. I shared with them several quotes by President James Madison which helped further explain my position, and our founders position, on this issue.   ""In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department.""

Massie Votes Against Omnibus Continuing Resolution   WASHINGTON, D.C- America’s national debt is nearing $20 trillion, yet today Congress passed a $1.163 trillion omnibus spending bill (H.R. 244). This legislation exceeds congressional spending caps by over $90 billion and contains full funding for the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood.  Congressman Massie voted against H.R 244- the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2017  “House Leadership and the media have led the public to believe that passing one giant omnibus every year, at the last minute, is a legitimate way to fund the government and that anything else will result in a total government shutdown. Both are false,” Congressman Massie explained. “We should write, debate, amend, and pass 12 separate appropriations bills as the law prescribes, so that if any one bill fails to pass, only 1/12th of the Federal government shuts down.”  H.R 244 passed the House of Representatives 309-118, with 178 Democrats and 131 Republicans voting in favor.","status",NA,NA,1022,146,256,64,2,9,10,66

Today, however, the House voted for a healthcare bill that makes these objectionable measures permanent.   The former Democrat Speaker of the House was rightfully derided for imploring Members to vote for a healthcare bill to “find out what was in it.”  Yet today, we voted on a healthcare bill for which the text was available only a few hours before the vote.  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office had no time to even provide Congress with a preliminary estimate of the full cost of this bill.    By repealing a small number of Obamacare mandates, while leaving others in place, this bill runs the risk of destroying what remains of the individual health insurance market.  The option in this bill that allows States to apply for waivers from some Obamacare mandates is well-intentioned.  However, it falls far short of our promise to repeal Obamacare.  There also remains the risk that State legislatures, like our federal legislature, are unable to withstand the political pressure from lobbyists who defend Obamacare, and the pressure from those who receive Obamacare’s welfare handouts.    This bill should have included measures that allow Americans to take charge of their own healthcare and get the government out of the way.  These measures include allowing the deduction of health insurance costs from income taxes, giving everyone the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, and allowing individuals to band together through any organization to purchase insurance.   In weighing my vote, I heeded the wise advice that “one should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” If this bill becomes law, it could result in worse outcomes, fewer options, and higher prices for Kentuckians who seek health care. In summary, I voted against this bill not because it’s imperfect, but because it’s not good.","status",NA,NA,2744,495,1669,205,5,7,38,193

Last year, I had the opportunity to question former FBI Director Comey about the Bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server and her reckless treatment of classified information. During our exchange, Director Comey admitted that Clinton was not being prosecuted because she did not appear to have the “intent” to mishandle classified information- even though the criminal statute does not require intent. I later asked him if the FBI was investigating the person down the e-mail chain who had purposefully recreated classified information on an unclassified device, to which he said “no”.  At the time, I thought Director Comey was overstepping his bounds by judging that law was not worth enforcing.

The Justice Safety Valve Act would give federal judges the ability to impose sentences below mandatory minimums in appropriate cases based upon mitigating factors.  The one-size-fits-all approach of federally mandated minimums does not give judges the latitude they need to ensure that punishments fit the crimes. As a result, nonviolent offenders are sometimes given excessive sentences. Furthermore, public safety can be compromised because violent offenders are released from our nation's overcrowded prisons to make room for nonviolent offenders. #JSVA #CJReform","link","http://wfpl.org/rand-paul-re-introduces-bill-to-ease-mandatory-minimums/","fpl.org",1477,114,331,117,1,0,0,11

Currently probation officers can only arrest people on probation without a warrant.  This bill allows them to arrest others without a warrant.  FreedomWorks opposes this bill and so do I.  Here is their statement:  Although the bill may have good intentions, it presents a serious conflict with the Fourth Amendment and expands the policing powers of federal probation officers.  While there is a need to protect law enforcement officers who are performing their duties, the Probation Officer Protection Act is an answer in search of a problem. Interference with a federal probation officer is already unlawful and current law already allows a law enforcement officer to arrest an individual or individuals who obstruct a federal probation officer during the performance of their duties.  The instances in which third parties obstruct a federal probation officer are rare. According to the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System, less than 4 percent of third parties were uncooperative during pre-approved searches in 2013, less than 6 percent in 2014, and 7 percent in 2016. Separately, the Federal Probation and Pretrial Officers Association reported that only 3 percent of searches in 2016 involved uncooperative third parties. While probationers have lost some of their Fourth Amendment rights, third parties have not. The Probation Officer Protection Act could lead to instances in which the Fourth Amendments rights of third parties are infringed because of overly broad language in Section 2(b) or interpretations of words in it, such as “intimidation” or “interference.”  Additionally, the “rules and regulations” under which the arrest authority of federal probation officers will be determined by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, not by Congress. This creates yet another situation in which Congress is relenting its constitutional authority to another branch of the federal government.  You can find the text of the bill here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1039/text","status",NA,NA,682,92,233,22,0,13,6,77

That’s why today, I re-introduced the Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act (H.R. 2552). This bill eliminates an unfair double-tax on seniors’ Social Security retirement benefits.  Although seniors have already paid tax on their Social Security contributions via the payroll tax, they are still required to list these benefits as taxable income on their tax returns. This is simply a way for Congress to obtain more revenue for the federal government at the expense of seniors who have already paid into Social Security. My bill would exempt Social Security retirement benefits from taxation and boost the retirement income of millions of older Americans.  As the Congressional Research Service reports, “Until 1984, Social Security benefits were exempt from the federal income tax. The exclusion was based on rulings made in 1938 and 1941 by the Department of the Treasury and Bureau of Internal Revenue (the predecessor of the Internal Revenue Service). The 1941 Bureau ruling…viewed benefits as being for general welfare and reasoned that subjecting the payments to income taxation would be contrary to the purposes of Social Security.” In other words, the 1941 equivalent of the IRS viewed taxation of Social Security benefits as being unjust and contrary to the purpose for which Social Security was created.  It is time to end this accounting sleight of hand and restore integrity to the #SocialSecurity program.","link","https://massie.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rep-massie-re-introduces-the-senior-citizens-tax-elimination-act","massie.house.gov",4105,431,2352,475,3,21,1,5

The #PRIME (Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption) Act would give individual states freedom to permit intrastate distribution of custom-slaughtered meat such as beef, pork, or lamb, to consumers, restaurants, hotels, boarding houses, and grocery stores.   As a producer of grass-fed beef, I am familiar with the difficulties small producers face when marketing directly to consumers. Despite consumers’ desire to know where their food comes from, federal inspection requirements make it difficult for them to purchase food from local farmers they know and trust. These onerous federal rules also make it more difficult for small farms and ranches to succeed financially. It is time to open our markets to small farms and producers and give consumers the freedom to choose.

Sadly, over 8,000 veterans commit suicide every year.   In 2007, the Veterans Crisis Hotline was established (1-800-273-8255) and since then, has answered nearly 2.8 million calls and dispatched emergency services nearly 74,000 times. President Trump announced last week that they are setting up a Veterans Complaint Hotline in the White House for all veterans (855-948-2311). These resources are an invaluable tool to protect the well being of our nations heroes.   We have to ask ourselves- why is this issue more prevalent now than ever?   It may have something to do with our engagement in the longest overseas war in our history, Afghanistan, and the changing nature of our enemy.   I am concerned that Washington has continued engaging in wars without defining the goals or what winning would actually look like. In fact, 80% of the current members of congress have not taken a vote on whether or not we should be at war in Afghanistan. That is irresponsible and unacceptable, which is why I have been working with Congressman Jones to try and force this debate.   The decision to commit our troops to war is one of the most important acts of Congress. I will never take this decision lightly.   During my speech, I discussed legislation i've supported to help veterans, such as the bill to allow veterans to get a physical at a VA facility for their Commercial Drivers License(CDL).   I also explained how the Murray/Ryan balanced budgets agreement in 2013, which I voted against, originally cut veterans benefits. Thankfully, public resistance was able to get that provision rolled back.   This event was also a memorial for Matthew Winkler, a Covington veteran who committed suicide last year. His mother Deb has been championing veterans suicide awareness ever since his passing, and her courage has been awe-inspiring.   Thank you to Mayor Joe Meyer, Deb Winkler, Howard Berry and everyone involved in today's program for inviting me to speak about this important issue.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepThomasMassie/photos/a.931648290192669.1073741980.452480994776070/1618636554827169/?type=3",NA,258,30,55,15,0,1,36,0

The right to keep and bear arms is the common person's first line of defense in these situations, and it should never be denied.  http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/14/john-lott-scalise-shooting-and-knee-jerk-calls-for-more-gun-control-here-go-again.html","link","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/14/john-lott-scalise-shooting-and-knee-jerk-calls-for-more-gun-control-here-go-again.html","foxnews.com",1191,119,217,118,0,2,6,25

The hand wringing has commenced over how to fund our nation's infrastructure, the military, improved border security, and entitlements.    Money is supposedly so tight that even Republicans are proposing new taxes to offset proposed tax cuts.  In just a few weeks, the cry for raising the debt limit will become deafening.  Creative accounting is being invoked to circumvent reasonable budget caps that most  Republicans and Democrats voted for 7 years ago (and President Obama signed).  Yet only a few true conservatives in Congress (like Justin Amash, Walter Jones, and Raul Labrador) have pointed out that $43 billion will be spent in the 17th year of our war in Afghanistan!    To put $43 billion in perspective, that's the equal to the amount of money that the federal government will spend on all roads and bridges this year.  It's roughly 10% of our federal deficit this year.  It's also the proposed increase in defense spending that many in congress say is required to keep our military strong.  Do you support spending $43 billion on a war in Afghanistan this year?  I do not.

The Department of Transportation had implemented regulations that required physical exams for CDLs to be conducted only by medical professionals on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (NRCME). Unfortunately, only a fraction of otherwise qualified physicians have completed the costly and time-consuming certification process. The VA employs just eleven physicians nationally that are listed on the NRCME.  Yesterday, the House passed H.R.2547 –the Veterans Expanded Trucking Opportunities Act of 2017. This legislation would expand U.S. military veterans’ ability to get a physical at a VA facility for their CDL.  The trucking industry has long been a source of employment for veterans and their families, but recent regulations make it difficult for them to receive the CDL required for the job.  I was one of only 4 sponsors to support this bill, but I am thankful it passed the House unanimously.   One of my priorities is to make it easier for veterans to succeed after serving our country. This provision, while small, offers a simple fix that will help some veterans during their transition to the private sector.

So the next generation will be better off because of inventors as long as politicians don’t screw it up.”  “There is a certain critical size companies reach before they hire lobbyists, which means only the big companies are represented on Capitol Hill,”   “They are here in Congress looking to weaken patents and they are not just interested in weakening patents issued in the future, they are looking to weaken all patents.”  “Patents help the little guy, whether you are a one person company or a company with 10,000 employees, you have the same rights.

Thomas Massie (R-KY), who spoke in advance of the panel regarding H.R. 2997.  “The best description of what we’re doing is not really privatization in the sense that you turn [ATC] over to a free market and a bunch of companies compete. It’s more like a user-managed cooperative or user-managed utility,” Massie explained during the July 18 event.  Massie has been at the forefront of introducing pro-market reforms in Congress, Sargent said. Along with U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Massie on March 1 introduced the Investing in America: Rebuilding America’s Airport Infrastructure Act, H.R. 1265.  H.R. 1265 would be “an exciting tweak” to add to H.R. 2997, but Massie said that hasn’t happened yet. “But I would like to see it happen,” he said. “Maybe in the Senate we can try to do something.” Currently, the bill is being reviewed by the House aviation subcommittee.

We discussed the Industrial Hemp Farming Act (H.R. 3530) that we recently introduced with Congressman Comer as the lead sponsor. This crop never should have been banned in our country. We are working to remove all restrictions so it can be grown commercially again here in the U.S.  I also described the #PRIME (Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption) Act, and how it would give individual states freedom to permit intrastate distribution of custom-slaughtered meat such as beef, pork, or lamb, to consumers, restaurants, hotels, boarding houses, and grocery stores.  I explained some of the issues Congress will be debating in the coming months. In September, Congress will decide on a debt ceiling hike and will likely vote on an omnibus bill. As a proponent of getting back to ""regular order,"" I am disappointed that Republican leadership continues on the irresponsible path of using one bill to fund the government.

The mission of the Whitney Young Job Corp is to teach young people the skills they need to become employable and independent and place them in meaningful jobs or further education.  During the tour, I met with some of the construction trade students who are building a curb for the sidewalks on campus. I also toured their welding, carpentry, pharmacy tech, medical and nursing assistant facilities.   Some of the students who are a part of this program ""shadow” others, where students try out various trades to determine which they prefer and want to study. This helps ensure that students can study what they are interested in, and are therefore more likely to succeed.   An important aspect of the Whitney Young Job Corp is that all students have to have a certificate in a trade in order to graduate; though I am honored that they awarded me an honorary high school diploma!  I celebrated by ringing the bell, as does every student who earns their diploma here.  Thank you to the staff of Whitney Young Job Corps for providing this opportunity and to the students for taking time to speak with me about their trade and experience!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepThomasMassie/photos/a.536112449746257.122574.452480994776070/1726110357413121/?type=3",NA,195,25,16,14,0,0,0,0

Think again!  The debt jumped over $300 billion dollars in one day because the treasury refueled the spare tanks that it had been running on for about 6 months.  (Spare tanks include pension funds for federal employees... which the Treasury had spent.)  So what does this mean?  It means that a ""3 month debt limit extension"" will allow the government to operate in the red for about another 9 months, because Treasury can spend the federal pensions and other trust funds again.  It's disingenuous to tie a $15 billion disaster relief package to a $300 billion debt limit increase.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission.  Our brief argues that government coercion of speech or conduct that violates an individual’s religious conscience is not only ‘a violation of the First Amendment, but also un-American and a gross violation of personal liberty.’     Jack Phillips is the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, a family business he opened 23 years ago.  In July of 2012, he declined a request to decorate a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony, citing his Christian beliefs.  Notably, Mr. Phillips never declined service to anyone and even offered to sell the couple an undecorated, pre-made cake.  Following this incident, Mr. Phillips and his staff were sued, ordered to enter a “re-education” program, and informed that they must file “compliance” reports with the government.   Mr. Phillips decided to defend himself in court, and the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear his case.  Oral arguments will be heard this Fall.  Please share if you agree with Mr. Phillips and me that the government has no right to force any individual to violate his conscience or religious beliefs.

It is instrumental in teaching and fostering the values that are critical to create the next generation of leaders.  To complete his first program area, Voluntary Public Service, Sam frequently volunteered at the gift shop of the St. Elizabeth’s hospital where he was able to serve patients, family, and hospital staff. For Personal Development, Sam actively participated in Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and had opportunities to expand on his leadership skills and abilities. To improve his Physical Fitness, Sam spent his time improving his golfing skills.

I told them about our missed opportunity in the first nine months of the Trump presidency to make meaningful tax reform, and my hope that Congress can get their act together and pass President Trump’s plan to cut taxes. They should be cutting federal spending to pay for an across-the-board tax cut that the American people deserve.  I explained some of the issues Congress has faced in the last month, including tying the Harvey relief package to a debt ceiling hike. As a result, we didn’t just raise the debt ceiling, but we made it unlimited for the next three months. I wanted to pay for relief through budget offsets. Instead of adding to our debt, we should use money that was earmarked for foreign aid, to pay for disaster relief funding.

Court refuses DC's request to rehear the case that recently struck down the city's unconstitutional ""good reason"" requirement for obtaining a concealed carry permit.

The city must rewrite their horrible gun laws for the third time since the Heller decision struck them down or they can appeal this to the Supreme Court.

I had the opportunity to discuss the tax reform framework that was released this week. This is a big opportunity for us to update a tax code which hasn’t been updated since 1986. I’ll work to see that the reforms not only help corporations grow and keep jobs in the US, but also help the small businesses like LLCs and S Corporations and all the employees who work for them. I also discussed my role on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the importance of quality infrastructure to facilitate commerce.    Before the celebration began, employees of Dow Chemical explained their difficulty in finding skilled workers, and how they are addressing that issue with apprenticeship programs that include working with the local Jefferson Community Technical College campus and area high schools.

Bump stocks, he said, speed up the rate of fire, but still require the shooter to pull the trigger once for each round that is discharged. Massie said for that reason, there is no basis under the law to regulate bump stocks.  He also said it's unlikely that the ATF would go further to regulate bump stocks in the Trump administration, given that it had the chance to do so under the Obama administration, and didn't.","link","http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/atf-signals-it-wont-issue-new-bump-stocks-regulation-after-las-vegas/article/2637966","washingtonexaminer.com",988,111,284,126,8,9,2,20

Yesterday I spoke about tax reform with Matt Welch (of Reason Magazine) on SiriusXM radio.  Here’s a full transcript of the interview, followed by a link to the article:  Reason: You and I, Thomas Massie, agree more than disagree on things.  Massie: Is that good?  Reason: I think so; I don't know. I mean, you're the one that has to live with yourself.  [We agree on] any number of things: on civil liberties, on hemp—which you grow on your off-the-grid compound there—and a bunch of other stuff. You are, last I heard, an enthusiastic ""Yes"" vote on this tax reform package, even though people like the Congressional Budget Office have said it's going to add 1.7 quadrillion pennies to the deficit. Walk me through how the person who hates the debt as much as you do, and who in fact voted against the precursor bill to all of this, which was the 10-year budget non-binding resolution based on a whole pile of fiction, how are you an enthusiastic Yes given this, Mr. Massie?  Massie: Well, the one thing that probably unites you and I more frequently than anything is that we want to reduce the size and scope of government.  Reason: Correct.  Massie: I determined shortly after coming to Congress and looking at the situation here that the size and scope of government is determined by the spending bills, not the taxing bills. This is why I voted against the precursor to this bill, which was the budget. The budget that the Republicans passed adds four or five trillion dollars to the debt and does not balance, so I voted against it.  In good faith, I can vote for these tax cuts, because if we voted for a budget that I would be for, these tax cuts would not add to the debt or the deficit.  Reason: Right, but that's a 10-ton ""if"" there, because that's not the reality that we live in. The reality would be that we—  Massie: Wait, wait, wait, let me back up. You're saying because my colleagues are irresponsible in spending us into oblivion, I don't get to follow my ideology and vote for tax cuts? I reject that.  Reason: I am not telling you what to do. But in the reality that we live in, if you cut taxes—we agree that the spending is out of control, so it's basically a choice between tax-and-spend, or tax-cut-and-spend. We had tax-cut-and-spend under George W. Bush, and…on one hand you get the thing that you and I like, which is that more money [is] in the pockets of most people, though not people like me who live in New York, because you people are trying to screw me. I get that, that's fine….  Massie: Look, when you make the tax code more fair, the people who benefited from an unfair tax code are going to be a little bit upset.  Reason: Right, although you should've gone after the mortgage interest rate deduction more than the state-and-local-taxes, but let's—  Massie: I want to get rid of all the deductions. All of them. Why are we doing any social engineering in the tax code?  Reason: Okay, again we agree, but….First of all: Do you just agree with the concept that that combination is going to grow the debt larger than it otherwise would be if you didn't do tax cuts? Or do you think that the supply-side magic dust is going to make that $1.7 trillion into something that's less significant?  Massie: Well, math is hard, but I like to do math. You're right: If what you're saying is that the debt is going to go up after we cut taxes, that is true, that will happen. And so I am not immune to that charge. But let me say this differently. Here in Washington, D.C., they keep saying that tax cuts need to be ""paid for."" That's a ridiculous notion. I want to pull my hair out, or throw my shoe at people here in D.C., when they say tax cuts need to be paid for.  Spending needs to be paid for. Tax cuts do not need to be paid for. They've got the whole notion backwards. This money is already theirs. That everything that you're going to make for the rest of your life belongs to the government, and then if they're going to give you some of that back they have to pay for it? No. What they need to do is pay for spending. And so, Matt, if we would have cut spending…let me give you my favorite example.  Next year in the budget, in the appropriations, we've got about 43 and a half billion dollars for Afghanistan in military spending, maybe seven billion for reconstruction. That's 50 billion dollars. They like to do these things over a 10-year window; if you multiply that times 10, that's $500 billion, half a trillion dollars. If they would just get us out of Afghanistan, you could pay for a third of—and here I am, I'm using the freaking swamp-speak!—but you could offset a third of the tax cuts. I'm not even immune to it….  Reason: I get what you're saying on the pay-for language, that there's something fundamentally wrong with that. On the other hand, if you look at what happened in Indiana, Mitch Daniels cut government first, and then Mike Pence afterwards cut taxes. For me, that makes sense. You have reduced the size of the thing.  The part of that that I would like you to quickly address is the concern on the debt overhang, the debt itself. If it's going to increase, is that not also a worrisome drag on economic growth in and of itself, in a way that makes you at least pause before enthusiastically voting yes later today?  Massie: Sure, it does.  But let me tell you, the best reason to vote for this bill—and it's not a populist reason, but I'm ready to go out there on a limb and say this—the best reason to vote for this bill is that it makes our corporate tax rate more competitive globally, and our companies won't be incentivized to move overseas or sell their brands to overseas companies. That is the best reason to vote for this….  Will the growth that's caused by the cut in taxes make up for the lost revenue? Will the government see more revenue instead of less revenue after we cut taxes? No, I don't believe you're going to get 100 percent of this back. You may get two-thirds of it back. But we have to cut spending, we have to do it. And I vote to cut spending every stinking time, but just because my colleagues don't believe that we have to cut spending doesn't mean I can't vote to cut taxes.  Reason: In my estimation, the political party is revealed when it controls things, when it actually has power, as opposed to what it said when it didn't. And I think it's been interesting to watch, especially after the 2009/2010 season, politicians like you coming in, Rand Paul in 2010, and all the focus was so much on spending, cutting spending, opposing Obamacare, debt ceilings and all this kind of stuff. Then when you control—not you, when they in this case control power—they are revealed. Mick Mulvaney, your colleague and possible friend, went from being almost as big of a fiscal conservative as you in the House to now as the Office of Management and Budget director or whatever saying, ""We need new deficits!""  I think it's remarkable to see how much the spending cut talk was not real. Let me ask you a quick—  Massie: Let me just take up a little bit for Mick Mulvaney, the OMB director. He sent us a budget that cut a lot of things. That is Trump's budget. But here in Congress they threw it in the trash, and they just…took last year's budget and added some spending to it and rolled on. If you did follow what Mick Mulvaney wants to do..., but of course he's got a boss now, and the boss isn't 750,000 people in South Carolina, his boss is Donald Trump, so he's subject to those constraints.  Reason: Let me follow on with that: The Senate does a lot of disregarding of what the president wants, but it also does a lot of disregarding of what the House wants. If the Senate passes—I think it's a big ""if"" at this point if they pass anything, given Ron Johnson and Bob Corker and others—but if they pass something that cheerfully disregards a lot of what was done in the House, do you think that it will actually go to a conference committee? Or is it going to be another fold job by your pals in the Freedom Caucus, who will say, ""Ah, well, tax reform is important, so let's just rubber-stamp this like we did the 10-year budget resolution""?  Massie: Can I tell you something I've never said, and I may never say again? I think the bill is getting better in the Senate, not worse, and I say that honestly. Particularly on the individual, personal tax cut side. The House bill had trillions of dollars of tax reform for individuals, but it only had billions of dollars of tax cuts for individuals. Which means this House bill—and I'm going to say this, and most Republicans aren't going to be this honest with you—some people are going to see their taxes go up.  On average, most people will see their taxes go down, but because we've got a lot of reform and not enough tax cuts, you'll see some people's taxes go up. The Senate bill is better in that regard. As far as I can tell, they triple the amount of tax cuts that go to W2 wage-earners as compared to the House bill, which means it's less likely if you're a W2 wage earner that you will see your taxes go up under the Senate bill.  Reason: […] Do you think there's going to be any drag in the House, or is it pretty smooth sailing at this point?  Massie: There are people like my colleague Walter Jones from North Carolina who thinks that the debt is more important than this tax bill, and he would not be subject to the charge that you leveled against me, because I think he's voting no on this bill even though he's a conservative. He's as conservative as me, maybe more so.  I think they've got the votes to pass it in the House today. I hear the President's coming over in just a little bit to do a rally with the Republicans, and I hope he doesn't say it's a ""mean"" bill after it passes, after he comes over here and does the rally. But it'll pass and then it's off to the Senate, and they'll have to do something after Thanksgiving. I think it's highly likely that we pass whatever the Senate comes up with, simply because they've got a narrower path to getting something done, and they'll say, ""If you change it too much, we won't be able to pass it again over here in the Senate.""  So I think it's likely—you asked if this would happen—I think it is likely the House passes whatever the Senate comes up with, or if it goes to conference, which it could do because they might want to buy more time to get this thing right, I think whatever comes out of conference will look more like the Senate bill than the House bill.  http://reason.com/blog/2017/11/17/thomas-massie-on-tax-reform-its-highly-l","status",NA,NA,172,54,37,16,2,3,0,13

The U.S. Service Academies offer a unique opportunity for motivated young men and women to serve their country while improving all facets of their character through a rigorous scholastic curriculum and a disciplined moral and physical regimen.  In place of tuition, the Academies require military service after graduation. Cadets and Midshipmen graduate as Officers in the United States Military, and many have gone on to be great leaders in our nation’s history.  After the deadline to apply to a Service Academy passes, an interview panel evaluates applicants and makes recommendations on who will receive a nomination.

Those outlawed business models could have lowered prices and increased access.  By stretching a Congressional law that predates the internet, Obama’s administration (through the FCC) was able to regulate the internet without Congressional approval.   Trump’s administration (through the FCC) is therefore able to undo that overreach without the need to seek our approval.  Yet many are reaching out to me on this topic, asking me to perpetuate this regulation through legislation.    I didn’t campaign on regulating the internet.  On the contrary, I campaigned on stopping the government from meddling with the internet.

Without U.S. targeting and refueling, Saudi planes could not attack the Houthis effectively and Riyadh could not win this war.

If the United States were to tell Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that we were no longer going to support his war in Yemen, the Saudis would have to accept the reality that they have lost.

Just let this sentence sink in...  “A GOP offer to lift the Pentagon budget by more than $54 billion next year and nondefense limits by $37 billion was rejected by Democrats demanding balance between the two sides of the ledger.”  Instead of compromising on areas of spending to cut, they’re negotiating on how much each side gets to add to their favorite parts of the budget. Looks like they’ll each add about $50 billion beyond the spending caps for their favorite programs this year.  But wait, there’s more...  These numbers don’t include what’s now likely, according to this AP article, to be nearly $100 billion in off-ledger (not-paid-for and not-budgeted) hurricane spending in one year...  “Congress has approved more than $50 billion in aid in response to a series of devastating hurricanes. The most recent request by the White House is the largest yet at $44 billion, but it’s not nearly enough to satisfy the powerful Texas delegation, which is pressing behind the scenes for more.”  And more off-ledger spending...  Most of our wars and nation building in the Middle East are not even counted in the spending caps either.  At a minimum, that will be another $50 billion this year.    $50b R over budget spending  $50b D over budget spending  $50b Hurricane $ so far $50b Hurricane $ next month $50b “Contingency” (war) —�—�— $250b above and beyond the so called spending caps that, by law, Congress agreed to follow just a few years ago.  That’s for one year alone!  Washington budgets are discussed in 10 year terms, so that means if they do this every year, this behavior will add $2.5 trillion to the debt.  That doesn’t include billions of automatic increases every year in what Washington calls mandatory spending for entitlement programs.  This excessive spending above and beyond the budget is obscene.

As Chairman of the Second Amendment Caucus, I’m blowing the whistle on the swamp.  Last week, Republicans in the House fast tracked through committee HR 4477, a gun bill titled “fix-NICS.”  The Senate version of this bill is cosponsored by Senator Dianne Feintstein and Senator Chuck Schumer and it will send $625 million over 5 years to states to expand the national background check database.  The bill will also advance former President Obama’s agenda of pressuring every branch of the administration (such as the Veteran’s Administration) to submit thousands of more names to the NICS background check database to deny gun purchases.  The House bill is identical in every way to the Senate bill except the House bill will also commission a study on bump-stocks.  What you don’t know, and what virtually no one in Washington wants you to know, is that House leadership plans to merge the fix-NICS bill with popular Concealed Carry Reciprocity legislation, HR 38, and pass both of them with a single vote.  Folks, this is how the swamp works.  House leadership expects constituents to call their representatives demanding a vote on the reciprocity bill, when in fact the only vote will be on the two combined bills.    How fast did Fix-NICS, HR 4477, move through the Judiciary Committee?  This bill broke the previous records for fast track legislation.  It was voted out of committee within hours of being introduced in the House.  Check the dates on this link: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4477/text . That means the text of the bill wasn’t even discoverable by the public on congress.gov until after the bill passed out of committee!  The text was however available over in the Senate where you will find Senator Diane Feinstein and Senator Chuck Schumer are cosponsors.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2135/cosponsors    If that’s not odd enough, consider this: the fix-NICS bill was introduced in the House by a Democrat two weeks ago.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4434/text .  But, in a very unusual move, the bill was re-introduced verbatim by a Republican two weeks later, with language added to it to commission a bump-stock study.  Six Republicans in Judiciary Committee weren’t persuaded by the switcheroo, and voted No. However, because every Democrat voted yes and some Republicans voted yes at the urging of the Chairman, the bill made it out of committee.  The deed will be complete this week when the bill is quietly added to the Reciprocity bill, HR 38, and passed without the knowledge of those who would oppose the legislation if they knew what was in it.  To recap, what are some clues that you should be concerned with the fix-NICS bill?    (1) The first sentence after the title of the bill reads “Section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (34 U.S.C. 40901) is amended…” (2) Senators Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer are cosponsors in the Senate. (3) It’s being rammed through, without a hearing, in a very nontransparent process, and it will be passed by attaching it to the popular concealed carry reciprocity bill which already has enough votes to pass on its own. (4) It spends over half a billion dollars to collect more names to include in a list of people who will never be allowed to own a firearm. (5) It compels administrative agencies, not just courts, to adjudicate your second amendment rights.  In my opinion, #5 is the biggest problem.  The bill encourages administrative agencies, not the courts, to submit more names to a national database that will determine whether you can or can’t obtain a firearm.  When President Obama couldn’t get Congress to pass gun control, he implemented a strategy of compelling, through administrative rules, the Veterans Administration and the Social Security Administration to submit lists of veterans and seniors, many of whom never had a day in court, to be included in the NICS database of people prohibited from owning a firearm. Only a state court, a federal (article III) court, or a military court, should ever be able to suspend your rights for any significant period of time.  Does the NICS background check system have problems?  Yes, it results in tens of thousands of unjustified denials of gun purchases every year.  But like many bills in Congress, the fix-NICS doesn’t live up to its name – it will likely do the opposite.  It throws millions of dollars at a faulty program and it will result in more law-abiding citizens being deprived of their right to keep and bear arms.   If we continue to give the executive branch more money and encouragement to add names to the list of people prohibited from buying a firearm (without a day in court) and if the gun banners achieve their goal of universal background checks, one day, a single person elected to the office of President will be able to achieve universal gun prohibition.  House leadership should immediately de-couple the fix-NICS legislation from the concealed carry reciprocity legislation.  People hate it when Washington combines bills like our leadership plans to do this week.   A few have speculated that the House is combining the bills to ensure reciprocity will pass in the Senate.  I have some news for them:  Senators Feinstein and Schumer aren’t going to vote for reciprocity even if it contains the fix-NICS legislation they support for expanding the background check database.  If someone is naïve enough to think that’s going to work, and they’re willing to accept fix-NICS to get reciprocity, then they should ask the Senate to go first with the combined bill.  Here’s a dangerous scenario that’s more likely to play out: The House uses the popularity of reciprocity (HR 38) to sneak fix-NICS through, while the Senate passes fix-NICS only.  The Senate and the House meet at conference with their respective bills, with the result being fix-NICS emerges from conference without reciprocity.  Fix-NICS comes back to the House and passes because all of the Democrats will vote for it (as they just did in Judiciary Committee) and many Republicans will vote for it.  Because Republicans already voted for it once as part of the reciprocity deal that never came to pass, they won’t have a solid footing for opposing fix-NICS as a standalone bill.  Then we’ll end up with fix-NICS, which is basically an expansion of the Brady Bill, without reciprocity.  If our House leadership insists on bringing the flawed fix-NICS bill to the floor, they shouldn’t play games.  We should vote separately on HR 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Bill, and HR 4477, the fix-NICS bill. And we should be given enough time to amend the fix-NICS bill, because it needs to be fixed, if not axed.","status",NA,NA,1474,718,7913,26,7,213,18,923

My wife let me use her ticket to take my youngest daughter to the White House Christmas Ball recently.  My daughter is never one to miss an opportunity, so she bravely asked President Trump if he could “make school lunches great again?!”  Instead of laughing, he took her very seriously and said he needed to work with me on that.  He then told her I had more power than him.  I suspect he chose those words out of respect for the balance the Founders established between the Executive and Legislative branches, and because he knew it would be a nice thing to say in front of a father and his daughter.  In any case, my daughter and I were both impressed with his answer!  She has been studying the Constitution at school.   I know the school lunch guidelines were modified under the prior administration in a well intended effort to make lunches healthier, but my discussions with school lunch nutritionists, cooks, administrators, students, and my own children have convinced me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the pendulum swung too far.  How healthy can food be once it becomes too unpalatable to eat?   Personally, I don’t think the federal government should dictate what our children are served to eat at school.  But being that the federal government is involved, help (in the form of relief from federal restrictions) is in the works.  Some of the rules can be undone administratively, since they were implemented administratively.  But to truly make school lunches great again, or rather to give schools the local flexibility to make them great again, might require an act of Congress!  If you have children who don’t like school lunches, let them know that my daughter has been lobbying on their behalf this Christmas!  PS. Thank you Mr. President for signing HR 1, the tax reform bill, this Christmas.  I was pleased to vote yes on this bill.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepThomasMassie/photos/a.931648290192669.1073741980.452480994776070/1869535929737229/?type=3",NA,4241,532,522,808,61,11,5,12
