Israel is our strongest ally in an increasingly unstable region, and to allow a resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council that states that Judaism’s holiest sites are an ‘occupied territory’ is absolutely unacceptable.   The United States has a long history of voting down anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council- in fact, the United States has vetoed 42 anti-Israel resolutions since 1972. Unfortunately, President Obama and his Administration have chosen to ignore the special relationship between the United States and Israel, which is reprehensible. We must continue our nation’s long tradition of standing with Israel.","status",NA,NA,93,12,6,4,0,1,0,0

It all started when J. H. Penn, a veteran West Texas Oil operator came in on the railway and drilled the discovery well of the Penwell-Jordan oilfield. On October 7, 1929, the area took off with the drilling of Penn’s well, the R. R. Penn Kloh-Rumsey No. 1. Because it was Penn’s oil well, the town became known as “Pennwell”.   The prospects started the same as any West Texas town that begun during the oil boom. By 1931 the town had nearly 3,000 residents, despite the town being only 2-3 years old. Although population statistics were hard to calculate due to migrant workers,  during the early 1930s the town had six lumberyards, several filling stations, multiple clothing stores, two hotels, a doctor's office, a drugstore, a barbershop, a pool hall, a coffee shop, a dance hall, and a paper, the Penwell News. However, like many oil towns when the work began to dwindle the population migrated to towns with more work. Today, the Joker Coffee Shop is one of the few things left standing. #WestTexas #OilTown","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mike.conaway/photos/a.203542246349300.50628.203482063021985/1229875243715990/?type=3",NA,83,4,26,0,1,0,1,0

Luis joined the Army in 2000, became an officer in 2004, and served five combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. While leading his team on December 27, 2011, an IED detonated nearby. Three soldiers were killed by the blast, and two others were severely wounded. Luis suffered two strokes, two heart attacks, amputation of his left leg, and a severe head injury that stopped oxygen from getting to his brain. He went into a very long coma, and the doctors pulled Claudia aside and told her that he was not going to make it. She told them, ""you gotta have faith."" A month later, Luis opened his eyes for the first time.   Last November, Luis, Claudia, and their three sons moved into a new smart home, thanks to the Gary Sinise Foundation. The home has many features that allow Luis to be independent, like automatic opening doors, wide pathways, and an elevator. It's also close to Walter Reed Medical Center, where Luis is continuing his therapies.   Luis and Claudia, you are extraordinary examples of faith, love, and sacrifice.

The German immigrant society had purchased the Fisher-Miller grant, of 3.88 million acres. However, the Comanche had already claimed that area as their hunting grounds. It became the responsibility of John Meusebach, the 33-year-old commissioner-general of the immigrant group, to make peace with the Comanche.   In January, Chief Ketemoczy of the Penetaka Comanche met Meusebach, who explained the immigrants' friendly intentions. Chief Ketemoczy was receptive, and promised to summon the chiefs of the western bands of Comanche to a peace council on the San Saba River.   When the talks concluded with a peace pipe and an agreement, the treaty allowed the colonists to travel freely between the Llano and San Saba rivers. The Comanche could also come into the settlers' towns without fear, and would receive the colonists' support against their enemies.   This was a unique treaty, because the government had no part in it. There were a few infringements over time, but the treaty held the test of time.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mike.conaway/photos/a.203542246349300.50628.203482063021985/1297618126941701/?type=3",NA,51,6,12,0,0,0,0,1

Poor planning caused many soldiers at Ft. Sumner to go to bed hungry, so the two men packed their bags. They took their cattle and headed north, as far Wyoming. This historic journey would create the Goodnight-Loving Trail.   The trail began along the Concho River near the Fort in the area and is often regarded as the most historic cattle trail in the west. The prevalence of the trail led to many settlers moving towards Ft. Concho, and this migration would help begin what is now San Angelo. This story is just another example of the important role that the region has played in not only Texas but America. Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving were truly pioneers of their time and we are all better today for them.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mike.conaway/photos/a.203542246349300.50628.203482063021985/1322340094469504/?type=3",NA,68,10,9,3,0,0,0,0

It was such a hit they made it an annual celebration! Initially, the rodeo was held at the Coleman High School Football field, but by 1947, the Coleman Rodeo Association decided it was time to create a real rodeo facility. It grew over time, and today the area features a livestock show barn, perimeter fence, pecan trees, an outdoor dance pavilion, and a horse barn. In an era where we are surrounded by technology, the Annual Coleman Rodeo remains committed to the original traditions of the Texas Rodeo.   This summer, the Rodeo will be held June 8-10, and in addition to the rodeo, it features live music from Sam Riggs, William Clark Green, the Kevin Seale Band, and Koe Wetzel.

The site of Chicago was established on the Bartow Ranch by W.C. Bishop – a Chicago, Illinois, native. In just a few short years, another community formed down the road. The Chicago post office was moved and Chicago’s name was changed to Stemmons after Walter Stemmons took over the roles of Bartow ranch foreman and postmaster. Years later, Stemmons and Lamesa came into competition for the Dawson county seat. An election took place, and with just five more votes, Lamesa became the official county seat. Today, the town of Chicago no longer exists, but is remembered by a historical marker and a Lamesa street named after the town.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mike.conaway/photos/a.203542246349300.50628.203482063021985/1322345114469002/?type=3",NA,19,2,2,0,0,1,0,0

These forces faced a stretch of 200 yards of open sand before any sort of cover from the relentless machine fire and artillery. While they fought their way across the beaches and up the cliffs beyond, thousands of paratroopers that had jumped into the area in the pre-dawn hours battled to destroy German defenses and to secure the roads and bridges that the Nazis could use to reinforce their troops and repel the invasion. The fighting was gruesome and ceaseless, but by the end of the day, Allied forces had their foothold in Europe. Hitler’s “Sea Wall” had been breached.  The D-Day operation was described by Winston Churchill as, “undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever been endured.” The success of the landings came at a heavy price: over 10,000 Allied casualties. The sacrifice and courage of these men and others beside them gave the Allies the position that they needed to begin the push into Nazi Europe. We will always be indebted to those who have fought and continue to fight for our freedom, and seventy-three years later, we remember the men of Operation Overlord.  “Strengthened by their courage, heartened by their valor, and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died.” – Ronald Reagan, 1984","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mike.conaway/photos/a.203542246349300.50628.203482063021985/1334268689943311/?type=3",NA,50,2,16,5,0,2,0,0

Today it is considered one of the best preserved military outposts in Texas.

During this time period, the compound also housed a number of Buffalo Soldiers. Fort McKavett was completely abandoned in 1883.

FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency has released these safety tips to prepare yourself:   FEMA recommends visitors and residents in areas potentially affected by Hurricane Harvey take the following actions: If the storm is expected to affect your area, know your evacuation zone and follow the direction of state, local or tribal officials if an evacuation is ordered for your area. Storm surge poses a significant threat for drowning and can sometimes cut off evacuation routes, so do not delay leaving if an evacuation is ordered for your area.  Monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information, and follow the instructions of state, local, and tribal officials.  There is the potential for flooding and storm surge with Hurricane Harvey. Driving through a flooded area can be extremely hazardous. Nearly half of all flash flood deaths happen in vehicles. Stay safe when in your car by watching for flooding in low lying areas, at bridges and highway dips. As little as six inches of water may cause you to lose control of your vehicle. If you encounter floodwaters, remember – turn around, don’t drown.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/24/hurricane-harveys-storm-path-what-should-know.html","foxnews.com",12,6,3,0,0,0,0,0

If you are in an impacted area, remember that this is still a dangerous storm. If you come across a flooded area, it's always better to turn around.   Only call 911 if you have an immediate need for medical attention or evacuation assistance. If you can't get through to 911 on first try, keep calling.  Another option is to place a call to one of five numbers for the Houston Command Center of the United States Coast Guard.

Small businesses have been held back, unable to grow and create jobs under the current burdensome tax code. Tax reform changes that, putting Main Street back in the driver’s seat. In fact, the average American family will see an extra $4,000 back in their pockets each year.  Modernizing our tax code in the face of globalization puts the needs of our nation, our businesses, and our families first. And that’s a plan for America we can all support.
