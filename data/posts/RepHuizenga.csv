Today, I learned that the company my office uses to facilitate the telephone town halls mistakenly removed a number of cellphones.

This should not have happened. In an age where cell phones are equal to if not more prevalent than ""land lines,"" this policy doesn't make sense and I have asked that they do NOT apply this policy to residents of the Second District who sign up to participate in a telephone town hall.  I sincerely apologize to those of you who waited for a call last night that never came. I truly appreciate your willingness to engage in the democratic process and participate in a tele-town hall.

The health and vitality of the Great Lakes is instrumental to having a productive Great Lakes economy that creates good-paying jobs and sustained economic growth.  Ultimately, it is Congress that has the constitutional authority to determine which programs are funded. In an era where federal spending must be prioritized, I believe the GLRI, which has a history of proven results and strong bipartisan support, should continue to be a national priority.

The American Health Care Act repeals the job-destroying taxes and punitive mandates of ObamaCare while lowering premiums and restoring the freedom for hardworking Michiganders to choose the healthcare plan that best fits their needs – not what Washington dictates they must have.   This legislation also includes important protections for Americans to ensure those with a pre-existing condition are not denied coverage. Lastly, in terms of Medicaid, the AHCA provides states with the flexibility and tools necessary to innovate so each state can meet the unique needs of their residents. As the American Health Care Act heads to the Senate, I encourage our Senators to remember that ObamaCare is collapsing. It’s time to move away from the Washington knows best mentality and let the American people make their own health care decisions.","link","http://huizenga.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398451","huizenga.house.gov",261,822,58,11,10,1,47,589

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides more opportunity for West Michigan families living paycheck to paycheck to achieve the American Dream.   Our plan lowers tax rates, doubles the standard deduction, increases the Child Tax Credit, preserves the Adoption Tax Credit, and creates a new Family Tax Credit that will provide real tax relief for hardworking middle class families across West Michigan. Additionally, our legislation will increase economic growth by cutting taxes on small businesses so they can invest more of their money into growing their local business and create new jobs in our community.  Lastly, our legislation also lowers the corporate tax rate so Michigan job creators of all sizes can compete against foreign companies, expand in Michigan, and create good-paying jobs.   Our nation’s tax code hasn’t been overhauled in three decades. In that time, economic growth has failed to reach its potential while special interests and the well-connected have created loopholes for themselves at the expense of low and moderate income families.
