Words strung together in hate can create manifestos, which open ovens filled with families and trees with ""Strange Fruit"" hanging from them.   Words can heal and wash away pain.

This decision is deeply disturbing for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it’s a cruel indication that he doesn’t fully understand the issues facing transgender students across the country. This decision will greatly impact their well-being by sending the message that their concerns are irrelevant and emboldening bullies in schools to discriminate against them.  Our transgender population faces unimaginable discrimination and tragically, 40% of transgender adults have attempted suicide with 92% of them attempting suicide before the age of 25. It’s our moral responsibility to do all we can to see to it that these numbers drop. We do that by encouraging transgender students to be their true selves and by promoting fair treatment.  I implore the President to follow the First Lady’s example of wanting to stop bullying by reconsidering this rollback of key protections for transgender students. These young people are just that, people, and they deserve better from their government. I’m going to keep fighting for them even if this administration will not.","link","http://bluntrochester.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=13","bluntrochester.house.gov",302,62,51,11,1,2,25,28

Trump's joint address to Congress. The Affordable Care Act saved her life.   I’ve acknowledged that there is room to improve the Affordable Care Act to promote access and to drive costs down, but we cannot simply repeal it without a viable replacement plan. The bottom line is that not only will tens of thousands of Delawareans be stripped of their healthcare, but thousands of good-paying jobs will be lost. Unfortunately, the GOP’s outline is one that they can’t even agree on and will undoubtedly raise the out-of-pocket health care costs of working families. We have to come together and have an honest conversation, with members of both political parties at the table, about the ways we can improve quality of care and affordability for Delawareans and Americans alike. I will not abandon my convictions or play politics with the lives of my constituents because the truth is, for Kerry and so many other Delawareans, this is a life or death situation and I hope that President Trump as well as my GOP colleagues in Congress realize just how dangerous repealing the Affordable Care Act would be.","link","http://bluntrochester.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=16","bluntrochester.house.gov",179,22,29,16,0,0,0,0

My colleagues in the Democratic Caucus have all acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but we’ve focused on working to improve it instead of tearing healthcare away from millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Delawareans. From cancer survivors worried that they will never get the care they deserve because the House GOP health care bill has gutted pre-existing condition protections, to seniors concerned that they won’t be able to afford coverage at all, Delawareans across my state have called and emailed my office to express how terrified they are of this legislation.

Furthermore, Attorney General Sessions rightly recused himself from any investigation into cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia, yet he made a recommendation to President Trump that Director Comey be fired. Rather than building confidence and providing Congress - and the American people with answers, we are left only with more questions as a result of the actions of the Trump Administration.  What we know for sure is that there has never been a more pressing time for a special prosecutor and an independent investigation into Russian ties to President Trump and the presidential election. Calmer heads must prevail and we must put politics aside to protect our democracy. We cannot allow public trust in the Department of Justice or in our government as a whole to be eroded because partisanship is prioritized over the truth.

As a result of constant mixed messages from the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans, and a lack of willingness to bring all sides to the table, the individual insurance marketplaces within the ACA have been greatly destabilized. It is within this environment we find ourselves today with rising premiums and fewer choices. Delaware families deserve competition and choices when selecting their health insurance.  I call on my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats in a bi-partisan manner to improve the law.

Currently, the House Appropriations Committee has begun work on the twelve 2018 appropriations bills (which fund the federal government) without revealing its overall 2018 funding outline and hence the majority leadership in the committee is not being fully transparent about the fiscal tradeoffs they are making in the federal budget.","link","https://bluntrochester.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=45","bluntrochester.house.gov",160,19,18,10,1,0,0,0

STEM education is increasingly important in our economy as we become more and more dependent on new and evolving technologies, and I’m glad that Congress continues to showcase the tremendous talents of our students. I encourage all students to participate and I look forward to seeing what they come up with.   The Challenge will run through November 1, 2017. The competition is open to all students who meet the eligibility requirements, regardless of coding experience. We strongly encourage all students of all skill levels to participate and to learn how to create their own apps. Winners will be selected by a panel of judges and be given Congressional recognition for their achievements in STEM and Computer Science. Their apps will be featured in the U.S. Capitol, on House.gov, and the Congressional App Challenge website.    The CAC was created because Congress recognized that STEM and computer-based skills are essential for economic growth and innovation, and that the U.S. has been falling behind in these areas. By some estimates, the U.S. may be short by as many as a million programmers by 2020. These are high-paying, high-demand jobs that can be filled by American workers with the proper training. To maintain American competitiveness, it’s crucial that the U.S. invests in our youth today, so they have the needed skills that will prepare them for their careers. The CAC encourages all students to pursue those skills and recognizes them for their efforts.    Recognizing the racial, gendered, and other disparities in the tech sector, the CAC also prioritizes inclusivity in working diligently to ensure students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to participate.    The Internet Education Foundation will be serving as the operational “sponsor” of the CAC.

That day, I carried a scarf that my sister made for me. The scarf was of a print she found when studying our family history. My great-great-great grandfather, a former slave, had signed the document with an ‘X’ to vote in Georgia during the Reconstruction Era. He couldn’t sign his full name, he could only sign an ‘X.’   Standing there, taking my oath of office with the scarf in my hand and recognizing that my election represented where we came from, I realized that change is possible. But change is only possible if we are willing to recognize and see each other as humans, as neighbors, as Americans.   Over the last few days, we’ve seen history repeat itself – race riots broke out in Charlottesville and our president not only failed to denounce and condemn white supremacy, he doubled down on his view that the blame falls on both sides. We’ve seen the leader of our great nation give license to violence and hate. He has signaled to the ‘alt-right’ movement that they are empowered to continue in pursuit of their cause to wipe out those who look, pray, and love differently than them.   The events that occurred in Charlottesville are indicative of a larger divide in our country. This is a seminal moment in our history – one where our president and our elected leaders can unite behind a message of peace and justice and be role models for positive progress. It is our responsibility to honor our history, not only cherish it. It is our responsibility to recognize the mistakes of our past and to be courageous enough to ensure we never repeat them.   The people who stood up and spoke out to help my great-great-great grandfather finally get his right to vote, prevailed. They understood that progress wasn’t inevitable. They understood that it required a concerted effort in pursuit of justice. And today, as Heather Heyer’s family and friends mourn her loss, it’s paramount that we honor her memory, the fortitude of those who stood alongside her, and the memory of our ancestors by recommitting to that same pursuit of justice.    If you believe you would have stood up and fought against oppression, whether you would have marched with Dr. King or if you would have given safe-haven to Jews fleeing the Nazi’s –  stand up now, march now, create safe spaces now. Our freedom depends on it.","link","https://bluntrochester.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=58","bluntrochester.house.gov",1327,254,348,385,0,4,4,17
