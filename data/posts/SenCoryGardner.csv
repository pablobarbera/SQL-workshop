Cybersecurity policy is one of the most complex and significant challenges facing Congress, yet the Senate’s structure to investigate and address cyber issues is diffuse and inadequate. This has led to an uncoordinated policy response to recent cyber attacks on government agencies, businesses, and infrastructure. The scope of the cyber threat is as varied as the actors who are responsible for them and the consequences of potential attacks. Therefore, as cyber risks threats evolve so must U.S. cybersecurity policy. The establishment of a Select Committee on Cybersecurity is essential to investigating emerging cyber risks and bolstering our defenses against them through legislative solutions, and I’m hopeful that my colleagues recognize that a centralized structure is the best path forward to effectively tackle the cyber challenge.","link","https://www.gardner.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gardner-coons-introduce-legislation-to-create-select-committee-on-cybersecurity","gardner.senate.gov",197,292,21,1,1,3,0,38

While the private sector invests billions annually in research and development, many in industry have indicated an inability to provide significantly more capital, leaving their investments stranded without adequate federal investment. A 4% increase from FY2017 levels is appropriate and modest compared to several historical appropriations increases.   The United States is facing fierce international competition: China invests more than $335 billion annually on research and development initiatives, making them the second largest investor in the world and putting them on track to eclipse U.S. investments soon. Without a substantial increase in research and development appropriations, the United States risks losing its role as the global leader in innovation.

Colorado veterans have been put on secret wait lists and denied access to care they have earned. This is unacceptable and it must change. My legislation will expand the CHOICE program and allow veterans to see the doctor they choose and not be hamstrung by the VA bureaucracy. It’s time we put partisan politics aside and deliver on our promise to our veterans.

Infrastructure affects everyone across our state and going forward, I’ll keep fighting for Colorado at the federal level.","link","https://coloradopolitics.com/185973-2/","coloradopolitics.com",305,488,44,9,28,5,4,140

Joe George is an American hero and deserves this long-awaited honor. Colorado Springs resident, Donald Stratton, has been fighting the bureaucracy for 16 years, and was finally able to make sure Joe George was honored for saving his life, and five other lives, that fateful day. I met with Donald Stratton twice over the past few months and am honored I was able to work with him to honor Joe George.

No one should be forced to work in an environment where they are made to feel uncomfortable or intimidated. Let me be extremely clear: sexual harassment and workplace misconduct has no place in America, and certainly has no place in the United States Congress. I’m proud to join U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator Ted Cruz, and my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to introduce this bipartisan legislation that reforms the way Congress deals with harassment. This legislation ensures we have an open, transparent process that does not leave the taxpayers on the hook for Members of Congress’ misconduct. I’m proud to introduce this bill today and call on each of my colleagues to support this important proposal.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenCoryGardner/videos/1618825564830791/",NA,628,1412,69,41,17,9,10,273

Congress has finally answered the call to cut taxes and reform the tax code, and I’m proud to help deliver this relief to all of Colorado. At the beginning of this process, my goal was to bring relief to hardworking Coloradans throughout the four corners of our great state, and I’m proud that after months of work we have achieved this goal. Coloradans at every income level will receive a tax cut and popular provisions that help hardworking Coloradans like greater tax relief for childcare services, the student loan interest deduction, the medical expense deduction, and tax breaks for teachers are all part of the final bill.   After years of complacency and being told we have to accept meager economic growth, the American people will once again see their economy accelerate. This tax relief package will lead to economic growth, higher wages, and more jobs. The American people sent their representatives to Washington to bring relief and I’m proud to have delivered on this promise during the first year of a unified Republican government.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenCoryGardner/videos/1624016197645061/",NA,1217,6422,400,170,92,15,98,4781
