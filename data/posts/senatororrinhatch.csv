There, he worked in the Plans and Training section, where he carried out routine tasks far away from serious combat.  But that all changed on December 7, 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Royce found himself fighting in the bloodiest arenas of World War II. Royce and his fellow soldiers survived months of Japanese bombing raids until they were forced to surrender to the Japanese Army in the spring of 1942. In the aftermath of defeat, Royce was forced into the Bataan Death March, which today is recognized as one of the worst atrocities ever perpetrated against American POWS.  Over several weeks, American POWs endured extreme hardship and a level of physical suffering that you and I can scarcely imagine. Miraculously, Royce survived the death march, but his trials were far from over. He was held captive as a POW for many years and was later imprisoned at Camp O’Donnell on the Island of Luzon.    During his internment, Royce suffered physical abuse, sleep deprivation, and extreme starvation, losing more than a third of his total body weight. When he enlisted, Royce weighed a robust 155 pounds; at war’s end, he weighed only 95.  Both as a soldier and as a civilian, Royce led an honorable life, marked by courage, character, and an unwavering commitment to God and country. He leaves behind a legacy of love and sacrifice that will surely inspire future generations. Royce’s story was first brought to my attention by his daughter, Patricia Fuhriman Eckman, and her husband, Bob.  They felt strongly that Royce’s life and hardships deserved recognition.    After learning of Royce’s story, I brought his case again before the Army.   Patricia and I then worked together to demonstrate that the health challenges and maladies he was subjected to as a POW were more than worthy of a Purple Heart.  We owe Fuhriman a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid. I am so grateful that this Purple Heart has now found its rightful home.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatororrinhatch/photos/a.509679322485151.1073741828.428762107243540/1217769175009492/?type=3",NA,36,7,0,5,0,0,0,0

As a person of faith myself, I was moved by their earnest desire to reclaim these religious records for the benefit of future generations.

Following that discussion and a number of conversations that have followed, tomorrow Hatch will introduce legislation to make critical mental health resources more accessible to those considering harming themselves, particularly teenagers and veterans.

This bill is part and parcel to that effort. By giving law enforcement officials the tools they need to prosecute individuals who threaten to deface, damage, or destroy religious property, we can safeguard the freedom to worship for future generations.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatororrinhatch/videos/1293279104125165/",NA,59,44,10,5,0,2,0,13

That’s why last December I convened a roundtable discussion with community leaders, healthcare professionals, principals, and parents at East High School in Salt Lake City. There, we discussed proven methods to destigmatize mental illness and address the teen suicide crisis. In response to what I learned at our roundtable discussion, I will introduce the bipartisan National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act, which will make it easier for Americans to access the help and treatment they need when they consider harming themselves.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatororrinhatch/photos/a.509679322485151.1073741828.428762107243540/1293353540784388/?type=3",NA,79,77,10,3,0,1,14,8

The troop is made up of Karen and Karenni refugees who came to Utah from refugee camps in Thailand after fleeing from Myanmar. Their story is incredible. In 2015 I had the opportunity to help this troop with travel visas so they could visit their home countries for the first time in a decade. In the two years since that meeting the scouting program has spread rapidly among refugee communities in Utah to include Nepali, Thai/Laotian, Swahili-speaking from East Africa, Vietnamese, and Muslim troops, with scouts from Africa and the Middle East.

As I said on Saturday, Jesse didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home. I will never hesitate to speak out against hate--whenever and wherever I see it.  In the wake of this weekend's violence, our nation has some soul-searching to do. It is not a time to say ""What about"" but to seriously ask ourselves ""What now?   The choice before us is stark: Either we succumb to the bigotry and tribalism which threaten to tear us apart--or we condemn evil in all its forms and determine to come together as one nation, one people, united under God.   I believe in the infinite capacity of the American people. And I believe that the unbreakable bonds of affection, which for so long have held us together as a nation, are stronger than the forces which seek to divide us.   Above all, I believe in the virtue of civility. While I have strived to demonstrate compassion, comity, and respect throughout my public service, I have, at various times, fallen short of the ideal. But today, I am recommitting myself to civility--and I hope you will join me in doing the same.   Civility requires that we approach debate and discourse with sound logic and new ideas, not with cardboard shields and tiki torches. It asks that we bear our beliefs proudly and in the open, not behind the cowardly anonymity of social media accounts.   The tragedy in Charlottesville calls for a moment of national renewal.

Talk about the treatments and resources that are available to those in need, talk about the real causes of suicide and what we can do to combat them, and talk about how we can help those around us who might be considering harming themselves.

More than two centuries later, our nation’s founding document remains among the most consequential texts ever written. The Constitution not only delineated our most fundamental freedoms; it also laid the groundwork for the most successful republic the world has ever seen.  It’s no wonder, then, that our allies have long looked to American government as a model of freedom and functionality. Indeed, our Constitution gave rise to a slew of imitators in countries across the world, but none has ever achieved the same success.  Consider the facts: More than 200 nation-states have produced more than 900 constitutions, but the average life expectancy of each constitution is only 19 years.  Meanwhile, the Constitution of the United States endures, and today, stands apart as the oldest operative national charter on the planet.   To ensure that our Constitution continues to endure, we must pass on to the next generation a proper understanding of what the Constitution is—and why it is worth preserving.  The Constitution is the law that the people use to govern government.  It grants certain powers to government and sets limits on those powers.  It is how the people remain, as one Founding Father said, “masters of the government.”  But today, there is a war waging in our courtrooms over the essential meaning of the Constitution—and the outcome of this conflict will determine whether we remain masters of the government or if the government becomes master of the people.  Fighting this battle are two very different kinds of judges. One kind knows that judges must be governed by the Constitution; the other kind seeks to govern the Constitution. This choice, between judges who know the Constitution belongs to the people and judges who believe it belongs to them, determines our liberty and the kind of country in which we exercise it.   Activist judges who overstep their bounds seek to control our freedom and remake the Constitution in their image. The fruit of their labors is an alarmingly powerful federal government, unrestricted abortion, and restricted religious freedom.  The people chose none of these disastrous paths—judges did.  The previous President appointed judges who, he said, would decide cases based on their “deepest values…core concerns…[and their] broader perspectives on how the world works.”  According to his view, the judge—not the law—decides the outcome of cases.  Unlike our previous President, I believe in the rule of law—not the rule of judges. That’s why I was so pleased with the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch, a practiced and principled jurist who understands that the judge’s role is to say what the law is, not what he thinks it should be.  When Utahns first elected me to office, I swore a solemn oath to “support and defend the Constitution.” Central to that promise is confirming judges, like Neil Gorsuch, who will protect the Constitution at all costs. As your Senator, I will never waver in my commitment to defending our most basic freedoms by fighting for judges who understand their proper role under our Constitution.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatororrinhatch/videos/1420173714769036/",NA,184,145,49,23,0,4,0,29
