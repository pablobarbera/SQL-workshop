If this rule had gone into effect, farmers, small business owners, and homeowners, would have to answer to federal bureaucrats in Washington that were attempting to control ponds, streams, drainage ditches, and even puddles on their land. Needless to say, this would be devastating to our agricultural community that would be forced to spend countless resources and time applying for expensive federal permits.  I’ve voted repeatedly to stop this regulation from going into effect, and raised concerns about the harmful effect that WOTUS would have on our farmers and property owners. The efforts have paid off. Today, President Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of undoing this onerous burden. It’s great to see common sense win!","status",NA,NA,88,42,5,3,0,0,0,1

President Trump touched on a number of these issues important to Ohio’s 5th District including fixing a broken health care system, strengthening our national security, eliminating burdensome red tape, and fixing our tax code to help hardworking men and women. While the President laid out the positive measures he has taken during the first weeks of his Administration, it’s now time for the President and Congress to tackle the big issues before us.  “At home, I welcome the President’s focus on the economy and job creation. It’s no secret that many of our nation’s small businesses are being stifled by overregulation. I applaud the President’s belief that we should be reducing this burden and allowing our innovators and entrepreneurs to grow. As he mentioned, the President also remains engaged on the repeal of Obamacare and replacing it with patient-centered health care reform – an issue that Congress is working on as we speak.  “One stark contrast from the previous eight years was listening to a Commander-and-Chief make a steadfast commitment to providing our military with the resources needed to keep our country safe. Russia, China, ISIS, an emboldened Iran, and an increasingly erratic North Korea demand American leadership on the world stage. The President’s remarks in support of our troops — including the moving moment with the widow of fallen hero, Ryan Owens — show that our military and our veterans will be a priority under this Administration and this Congress. Tonight’s speech was reassuring in its promise of a strong America.”","status",NA,NA,48,16,2,6,1,0,0,4

Just yesterday, more than 70,000 Iowans found out they might not have a single insurer to purchase insurance from on their exchanges next year. Last year, more than 5.5 million people decided to pay an IRS penalty instead of purchasing insurance they can’t afford. The promises of Obamacare have been thoroughly broken, and the problems it has foisted on hardworking families can’t be ignored. Constituents in my district have told me about skyrocketing premiums, difficultly using their insurance, and the lack of choices they face thanks to Obamacare. Out of the 14 counties I represent, four are facing a reality where there won’t be a single insurer available on the exchanges, and another five counties will most likely only have one insurer available.   “The AHCA keeps in place protections for pre-existing conditions while giving states more flexibility to improve their health care marketplaces and bring down the cost of insurance. At the same time, the bill repeals Obamacare’s burdensome mandates and costly taxes that hurt Ohio families and small businesses, and it establishes a Patient and State Stability Fund that will provide funding to states so they can implement policies that work best for their citizens. The legislation also makes needed reforms to the Medicaid program while ensuring a stable transition during the implementation of the AHCA.   “Our health care system desperately needs rescuing from the disaster that is Obamacare, and that’s why I voted to pass the American Health Care Act and provide much needed relief for Ohioans.”    In addition to passing the American Health Care Act, I also voted to pass H.R. 2192, legislation that ensures that Members of Congress and congressional staff will be subject to the AHCA when it passes the Senate and is signed into law. Due to procedural issues, that legislation had to be passed as a stand-alone bill.","status",NA,NA,112,342,42,5,1,2,26,223

When a VA employee is able to stay in their role — despite gross misconduct or poor performance — it ultimately harms the veterans that have served our nation.

Everyone agrees that victims of medical malpractice deserve to be fully compensated for their damages. The problem arises when frivolous and excessive lawsuits are filed for the benefit of attorneys, not those who have been wronged. These lawsuits drive up the cost of health care for everyone as doctors are forced to spend their time practicing defensive medicine to guard against litigation, instead of doing what is best for their patients.  Unneeded tests and procedures means higher costs for patients and the health care system overall and is a drain on resources. Passing this legislation – which has been extremely successful at the state level – will save $50 billion, reduce health care costs, and continue to protect patients from medical malpractice.","link","https://latta.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398428","latta.house.gov",24,31,1,1,4,0,0,6

The three nations addressed by this legislation have flaunted international laws and each is a threat to stability around the globe.  Russia’s cyber attacks and support for the Assad regime in Syria needs to be met with additional sanctions to curb their flagrant behavior. At the same time, North Korea’s advancement of their nuclear weapons program poses a grave threat to the United States and our ally, South Korea, and Iran steadfastly violates U.N. resolutions regarding ballistic missiles.   It goes without saying that all three regimes also have atrocious human rights records. We need to hit these countries where it hurts — in their pocketbook — and provide American leadership at a time when the world desperately needs it.  The legislation, the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act, passed the House by a broad, bipartisan vote.","status",NA,NA,90,31,3,3,1,0,0,1

Mom was born to Joseph and Gertrude (Stechschulte) Kiene in 1923 on the family farm in Putnam County, Ohio. She was the second of seven children, and she learned the meaning of family and hard work while growing up on the farm. Mom graduated from Pandora High School in 1941, and during World War II she worked as a “Rosie the Riveter” at the Lima Tank Depot and later at the Bluffton Meter Works. She married my Dad, Delbert Latta, in 1948. Mom was a steadfast campaign worker for Dad, stuffing, addressing, and stamping envelopes and helping in many other ways.   Mom always had time for my sister, Rose Ellen, and me. She was an incredible pie baker, with what I considered the best, flakiest crust around!  I always told her she should enter the State Fair because she would win.  Mom always allowed us to be kids, and when we had a scrape, she was there. When I first entered school, I really didn’t want to be there. Mom would sit with me on the couch with her magnifying glass (due to her very poor eyesight) for hours, helping me learn to read.  I credit my love of reading today to my Mom’s support and guidance.   Mom loved being with family and friends.

This tax plan is a big win for Ohio's middle-class families and small businesses.  A few examples of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help:   A family of four making $59,000 a year would pay $1,182 less a year under this tax plan. That's more hard-earned money that Ohio families would get to keep.  Or, imagine a single teacher making $48,000. Thanks to the standard deduction being doubled, this teacher would see an annual tax savings of more than $1,300.  Or, think about a Main Street coffee shop that makes income of $62,000 a year. Thanks to relief provided for small businesses through a lower pass-through rate, that coffee shop will save $3,000 on their taxes. They can use that money help manage the uncertainty of owning a business or put it aside to help grow and expand.   Not to mention, most American families will be able to file their taxes on a postcard - a much easier, simpler way of filing. While this is the beginning of the process, there is a lot to like in this proposal.","link","https://fairandsimple.gop/","fairandsimple.gop",37,58,13,3,7,1,1,13

This week’s tragic attack in New York City shows that this fear is well-founded, and DHS needs to take the appropriate actions to prevent these assaults on innocent lives. I've introduced the bipartisan Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act to ensure that steps are taken — and the necessary tools are provided — to prevent these heinous attacks.  The bill directs DHS to report to Congress on their efforts to assess and prevent terrorist acts involving vehicles. Specifically, the report would include the current threat level for vehicular attacks, what the department is currently doing to prevent vehicular terrorism, how the threat can be mitigated, and a clarification on the extent to which DHS is doing outreach to private sector partners. It would also include any recommendations on what Congress can do to aid DHS efforts to prevent vehicular terrorism.","link","https://latta.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398521","latta.house.gov",13,20,2,0,0,0,0,0

Jerry McNerney (D-CA), asking for resilient technologies to be used when rebuilding grid infrastructure in disaster-stricken areas.   Currently, there is no requirement to rebuild energy infrastructure beyond pre-storm status despite the fact that many of these areas face the potential of natural disasters in the future.    The letter reads, ""The electric power grid is the backbone of the U.S. economy and society, and a reliable grid is fundamental to our day-to-day functionality and to our national security. Although much has been done to modernize the electric grid, more must be done, particularly as it relate to system resilience.  Millions of Americans are enduring the aftermath of recent wildfire and hurricanes, trying to piece back together their homes and their lives, often with an unpredictable  time frame for a solution. And while we can never fully prevent or mitigate the damage caused by natural disaster, we must focus on forward-thinking solutions that prioritize grid modernization efforts that secure our energy grid against future challenges.”  The letter continues, “During times of natural disaster the significance and necessity of the American energy grid is evident in every way, and presents us the ability to emphasize the importance of incorporating resiliency when rebuilding our grid. We encourage you to include language in supplemental appropriations bills to provide that funding should, to the extent practicable, utilize technologies to mitigate future outages and enhance resiliency of the electric grid rather than simply rebuilding to pre-event conditions.”","link","https://latta.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398548","latta.house.gov",10,16,1,0,0,0,1,1

While the Trump Administration continues to review the Iran deal, I voted to pass two pieces of bipartisan legislation that will hold the ayatollahs accountable and protect U.S. financial institutions by shining a light on the regime’s financial backing.  The Iranian Leadership Transparency Act publicizes the assets associated with Iran’s government and military leadership.  The Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act would combat the well-documented problem of Iran using civilian planes for military purposes. While the Department of Treasury had sanctioned the carrier in 2011, the Obama Administration lifted sanctions on Iran Air as part of the Iran nuclear deal. Iran Air has transported weapons to Syria, a site of civil conflict that has claimed 400,000 lives. The bill would inform Congress on financial institutions that provide funding for the export or re-export of aircraft to Iran and require Treasury to certify whether or not this financing supports Iranian terrorism or military efforts.
