For the 11 years I have served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have taken the role of “advice and consent” of State Department nominees seriously. While considering hundreds of nominations for both Democratic and Republican administrations, even where I disagreed with the nominee’s views – especially when they were just espousing the views of an administration – I have often supported them if the other qualifications of the position I considered important were met.   I respect Mr. Tillerson’s experience and willingness to serve his country, but after our private meeting and lengthy public confirmation process, I remain deeply troubled by a number of Mr. Tillerson’s responses and beliefs.    I am not convinced that Mr. Tillerson shares a worldview that the United States’ foreign policy must be rooted in the values that strengthen us as a nation: championing democracy; upholding the rule of law; and protecting human rights.  As I said during his hearing, business dealmaking is not diplomacy, and I am remain doubtful that Mr. Tillerson would fully embrace a wide-ranging policy to strengthen our alliances and forcefully confront our adversaries.    Additionally, I believe Mr. Tillerson was not entirely forthcoming in his response to my questions about both his personal and ExxonMobil’s lobbying against sanctions – one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal of peaceful diplomatic levers, and many of which I personally wrote.  If I am charged with responsibility to advise and consent, if I am to vote affirmatively for a nominee, I need honest and transparent answers.  I simply do not feel I got them from Mr. Tillerson.   Finally, as I said at the hearing, at a time when Russia’s continuing aggression around the world and interference in our election must be at the top of America’s diplomatic agenda and of chief concern to our Secretary of State, it is incredibly troublesome that Mr. Tillerson and President Trump had not discussed the specifics of their Russia policy.      Mr. Tillerson proved he lacks the sufficient knowledge or regard for the norms and necessities that so much of our modern diplomatic and security efforts depend upon, and I believe the American people deserve a chief diplomat to fully advocate for the interest and national security of all.","status",NA,NA,4378,1378,451,406,4,8,4,43

Not only is their vision for our country antithetical to everything I believe in and have fought for, I am deeply troubled by the set of alternative facts they offered to the Committee to explain their shortcomings.  If they can’t come clean and admit their mistakes, I have serious doubts whether they have the capacity in office to tell the American public the truth.    Mr. Mnunchin’s entire career can be effectively summarized in one line: privatizing profits and socializing losses.  From his days at Goldman Sachs on the front lines of developing the very products that brought our economy to its knees, to his reign as Chairman of OneWest Bank foreclosing on tens of thousands of homeowners throughout the country, Mr. Mnuchin has exploited this nation’s financial turmoil to pad his own bank account at the expense of hardworking American families.   Mr. Mnuchin has the audacity to call OneWest a ‘loan modification machine’ and portray himself as a hero when his bank repeatedly denied modification applications and aggressively pursued foreclosures against hardworking New Jersey families, servicemembers and seniors.  In the darkest days of the financial crisis—when Rome was burning—Mr. Mnuchin and his friends were looking for stores to raid and homeowners to stiff.   Mr. Mnuchin is nominated to serve in a position to ensure the financial stability of the American economy, but his only experience is betting on the financial instability of American families.  His top priority is to roll back the very Wall Street reform laws that protect taxpayers and homeowners from risky, predatory, and exploitative practices by financial firms.  Hardworking New Jerseyans can’t afford four years of Mr. Mnuchin and his friends profiteering at their expense.  In Rep. Price, we have a man who has spent his entire political career working to undermine the foundation of America’s health care system by pushing to end Medicare and Medicaid as we know it, leaving tens of millions of seniors and low-income families across the country without access to care.  He fundamentally does not believe that health care is a right for all citizens, and instead wants to eliminate the entitlement, which takes away the guarantee of health care and turns it into only a possibility.   These are very troubling positions that will have widespread implications on the 1.5 million New Jersey seniors on Medicare who would see drastic increases in out-of-pocket costs, and the 1.8 million low-income men, women and children who would lose their Medicaid coverage.  And when I asked him pointblank during his confirmation hearing, Rep. Price lied about his own record.

The Attorney General of the United States is a position of vital importance to our nation, entrusted to individuals who will pursue justice for all regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, age, gender or disability.  Charged with enforcing our nation’s laws without prejudice, the Attorney General must be a protector of civil rights, civil liberties, religious freedoms, voting rights, and immigrant rights.  Senator Sessions’ focus on law and order is certainly a valuable attribute expected of an Attorney General, but I am not convinced he’s as committed to becoming the steadfast zealot our nation needs when it comes to defending civil rights, combatting voter suppression, and standing up for immigrant, LGBTQ and women’s rights.

Andrew Puzder’s abhorrent treatment of his workers is incredibly concerning.  As a fast food giant, he has played fast and loose with U.S. labor laws.  He has fought against a living wage and strengthening overtime rules, and even advocated for replacing human workers with robots.  He has single-handedly helped to grow America’s class of working poor and food insecure, while blaming the very government programs and protections that keep hard-working families from falling even further behind.   Andrew Puzder is no more equipped to lead the federal agency responsible for protecting American workers from abusive employers than the fox is guarding the hen house.  I therefore cannot support his nomination to be Secretary of Labor.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatormenendez/photos/a.428999531357.204054.349744811357/10154969558151358/?type=3",NA,187,57,16,14,1,0,1,12

In fact, his nomination is antithetical to the very mission of the EPA, and is dangerous to our planet and the health of every single person on it.  As Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt acted as if his job was to shield polluting corporations rather than to protect the public interest. He used his power to help polluters by trying to dismantle every protection we have for clean air and clean water.  He sued the EPA repeatedly to allow more mercury in your air and more chemicals in your water because that’s what corporate interests told him to do.  He has refused to answer questions from Congress about these dubious dealings, which signals his plan to continue being a shill for polluters once at the EPA.  Scott Pruitt’s record harkens back to a time when rivers caught fire from pollution, smog blanketed our cities, and corporations dumped toxic waste freely throughout our communities.  We are all healthier and safer because of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the protections of the EPA, but Scott Pruitt’s nomination puts all of that at risk.  The EPA is particularly critical in New Jersey, as we work to address lead hazards, expedite cleanups of toxic waste sites through the Superfund program, and protect our residents from air pollution from neighboring states.  I do not understand how Scott Pruitt can effectively lead an agency charged with protecting the environment when he spent his career protecting polluters.  His record tells me that he has no intention of carrying out the EPA’s mission; instead he will attempt to sabotage the very department he’s been asked to lead. Therefore, I will vote against his nomination.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatormenendez/photos/a.428999531357.204054.349744811357/10154974328376358/?type=3",NA,762,155,61,63,1,1,3,9

Contrary to President Trump’s promise of lower costs for all Americans, today’s report also reveals massive health insurance premium hikes for consumers across the board – and especially older Americans approaching retirement. Under this plan, a 64 year-old worker earning $26,500 a year would see their costs increase by an unfathomable 760 percent.  It also slashes nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid, leaving states with no choice but to kick pregnant women, children,  Americans with disabilities, and seniors in nursing homes out of the system.

In beginning to roll back the EPA’s fuel economy standards, President Trump is asking the average American to purchase a huge gift for Big Oil companies. High fuel economy standards simply mean that Americans’ cars get more miles per gallon, saving money for families and keeping our air clean. Rolling back these standards will force Americans to spend more time at the gas station, doling out their hard-earned money to oil giants who are already overcharging them.   These kinds of policies are exactly what I warned could happen if Scott Pruitt became EPA Administrator given his close ties to the fossil fuel industry.

I take my Constitutional obligation to advise and consent very seriously, because the decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court affect the lives of every single American.    I had hoped President Trump would nominate an uncontroversial, mainstream judge to the Supreme Court.  Instead, he has chosen a nominee who, after long reflection and in hearing from my constituents, I cannot support.    In his writings and his career, Judge Neil Gorsuch has shown himself to be far too close to powerful corporations and special interests.  I am particularly concerned by his dissent in TransAm Trucking v. Administrative Review Board, where a trucker driving in negative-14 degrees lost the use of his trailer’s brakes.  When the employer fired the trucker for abandoning the trailer to find heat to save his life, six other judges made the obvious and commonsense conclusion that that firing was illegal.  But Judge Gorsuch would have upheld the firing based on an illogical and indefensible reading of the underlying law.  Other areas of Judge Gorsuch’s record also deeply concern me.  He praised one of the main architects of the voter identification laws, which are stripping rights away from African-American and Latino voters.  He held that corporations’ religious rights trump a female employee’s right to contraceptive care.  He has even taken extraordinary measures to advance his own ideological views and undermine women’s access to basic reproductive health care when he requested a sua sponte rehearing in a case that would have blocked funding to Planned Parenthood.     I asked myself whether Judge Gorsuch would further the ideal of equal justice and give full meaning to our nation’s civil rights laws, and whether he would uphold these principles in the face of the current anti-civil rights, anti-immigrant, anti-women and anti-human rights agenda.  During his hearing, I had hoped that he would be forthright in his answers, explaining his judicial philosophy while maintaining the future impartiality that all judges must possess.  Unfortunately, I found Judge Gorsuch’s answers at the hearing to be wholly inadequate.    Based on his record, judicial philosophy, and indirect and evasive answers during the hearings, I cannot support either cloture or final passage on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination.  The last four judges confirmed to the Supreme Court received more than 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, and there is no reason that Neil Gorsuch shouldn’t be held to the same standard.  Instead of changing the rules on lifetime appointments that have made the Senate the greatest deliberative body, we should instead work together in a bipartisan manner to find a nominee who is capable of winning a healthy majority in the U.S. Senate.","status",NA,NA,2401,868,410,211,6,7,4,20

Last night's air strikes targeting the launch site of those chemical weapons sent a message to Assad and to the world that using chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians is a gross violation of international law that will have consequences.    As I did when Assad first used chemical weapons against his own population in 2013, I believe this heinous act merited an international response. As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee then, I worked with a bipartisan group of senators to authorize the use of military force for the purpose of getting rid of Assad’s chemical weapons. Evidently, Syria has violated their obligations under that agreement to fully do so.     As we consider further response to Assad’s brutal actions, we must also look at those actors complicit in his years of carnage, including Vladimir Putin in Russia. President Trump must also be prepared to address Russia’s role in this horrific conflict as well. Unless we change Russia and Iran’s commitment to propping up Assad, the slaughter will continue.   Lastly, this latest chemical attack should serve as a gruesome reminder to the Trump administration of the horror in this brutal conflict, which has led to the worst refugee crisis since World War II.  The United States has always been a beacon of hope for those fleeing persecution and violence, and bombs alone will not bring about a resolution.  We must also have a humane refugee policy as this humanitarian disaster continues to unfold.","status",NA,NA,235,79,23,7,0,0,10,19

We in the United States mourn alongside the grieving families who have lost their loved ones and all of Egypt as the country faces these attacks together. My thoughts and prayers are also with the Coptic community, including the large and thriving diaspora in New Jersey, for both the loss of life and for the further loss of religious freedom suffered by fellow Christians in Egypt. These acts of violence are unforgivable and only serve to prolong the day when religious minorities can live without fear and uncertainty from barbaric terrorism for practicing their faith.   As the peaceful Egyptian Coptic community mourns, heals and begins to rebuild their places of worship, the government must protect them and all minorities from any and all injustice and intolerance simply because of their Christian beliefs. After his recent visit to the White House and Capitol Hill where we discussed our shared goals of defeating ISIS and closing off the region to extremists and terrorism, President al-Sisi’s commitment to the safety and security of the Coptic community in his country must be a critical factor in the way the United States supports and assists the Egyptian government.

And for millions of women with employer-sponsored health benefits, the law barred insurers from charging higher premiums for the same plans offered to men. It also guaranteed coverage for essential health benefits, like maternity and newborn care, preventative screenings, prescription drugs, treatment for mental illness and substance abuse, visits to specialists, and more.

Any updated NAFTA must strengthen labor standards and make them enforceable, and above all, raise wages here at home. I find it incredible that after so much talk on the campaign trail and over 100 days in office, the Administration has still not laid out the specific changes it wants to make to the deal, and how those changes will help grow middle class incomes.    As we move forward, I hope the Administration will closely consult with me and my colleagues in Congress to make sure that any new deal doesn’t repeat the same mistakes made in TPP.

But tax cuts for the wealthy won’t close our skills gap, or train the long-term unemployed, or build the cutting-edge infrastructure our businesses deserve.   Rather than put forward a plan to revitalize our cities, create better-paying jobs, or help more Americans get ahead, this budget adds billions of dollars to our bloated defense budget while sacrificing the very things that make America worth fighting for.    The answer to the financial insecurity that many working families feel is not to make college more expensive, or to kick poor people off Medicaid, or zero-out job-creating investments in our communities.   We cannot be the great land of opportunity or the world’s most innovative economy if we slash funding for lifesaving medical research, zero-out programs that bring capital to underserved communities, or abandon big-thinking infrastructure projects like Gateway.

And it still ends federally-guaranteed coverage for essential health benefits that all families depend on, from hospital stays and prescription drug coverage to maternity care and mental health and substance abuse treatment.

It signals to the world that in the face of collective challenges, the U.S. will choose a path of isolation rather than engagement, based on a willful denial of fact.  By capitulating to the demands of fringe voices who reject science and promote reliance on the dirty energy sources of the past, the United States is abdicating our leadership and our responsibility to be stewards of the environment.   Americans from all walks of life understand that the threat posed by climate change is real, and understand the consequences of doing nothing—rising seas, stronger storms, famine and drought, and increased political instability throughout the world.  They also understand the economic opportunity of taking action, embracing innovation, and building the clean energy economy of the future.  It was this consensus that created a global response to climate change, and it is this wisdom that can preserve our planet and protect future generations.   Turning back the clock on environmental progress and risking our future for the benefit of polluting corporations is not a solution. The fight against climate change requires real leadership and political courage—the kind demonstrated by 197 nations when they signed the Paris agreement. Today’s news is a setback, but I will never stop fighting for real solutions to address the threat of climate change.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatormenendez/photos/a.428999531357.204054.349744811357/10155309650686358/?type=3",NA,414,143,96,3,9,2,94,94

I vividly remember the images on the news and the horrible sinking of my heart as we realized the gunman targeted an LGBTQ club. Nearly all of those killed were LGBTQ, more than half of the victims were part of Central Florida's vibrant Puerto Rican diaspora. The LGBTQ community was heartbroken. The Latino community was shaken. And our entire nation was at yet another crossroads when it came to the issue of gun violence.   One year later, our nation’s wounds have yet to heal, and we have yet to take meaningful action to honor the victims. The Pulse nightclub shooting was the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter in American history, and despite Democratic filibusters and sit-ins, Congressional Republicans have spent the last year blocking common sense gun reform. I’m talking about background checks. I’m talking about banning large ammunition magazines designed for shooting en masse. These are simply common-sense reforms. They are not controversial, they will protect the most vulnerable among us, and they do not violate the Second Amendment.   How many prayers must be said? How many vigils must we have? How many moments of silence before we get serious about stopping gun violence in this country? Inaction is acceptance. I hope my Republican colleagues can get serious soon, before more tragedy strikes.","status",NA,NA,167,58,25,6,0,0,83,6

But it doesn’t matter which bill is better or worse, because the American people still lose.    We have just one week to stop a Republican plan that strips coverage from millions of Americans, hikes premiums for middle-class and working people, guts the guarantee of essential benefits, disproportionately hurts women and the disabled, and forces the most vulnerable to pay for a massive tax cut for the richest among us.      Thousands of middle-class New Jerseyans who buy insurance on the private marketplace won’t get any help with their premiums. And families with insurance will have to pay higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for what, at the end of the day, is less comprehensive coverage.     This cruel and heartless legislation leaves millions of Americans who rely on the Medicaid expansion – including over half-a-million New Jerseyans – with no options at all.  And the damage doesn’t stop there, as the Medicaid program that pays for two-out-of-three seniors’ home care and helps Americans with disabilities live their lives with dignity is cut by hundreds of billions of dollars.    The Republican plan has nothing to do with making health care affordable for more Americans. It’s nothing more than an enormous tax giveaway to the nation’s richest Americans paid for by taking healthcare away from those who need it most.","status",NA,NA,390,180,142,9,3,4,44,163

The repression, violence, and outright crimes committed by the Maduro government and his state-sanctioned thugs, has hit a new low today and the world community cannot afford to stand idly by in the face of such deplorable display of force and brutality.  While the streets of Venezuela have been inundated for months by alarming levels of violence and crime, sky-high inflation rates, and the scarcity of food and basic consumer goods, Maduro has shamelessly confirmed once again that he is willing to stop at nothing to consolidate his power. Not satisfied removing checks on the executive, jailing opposition leaders indefinitely, corrupting the judiciary and the rule of law, politicizing the military and suppressing freedom of the press, the regime has now authorized the attack and siege of the last line of defense in the opposition-controlled legislature.  As a nation that believes in the sacredness of democratic principles, rule of law and basic human rights, I call on the Trump administration to recognize the tremendous stake we have in the situation in Venezuela, and its obligation to act decisively and without ambiguity.

The international community must not be bullied by the Maduro regime any more.  It's time for the hemisphere to lay out a strategy that will end this brutality and bring peace to Venezuela.     The people of Venezuela, repressed and now under direct attack from their own government, are suffering and desperately need our help. This is -- at the end of the day -- a national security issue that we must approach in a spirit of unprecedented unity. The carnage by this unhinged dictator must be stopped at once, and today’s violence against the elected representatives of the Venezuelan people only prove that Maduro will not hesitate to threaten regional stability to get his way.","status",NA,NA,123,72,36,0,1,2,36,16

It’s time for Republicans to listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want them to abandon their cruel, misguided and partisan repeal effort once and for all.  This latest proposal is like a splash of cologne on a skunk; it still stinks.  It eviscerates the guarantee of coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions while forcing consumers into bare-bones plans that fail to cover essential benefits like hospital stays, visits to specialists, prescription drugs, prenatal care, mental health treatment, and more.  Without the guarantee of coverage for essential benefits like addiction treatment and mental health care, the added funding fails to provide the resources needed to tackle New Jersey’s and nation’s opioid epidemic.  The bill still imposes a punishing age-tax on middle-aged Americans while saddling working families with higher premiums and deductibles; eliminates the Medicaid expansion that gave millions of low-wage workers – including over half a million New Jerseyans – access to basic care for the first time; and ends the federal Medicaid guarantee as we know it, forcing states to abandon seniors in nursing homes and Americans with disabilities who rely on long-term care.

Congressional Republicans find themselves at another critical junction where they can put country over party by refusing to stand on the sidelines of this president’s self-destructive behavior. Make no mistake, history is on our side and it is my sincere hope Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan allow us to swiftly vote on a bill that enshrines legal protections for our DREAMers without any unrelated provisions or poison pills. I personally worked for years to convince the Obama administration to create the DACA program and I refuse to let its beneficiaries be further victimized in the name of nativist fear mongering. Now is not the time to sit idly by hoping extremists catch up with reality; it is time for elected leaders to do our job, stand up and protect those who cannot protect themselves.    The story of DACA is a story I’ve come to tell with a great sense of pride and patriotism. After years of fearless advocacy, the government asked young DREAMers for their trust and faith. Since then, hundreds of thousands of DREAMers have been coming out of the shadows, passing criminal background checks, paying fees, and despite their natural human instinct for protection, voluntarily handing over personal information about themselves and their families to authorities they had been forced to hide from for most of their lives. These promising individuals trusted their government to acquire two-year renewable work permits and receive what they thought was protection from deportation. Now, half a decade since its implementation, DACA is universally accepted as an overwhelming success, a beacon of hope and an example to follow in solving our immigration challenge. And yet, here we are.  To all of the DREAMers this program helped bring out of the shadows – the 800,000 young men and women who came to this country as children through no fault of their own: Please stay strong and know you are not alone. Your fear is real but so is your resilience. Time will prove the actions of this President wrong, but we must fight now with the same vigor and strength that convinced President Obama to take action in 2012 and create DACA in the first place.  I have never doubted you will help lead this nation into a brighter, more prosperous, more productive future and we need you to keep the dream alive. Let us use this tough moment to better educate those who refuse to understand what the immigrant experience, immigrant history, and immigrant heritage means to the progress of this nation. You have a lifelong ally in me. Your courage, your dedication and your resolve will continue to keep America great.","status",NA,NA,685,440,170,20,5,7,142,171

A half-a-million New Jerseyans covered under Medicaid expansion—many of whom work low-wage jobs that don’t provide health benefits—will once again find themselves uninsured and with no other option.  This bill punishes Medicaid expansion states while rewarding states that did nothing to help their citizens gain coverage, ends Medicaid as we know it by radically restructuring the federal-state partnership into a block grant, and will cost New Jersey billions in lost federal funding.    Republicans like to say a block grant would give states more choice over how to run Medicaid, but for states like New Jersey it would not only cost us more, but harm children with disabilities, single moms, and seniors with long-term care needs like M.S. and Alzheimer’s disease.  It’s infuriating to see Republicans unite around a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act just as the U.S. Census Bureau confirms that it has helped more New Jerseyans get covered than ever before, and we need to work harder than ever to defend the historic gains we’ve made.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatormenendez/photos/a.428999531357.204054.349744811357/10155670090986358/?type=3",NA,325,386,416,11,15,10,126,398

This is how Republicans are making it harder to seek justice from corporations like Equifax and Wells Fargo:  Currently, financial institutions can use arbitration clauses (what I think should be called a #RipOffClause) to ban you from joining a class-action lawsuit against them. So without the threat of a major lawsuit, Wells Fargo opened millions of fake accounts for their customers which racked up millions in fees. Even after the Wells Fargo scandal became public, they used a #RipOffClause to deprive customers of their day in court. And, Wells Fargo continues to use a #RipOffClause to squash customer lawsuits on unfair overdraft fees.  Worse over, financial institutions use #RipOffClause to strip military servicemembers of their right to justice: https://medium.com/@lflange/i-served-to-protect-our-rights-dont-let-equifax-take-them-away-8de7af56be56  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), supported by many of us Democrats in Congress, rightfully banned the #RipOffClause for the financial sector to protect consumer's rights, but today, GOP is trying to repeal that rule. They think Americans should be denied their right to a day in court when Big Banks don’t play by the rules. But without the threat of a massive lawsuit, financial institutions are free to continue to defraud their customers with no accountability. Especially after latest Equifax data breach, it is just common sense to support the CFPB rule.","status",NA,NA,81,86,40,0,4,4,7,64

Th Trump Administration's decision to terminate the program for Nicaraguans goes against those very principles by unilaterally upending the lives of approximately 5,300 Nicaraguans who have legally lived in the U.S. for nearly twenty years, making them a future target for deportation.  This ill-advised announcement will also punish many U.S. citizen children whose American families will now be torn apart by the Trump administration’s mass deportation force. Let us be clear, stripping the legal status of law-abiding immigrants flies in the face of being ‘tough on illegal immigration’.    Additionally, the Administration’s non-decision on renewing TPS for Honduras automatically triggered a six-month extension which strings along approximately 86,000 Hondurans across our country.  People should not have to live their lives in six month increments. DHS must acknowledge the dire conditions in Honduras clearly warrant extending TPS protections to them.  Revoking TPS only strips legal status from entire communities, forces them into the shadows of society, and subjects law-abiding immigrants to deportation. And with more TPS extension deadlines coming up for other countries, the stakes couldn’t be more clear. I am prepared to fight every step of the way until the White House drops their attacks on immigrant families, stops self-inflicting wounds to our moral standing as a nation, and finally listens to those of us who understand immigration is a part of what makes America great.","status",NA,NA,87,116,19,6,7,2,13,18

I have always believed that our tax code needs simplification for small businesses and middle class families, which is why I am on the Senate Finance Committee, and why I accepted the appointment to the Conference Committee.  But Republicans made it crystal clear from day one that they weren’t serious about a real effort to reform the code so that it works better. This entire process was rigged. The fact is they never had any intention of working in a bipartisan manner to reform our tax system and instead wrote a plan that brazenly benefits corporate special interests at the expense of New Jersey families.     Next week Republicans are poised to pass their partisan tax bill that takes billions of dollars from hardworking families in New Jersey by gutting the state and local tax deduction my constituents rely on to deduct a combined $34 billion every year. Meanwhile, our children get stuck with the trillions in debt and these so-called deficit hawks an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   New Jerseyans can’t afford to subsidize the rest of the country more than they already do, and this highway robbery threatens to drive down home values and decimate the ability of our state to invest in public schools, infrastructure, law enforcement, and other vital economic priorities.","status",NA,NA,237,212,93,1,8,0,52,178
