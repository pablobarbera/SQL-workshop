Keep in mind, Congress already has the power to repeal regulations one by one. But this reaches far beyond that‚ÄîRepublicans in Congress want to be able to bundle all the regulations they don‚Äôt like and be able to repeal them with just one vote.   Lots of regulations are being targeted‚Äîincluding ones that limit methane emissions into the air, establish fair and safe protections for workers, keep states from blocking access to women‚Äôs reproductive health, and protect students. These regulations have gone through a long, extensive public process before being finalized.  Just to be clear, I‚Äôve often worked to change regulations that I felt have needlessly burden people and businesses in Maine. But if Congress wants to change regulations, it should give us the chance to adequately debate the merits of each and get feedback from our constituents. I don‚Äôt think the Republicans in Congress should have the right to unilaterally erase the last few months of President Obama‚Äôs tenure.    I‚Äôll be voting against this legislation.","status",NA,NA,603,177,118,26,1,4,6,81

Over the last week, I‚Äôve been saddened and disturbed by attempts by the Ku Klux Klan to recruit members in Freeport and Augusta, and by a hate crime against a group of high school students in Portland. I am appalled that anyone would try to spread these hateful ideas here in Maine‚Äîhowever they are a painful reminder that the fight for equality is as important now as it was decades ago. I am proud that more than 200 Mainers came together last week in Freeport to speak out against racism and the KKK.  Before slavery was abolished in 1865, hundreds of Mainers opened their homes and congregations to slaves as part of the Underground Railroad, and many more lost their lives fighting in the Civil War. During the civil rights movement, Mainers volunteered to travel to southern states to register African-Americans to vote. And today a new generation of activists are continuing to remind us that the fight for racial justice is not over. Throughout, Maine has held a proud tradition of upholding and fighting for civil rights and I am hopeful it will continue.","link","https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-pingrees-statement-black-history-month","pingree.house.gov",66,4,7,4,1,0,0,0

What‚Äôs worse is that this plan is paid for on the backs of seniors and older Americans, who will see a dramatic increase in costs which could put insurance out of reach for many. Under the ACA, a 64-year old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 in premiums in 2026, but under the GOP plan, the same person would pay $14,600 ‚Äì an astonishing spike of more than 750%.  Thanks to the ACA, older Americans have better access to quality care, but these gains will be lost under the GOP plan which costs Americans more, and offers them less. In particular, this plan harms older Mainers by:                            Charging more for premiums ‚Äì The Republican plan increases the amount that insurance companies can charge 50-64 year olds up to 5 times more. While current law does allow for ‚Äúage rating‚Äù of 3:1, AARP estimates that increasing this to 5:1 could result in premium spikes of up to $3,200 for a 64 year old.                                                                                Rolling back Medicaid ‚Äì Not only does the Republican plan put an end to state Medicaid expansion opportunities, it sets a limit on the federal contribution for each enrollee. These arbitrary ‚Äúper capita caps‚Äù mean that states won‚Äôt be able to increase coverage when populations increase, or to add new benefits, or to increase payments to providers when needed.  This approach is a dramatic cost shift to states, where budgets are already constrained, and will result in drastic cuts for older Americans who are low-income, disabled, or needing long term care.   Depleting the Medicare Trust Fund ‚Äì The ACA helped to extend the life of the Medicare Part A (hospital coverage) Trust Fund. The Republican plan includes a number of tax breaks for the wealthy, including a $117 billion cut that will potentially reduce the life of the Trust Fund by 2 to 4 years.   Since the enactment of the ACA, the number of uninsured American ages 50-64 has dropped by half.  Of the 85,000 Mainers enrolled on the Health Insurance Marketplace, a full third are in the 50s and 60s. And of course, a vast number of older Mainers depend on Medicare and Medicaid for their health care. All of this is threatened by the Republican health care plan that appears to be nothing more than a shameful attempt to keep a campaign promise. Older Americans have and continue to give us so much; they deserve greater certainty in knowing that we will protect quality, affordable health care for when they need it most.

For those of us who know the impact these domestic cuts will have on the communities we serve, President Trump‚Äôs budget proposal is dead on arrival.   Moreover, as a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, I am appalled by President Trump's proposed budget for the U.S. Department of Agriculture which would cripple this agency with a 29 percent cut from the agency's enacted fiscal year 2016 budget. Slashing all discretionary funds from Rural Business and Cooperative Services will only stifle economic development in rural America and harm the very communities that the President claims to support. Farmers in Maine and across the country benefit greatly from Value Added Producer Grants, the Rural Energy for America Program, and military veteran farmer trainings organized by ATTRA. Field office staff are USDA's boots on the ground providing farmers with essential technical assistance and outreach, yet President Trump wants to cut these positions which have an enormous impact in rural communities.","link","http://www.sunjournal.com/news/maine/0001/11/30/trumps-budget-fails-impress-sen-angus-king-or-rep-chellie-pingree/2095573","sunjournal.com",370,78,56,31,1,1,1,36

""Trumpcare is Robin Hood in reverse. It takes health care dollars away from poor, rural, and older Americans in order to give tax breaks to insurance companies, drug companies and the wealthiest Americans. The numbers are simply staggering. Trumpcare will give insurance companies a $145 billion tax break and require individuals who have a gap in their coverage to pay a 30 percent premium surcharge to the insurance company for a year. It will reduce taxes on drug companies by $15 billion and give top earners a $158 billion windfall.  At the same time, the CBO estimates that a 64-year-old man earning $26,500 a year who previously paid $1,700 for his coverage will pay $14,600 under Trumpcare ‚Äî that‚Äôs more than half his income. Inexplicably, Trumpcare also strips federal funding for Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide basic health care services to thousands of low-income Mainers and millions of Americans nationwide.""","link","http://www.pressherald.com/2017/03/22/rep-chellie-pingree-passing-trumpcare-would-take-us-backward/","pressherald.com",273,52,80,17,0,2,0,6

In House negotiations, I strongly advocated for several key programs to be funded in the final bill. Some of the programs that are of particular importance to Maine include:  * $3 billion for Community Development Block Grants (CBDG). Maine received $16 million in CDBG grants last year to support job creation, community development, and infrastructure improvements.  * An additional $150 million for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grants to address opioid and heroin abuse nationwide. This along with $500 million for 21st Century Cures to stem drug abuse and spur drug innovation which will help many Maine families struggling with the opioid crisis.  *$2 million in additional funding for for The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and National Endowment for Humanities (NEH) grants. These grants have supported over 100 programs in Maine in the past five years.  *$15 million for the Value Added Producer Grant Program, which is a $4.25 million increase from FY16. VAPG provides funding to farmers who want to process or market new products. In 2015 & 2016, 13 Maine farmers were awarded a total of $1.6 million for VAPG projects.   *Full funding for an additional DDG-51 ship to be built at Bath Iron Works.  *$2 billion in additional National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, which supports the development of treatments and cures for patients and related research at numerous locations across the state of Maine including the University of New England, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, and Jackson Lab.   *The omnibus spending bill also allows the Trump Administration to raise the cap on H-2B visas, up to 70,000 additional visas for this fiscal year. The program is critical for employers in Maine who need to fill their seasonal hospitality positions each year.   https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pingree-votes-secure-vital-funding-maine-avoid-government-shutdown","link","https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pingree-votes-secure-vital-funding-maine-avoid-government-shutdown","pingree.house.gov",58,11,6,7,0,0,0,1

In Maine, we‚Äôve seen the consequences of starving the social safety net of funding‚ÄîMainers have gone hungry, our state‚Äôs opioid epidemic has worsened, and for the first time in years, the infant mortality rate has increased.    Cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, Social Security programs, and LIHEAP will devastate families across our state who rely on these programs to survive. At the same time, this budget cuts other programs that help Americans succeed. From slashing student loan relief to zeroing out rural infrastructure programs, the Trump Administration is out of touch with the challenges of hardworking Americans.   The fact is that 1 in 7 Mainers rely on SNAP benefits to put meals on the table; student loan relief is a necessity for millions of Americans because the cost of higher education is out of reach for working families; and Medicaid is a lifeline for Mainers seeking to age with dignity in long-term care facilities, those with disabilities, and low-income children, families, and veterans.    President Trump has presented an infeasible plan that strips away foundational programs in order to build an unnecessary border wall and provide tax giveaways to millionaires, for which our grandkids will pay for decades to come. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will be asking his administration how on earth they can justify this egregious disregard for the realities of the American people.

Today we learned from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the true cost of TrumpCare holds no one harmless ‚Äî from outright eliminating coverage for 23 million Americans to making it wholly unaffordable to those who need it most. Now that House Republicans know the actual consequences of their votes, I hope they will denounce TrumpCare and urge their Senate colleagues to be more responsible with the health care of millions of Americans.   Additionally, House Republicans and the Trump Administration continue to create uncertainty within the nation‚Äôs health care industry‚Äî and it will cause harm to consumers, providers, and insurers.  Instead of focusing on ways to strengthen the health insurance market and protect Americans from high costs, President Trump has spent months threatening to upend the market altogether. This week, the White House continued to promote uncertainty by pushing off its decision to fund Cost Sharing Reduction Payments (CSRs) for another 90 days. These payments are essential to ensuring that families can afford their plans on the individual market, and insurers have been clear that, should CSRs not be funded, they will be forced to raise premiums and perhaps leave the market altogether.   And on top of all this, yesterday President Trump proposed a budget that will only hurt Mainers and their access to health care. Medicaid, which covers nearly a quarter of Mainers, is gutted by an additional $610 billion over ten years, on top of over $834 billion in cuts included in TrumpCare. Planned Parenthood, which provides millions of low-income women, men, and families with basic health care every year, is stripped of all federal funding. We cannot let this stand.   Playing politics with the health of millions of Americans is simply unacceptable.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/cbo-congressional-budget-office-health-care.html","nytimes.com",54,35,20,1,0,2,12,53

You deserve to know how these backroom decisions stand to impact the health and livelihood of your family.

We could see the return of annual and lifetime caps, even for those with insurance through their employer.   And for what? Billions in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and insurance companies.

This bill was crafted in back rooms with an incredible lack of transparency.  2) Fundamentally alters the Medicaid program--capping state assistance and eliminating coverage, endangering necessary services for children, elderly, and the disabled. Our hospitals, nursing homes, and schools will all be harmed.  3) Allows insurance companies to charge older enrollees 5 times more for premiums than younger enrollees on the individual market, essentially an age tax.  4) Makes it possible for insurance companies to sell plans that don‚Äôt cover Essential Health Benefits--a backhand way of weakening protections for pre-existing conditions and potentially reinstating annual and lifetime caps.  5) Slashes tax credits for many on the exchange, primarily low-income and older Mainers. According to one estimate, a 60-year-old Portland resident earning $44,000 a year could pay $9,290 more in premiums.  6) Defunds Planned Parenthood, where millions of Americans receive reproductive and preventive health care.  7) Eliminates assistance for small businesses to cover their employees after 2019.  8) Repeals the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Maine has received $39 million to support fights against diabetes and obesity.     9) Allows insurance companies to offer less valuable coverage on the exchange--meaning you could pay more out-of-pocket for deductibles and co-pays.   10) Finally--and most importantly for Republican leadership--the bill amounts to a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and insurance company CEOs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/ChelliePingree/photos/a.175015577807.121800.91529332807/10155360053637808/?type=3",NA,89,62,144,1,2,3,23,108

Last year, more than half of all Mainers enrolled in the marketplace received CSRs, averaging $1,160 annually.    President Trump has indicated his plans to sabotage the viability of the Affordable Care Act by ending CSR payments, which are paid automatically and directly from the federal government to insurers on behalf of individuals. If these payments are discontinued, the impact will cause significant harm - on the nearly 47,000 Mainers who rely on them, their providers, and the health care industry as a whole, which makes up 1/6 of our national economy.   The Affordable Care Act can and must be improved, but blowing up a key component of our health care system is not a solution. We must come together meet to address the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act without cutting off coverage for millions by making it completely unaffordable. I am encouraged that some Senate and House Republicans have expressed an interest in saving CSRs for the sake of market stabilization and I hope they will urge President Trump to uphold these payments, too.   The next CSR payments are due to be issued on August 21st. Soon after, in early September, both the Senate Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions (HELP) committee and Senate Finance committee will start bipartisan hearings on market stabilization. If President Trump is not willing to use his authority to fund CSRs, Congress must work in a bipartisan fashion to guarantee these payments going forward. It is urgent that we bring needed security to the health care market and to the consumers whose access to care is on the line.","status",NA,NA,70,39,13,0,0,0,5,25

The Forever GI Bill is similar to The Chris Kotch Act, which I introduced in the previous two Congresses and named after a Purple Heart recipient from Brunswick, Maine who was denied his full GI benefits because of a loophole.   A member of the Army Reserve, Chris Kotch served on active duty for five months in Iraq before being seriously injured by an IED in 2003. He was sent to Walter Reed Hospital but was not officially discharged until he reported back to his Reserve unit.  While Kotch was medically retired as a result of his combat injuries‚Äîwhich should have made him eligible for the full benefit‚Äîhis discharge paperwork says he simply finished his active duty obligation.   Because of that wording‚Äîbecause Chris was temporarily transferred from active duty service back to the Reserves before being discharged‚Äîthe Department of Veterans Affairs said Chris wasn‚Äôt eligible for the full benefit and instead would only receive a portion.  Chris, who recently graduated with a master‚Äôs in social work, told me, ""It was a pretty discouraging and degrading experience to have to fight for a benefit that should have been a given; to call agency after agency only to be told that there was nothing they could do. The issue didn‚Äôt stop me from pursuing my education, but it did mean that I had to take out loans when I shouldn‚Äôt have had to. I appreciate that veterans in my kind of situation will no longer have to fight for their education.‚Äù    Signed into law earlier this week, The Harry W.

Last June, in the wake of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, House Democrats demanded action on common-sense gun legislation. I sat with my Democratic colleagues on the floor of the U.S. House and said no one else should die at the hands of a reckless gunman because of Congressional inaction. Republicans blocked our effort and never allowed for debate on the bill. More than a year later, the nation is reeling from the most devastating mass shooting in modern history with no sign of a safer tomorrow.    Four out of five Americans support universal background checks, so why won't Congress listen to their constituents and pass a bill to prevent weapons from getting into the hands of irresponsible gun owners once again? Recently, House Republicans have pushed to take up bills that would reduce restrictions on silencers and allow greater access to armor piercing bullets. Not only are these bills completely out of touch, they would make it more difficult to know where gunshots are being fired and put law enforcement officers in danger.    Enough is enough.   Unless Congress stands on the side of public safety to pass common-sense gun legislation now, what happened in Las Vegas today could happen anywhere in America tomorrow.

They told me, ""she might not be dead if there had been a background check.‚Äù  Their daughter Darien was my constituent. She was 25, had recently graduated from college, and was working in Portland. At 1:30am in January of 2010, masked gunmen burst into her apartment and shot her several times in her own bed as she lay sleeping.  The gun that killed Darien could not be traced and the investigation of Darien's homicide went cold. To this day, it remains unsolved in part because no background check was done, no records were kept, and the seller claims not to remember who he sold it to or what day he sold it. Sadly, this is all perfectly legal under current law.  It is hard for me to imagine what it is to lose a child‚Äîespecially to a senseless act of gun violence. The ""what-ifs"" and the ""whys"" must haunt you for the rest of your life. And because Congress has failed, again and again, to even consider background checks for private gun sales, thousands more families will live their lives wondering if our failure to act in Washington led to the loss of their child.  As Wayne Richardson has said ""nobody is taking anyone's guns away.‚Äù Darien‚Äôs parents just ask that we pass common-sense gun laws.  Tomorrow, December 14th marks the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which took the lives of 20 innocent children and six brave educators.
