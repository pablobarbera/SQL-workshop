Despite the Republican leadership’s claims to the contrary, it’s clear: after losing by a historic margin of over 3 million votes, Trump has no mandate to lead.       • No mandate to throw millions of Americans off of their health care.       • No mandate for tax giveaways to the richest Americans.       • No mandate for increasing disparities in compensation between working America and our nation’s most privileged.       • No mandate for handing Goldman Sachs executives the keys to our economy.       • No mandate for turning our foreign policy over to Exxon oil tycoons.       • No mandate to put an individual bent on increasing water and air pollution in charge of environmental   policies. It’s time for Trump to listen to the voices of all Americans—not just the minority of Americans that voted for him. And if he won’t, U.S. Senate Democrats and I will be leading the fight to hold him accountable and stay true to our “We the People” system of governance.","video","https://www.facebook.com/jeffmerkley/videos/10154182779881546/",NA,6320,857,4212,845,27,20,24,161

A commander to the end, Wes was determined to look out for his crews and all who served on contaminated planes.     After hearing about this issue, Senator Richard Burr and I launched a bipartisan effort to push the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide care and compensation for veterans who served in Agent Orange contaminated C-123s. After years of fighting, we were pleased to announce in 2015 that the VA finally agreed to provide these former reservists with the care that they earned.

I have heard from: • A 26-year old woman from Portland whose kidneys will fail and who will die without the help of the prescription medication she receives as part of her ACA coverage • A wife and daughter from Beaverton with chronic health conditions who will not be able to afford to pay for their medical costs if insurance companies can turn them away for their pre-existing conditions. • The mother of a young woman from Wilsonville with special needs, who will lose funding for her programs, her respite care and her Medicaid if the ACA is repealed • A man in Portland who was able to get the care he needed thanks to the ACA after suffering congestive heart failure and may not be able to access his life-sustaining medication and heart replacement if the ACA is repealed. Without the ACA, he expects that a life-saving heart transplant will mean bankruptcy.  • A woman from Terrebonne who was given the opportunity to live once again because of the availability and affordability of the ACA to cover her chronic illness • Oregon doctors who currently don't have to turn away patients for lack of coverage but worry that soon that will change.  The list goes on and on. For the sake of these Oregonians and over 20 million other Americans whose lives are on the line, we cannot let the GOP’s plans to #MakeAmericaSickAgain become a reality!

They are anxious because they see an incoming President who knocks Americans down instead of lifting them up. They are anxious because they fear they, or people they love, may be targeted simply for their faith, their gender, the color of their skin, or their ethnicity.   I hope President Trump changes direction and recognizes his solemn responsibility to respect and celebrate all Americans.  But if, as I fear, he does not, I will keep standing with all the Americans he has attacked. To women, people of color, the LGBTQ community, Muslims, immigrants and everyone who is worried about their place in America today: I will never stop fighting for the rights and values we hold dear as Americans.   As someone who has dedicated my life to fighting for working families, I will keep pushing to make America work for working Americans. I hope that the new President and new Administration will join this fight.   But here is a message for President Trump: Fighting for working Americans is not compatible with a Treasury Secretary who made his fortune foreclosing on working families. It is not compatible with an Education Secretary who seeks to strip resources from the public schools that she clearly does not understand. It is not compatible with a Labor Secretary who has spent his career innovating new ways to grind workers into the ground. It is not compatible with a Secretary of State who as a Big Oil executive sided with Iran against the American people.   A President committed to helping working families would not name a cabinet representing big banks, big oil and billionaires.

If President Trump were serious about healing the divisions in America and undoing the damage wrought by Senate Republicans last year, he could have named Merrick Garland to fill this seat.

That is why today I am joining Senator Tom Carper and my fellow Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee to boycott the committee’s consideration of Pruitt’s nomination until he answers these questions.  We want to know: what was Pruitt talking about with companies like Devon Energy while serving as Oklahoma Attorney General? When I asked him in the hearing why he copied and pasted Devon Energy’s words verbatim onto official letterhead for the State of Oklahoma, he evaded my questions. Throughout his testimony, Pruitt consistently repeated “such communications can be requested from the Oklahoma Office of the Attorney General,” though he knows his office of the Oklahoma Attorney General has a track record sitting on such information requests for years. What is Scott Pruitt trying to hide?  We also have significant questions about how he will deal with the many conflicts of interest that will come up. He has spent most of his time as Attorney General suing the agency he is now on the verge of leading. Will he permanently recuse himself from anything having to do with those lawsuits?  If he cannot answer the multitude of questions we’ve asked about his record and views, neither we nor the American people can have confidence that Pruitt is working to keep air and water clean, rather than protecting the profits of polluters.  Until Scott Pruitt answers these important questions; until he clarifies his positions and tells us how he is going to resolve the many conflicts of interest his nomination poses, it would be irresponsible for the committee to vote on his nomination. Committee Republicans should stand up to Trump and insist on the time to finish the job, but if they don't, Democrats on the committee won't be complicit.

Trump’s plan to roll back Wall Street reform is an unacceptable assault on working America. Following the financial crisis that cost American families their jobs, homes and savings, we passed the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law in 2010 to protect working Americans against Wall Street abuses. And it has proven to work for America. Thanks to these reforms, our economy is stronger and American consumers are safer from predatory financial practices.     We have come too far towards meaningful Wall Street reform to let former Goldman Sachs Executive Gary Cohn come in and pursue the unchecked recklessness that led us into the depths of the 2008 financial crisis and paralyzed our economy in the first place. We need a system that lays out clear rules of the road—a system that is not about quarterly profit margins or the size of bonuses on Wall Street, but is about providing a foundation for business to thrive, for employment to be increased, for families to find work, and to build financial foundations for the success of those families over the next several decades.   Nobody wants a repeat of the financial collapse of 2008. You can bet I’ll be fighting tooth and nail against any rollbacks of Wall Street reform to ensure our financial system can continue to be an engine for real prosperity.

These are just some of the many Multnomah County, Oregon residents whose lives are on the line with the GOP’s reckless plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and run without a replacement in sight. For these Oregonians, ACA repeal is not an option.   For the over 2 million Oregonians covered through employer-sponsored health plans, coverage has expanded under the ACA to include an end to annual lifetime limits, coverage until age 26, free preventive care, elimination of pre-existing condition clauses, coverage of contraceptives, and more. For low-income communities, communities of color, and immigrants and refugee communities in Multnomah County, the ACA has immensely mitigated health disparities that have plagued our system for too long. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act expanded Oregon Health Plan coverage to over 400,000 Oregonians. Today, nearly 95% of all Oregonians are insured. Thanks to the ACA, Oregon is now saving $170 million per year in uncompensated care costs.   We have come too far in reforming health care to let the GOP repeal and run plan take away coverage for 18 million Americans in just the first year alone, throw our insurance markets into chaos, jack up costs and premiums on American families, go after seniors’ Medicare and give insurance companies the final say over YOUR health care.

Before Donald J. Trump comes to Congress tomorrow night to urge us to help him destroy health care for the middle class, he should have to look Americans like Marlene in the eye. He should have to explain why he is okay taking away their lifesaving care.  https://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-to-highlight-crucial-benefits-of-affordable-care-act-with-guest-to-joint-session","link","https://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-to-highlight-crucial-benefits-of-affordable-care-act-with-guest-to-joint-session","merkley.senate.gov",940,85,110,150,2,13,4,0

He said he’s going to build a ‘great, great wall’ to stop illegal immigration, but didn’t say how he’s going to pay for it. He said he wants massive tax relief for the middle class but gave no details on the tax reform his team is working on. He said he wants to invest in our nation’s infrastructure, but offered no plan.  There’s no clearer example of Trump’s empty promises than his continuing calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and rip health care coverage away from 20 million low-income and working Americans without providing any real replacement plan. The truth is, rather than the ‘disaster’ that Trump claims it is, the Affordable Care Act is literally saving lives. That’s a fact. I know it, because I was honored to bring as my guest tonight a woman who owes her life, and the life of her son, to the Affordable Care Act.  Marlene Barbera and her son Max were both deathly ill and in need of liver transplants to survive. Because of the ACA, they were both able to get insurance coverage, both able to get the transplants they needed, and they are both alive today to share their stories. Without the ACA, the continuing post-transplant care they need will be put in jeopardy, and both of their lives will be put at risk.  The American people deserve answers. They deserve to know the details of Donald Trump’s plans and how he intends to pay for his programs. Above all, they deserve to know their access to quality, affordable health care is secure and that they have a fair and equal shot at prosperity.  https://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-statement-on-the-presidents-address-to-a-joint-session-of-congress-","photo","https://www.facebook.com/jeffmerkley/photos/a.10150150506066546.281482.74374931545/10154334576581546/?type=3",NA,1019,162,108,65,3,5,41,16

In addition, both the uninsured rate and the rate of health premium inflation have dropped substantially.  Under TrumpCare, small business owners who qualified for ACA tax credits would see an immediate jump in their costs as those credits vanished.

Republicans have already done great damage to the health care system, and need to fix the problems they’ve created.

But first, Republican leaders must fully absorb the message sent loud and clear by grassroots America and echoed in today’s failure: Stop playing games with our health care.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/jeffmerkley/photos/a.10150150506066546.281482.74374931545/10154403246441546/?type=3",NA,1108,180,163,96,9,2,0,3

Assad’s actions are a clear violation of international treaties and Syria’s own recent agreements, and all nations — including Russia, China and Iran — should condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms and work together to act in response.   It is essential, however, that before the U.S. undertakes any ongoing military campaign in Syria, the President consult with Congress and seek congressional authorization, in accordance with Article I of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution.

In addition, millions more would buy policies that they think provide coverage but in reality are worth little more than the paper they are printed on.   TrumpCare 2.0 breaks every single health care promise President Trump made:   He promised he’d cover everyone – this bill covers millions fewer people.   He promised coverage would be better – this bill makes coverage worse, with essential benefits made optional.   He promised health care would cost less – yet for older Americans on modest incomes, the price of health care skyrockets under this bill.   He promised he wouldn’t cut Medicaid – this bill cuts Medicaid by more than $800 billion.   He promised he would sustain full protection for people with preexisting conditions – this bill destroys this guarantee.   TrumpCare 2.0’s trail of broken promises is a path to destroying health care in America and destroying peace of mind for millions of American families.

Reopening offshore drilling in the Arctic would be the height of irresponsibility. In the Arctic’s remote and dangerous conditions, responding effectively to a drilling accident or oil spill is extremely difficult, if not downright impossible.   There is no reason to put lives and entire ecosystems at risk just to extract oil that will intensify climate disruption.   Further, this decision threatens the way of life for countless communities along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, including those in Oregon. These communities spoke loud and clear during the development of the initial plan: They don’t want offshore drilling that will diminish tourism, harm commercial fishing operations, and burden them with the risk of a potential oil spill.   With climate disruption continuing to accelerate, it's time for the Trump Administration to stop listening to special interests, and start listening to the millions of Americans who are calling on us to act on climate and keep fossil fuels in the ground.  http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/340505-interior-begins-public-review-of-offshore-drilling-plan","link","http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/340505-interior-begins-public-review-of-offshore-drilling-plan","thehill.com",236,118,183,7,2,11,121,513

This landmark law included my provision, known as the Volcker Rule, that prohibits banks from making precisely the risky trades that got us into such a devastating financial mess in 2008. The Volcker Rule serves as a firewall to keep banks from gambling with Americans’ deposits, and keep them focusing on good old-fashioned banking: providing credit to businesses and families. And for the past seven years, these and the other reforms have been keeping our families' and small businesses' banks safe and secure.   However, President Trump and Congressional Republicans are now trying to repeal Dodd-Frank and reopen the Wall Street casino that dragged our country into the Great Recession in the first place. American families cannot afford for us to turn back the clock now. The American people are counting on Congress to work on their behalf. I’ll do everything in my power to protect Main Street from Wall Street abuses and fight for a strong, fair, and stable financial system for all.  https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-07-18/house-republicans-take-on-dodd-frank-tax-reform-in-new-budget","link","https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-07-18/house-republicans-take-on-dodd-frank-tax-reform-in-new-budget","usnews.com",302,105,113,15,2,38,21,287

The president’s pronouncement that he plans to avoid disclosing troop levels, military strategies and timelines — combined with his criticism of so called ‘micromanagement from Washington, D.C.’ — are clear indications of his intention to bolster military action in Afghanistan. But far too much of our blood and treasure has been spilled in Afghanistan, and it is long past time that we work toward strategies to wind down our operations.  The United States must stay engaged directly and with regional partners to fight terrorism in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but additional U.S. troops on the ground — without details on their missions or how we will measure their success — is not a long-term approach in America’s best interest.   It is both notable and troubling that the president’s statement included no discussion about how he proposes to address the persistent deficiencies that have hampered the success of the mission for a decade and a half. For years, the American game plan has been to buy the Afghans a little more time, yet rampant corruption, weaknesses of the central government, and ethnic tensions continue to fuel the insurgency. The American people are understandably weary of continuing to send our men and women into harm’s way when the Afghan government isn’t taking the steps necessary for success.   It is imperative that President Trump consult with Congress before moving forward with any major new actions in Afghanistan. It is critical that Americans and their representatives in Congress weigh in on any additional plans. Secrecy on the most fundamental issues of mission and troop levels is designed to avoid accountability, and has no place in our ‘We the People’ republic.  Americans are exhausted by a seemingly endless war. We have lost too many brave service members, and we owe all who have served there an extraordinary debt of gratitude. It is time for the president to present a compelling plan for regional stability and an end to American military involvement — not a vague plan to continue the failed strategies of the past.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-expected-to-announce-small-troop-increase-in-afghanistan-in-prime-time-address/2017/08/21/eb3a513e-868a-11e7-a94f-3139abce39f5_story.html?utm_term=.abbb697be759","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-expected-to-announce-small-troop-increase-in-afghanistan-in-prime-time-address/2017/08/21/eb3a513e-868a-11e7-a94f-3139abce39f5_story.html?utm_term=.abbb697be759","washingtonpost.com",418,302,104,17,1,6,92,239

Ever.  Today, Trump may be trying to muddy the waters by claiming it’s no longer a Muslim Ban—but the discriminatory heart of this proposal is still alive and well.  Don't be fooled by Trump's weak attempts to bury criticism that his ban is discriminatory and unjust. While he may have changed the fine print, make no mistake: This ban is still a smokescreen for the same kind of discrimination we saw in the original Muslim Ban. Just like the old ban, the new ban threatens our core values as a nation of immigrants, doesn’t make us any safer, and will tear families apart.  It means that families who may have been waiting years to be reunited will have to continue living apart with no hope for future reunification. Other community members who simply want a relative to visit for a special occasion such as a wedding, graduation, or the birth of a child will no longer be able to share those special moments. These are our friends and our neighbors. An attack on them is an attack on us all.

Consumers and entrepreneurs alike need a free, open and competitive Internet. What has made the Internet the most powerful tool of the 21st century is that it’s a level playing field, where an interesting idea or an innovative startup can reach millions of people no matter whom it came from.  Now, the FCC Chair wants to allow the Internet to become a place where big telecom companies can act as gatekeepers or toll collectors, and only the wealthy and powerful can play. This is a disaster. Preventing “throttling” and paid “fast lanes” was a huge step forward for consumers and for American innovation, and reversing those rules is yet another way the Trump administration is prioritizing the privileged and powerful over small businesses and consumers.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html","nytimes.com",417,180,443,5,6,27,56,714
