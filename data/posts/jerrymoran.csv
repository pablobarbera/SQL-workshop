I was not particularly excited about the outcome of that election, but I happened to be in Washington for work and thought it could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a few colleagues and me. The enduring memory I have of that day was the overall atmosphere of unity and goodwill that prevailed. Though not as contentious as the election that we have just gone through, this was a tough one, too. Nonetheless, as we walked through the crowds on that January day, there was a genuine sense that all was well. When the president, whom I had not supported, spoke there were cheers all across the National Mall. But more importantly, as my colleagues and I were sitting on a bench eating sub sandwiches following the swearing in, the Marine helicopter carrying the now former President and Barbara Bush departed the Capitol one last time at tree level, low enough that you could see them in the windows. And as they passed the public all stood and waved as they waved back with smiles on their faces. I will always remember that moment in which I was truly proud to be an American and part of a system that could transfer power so peacefully and gracefully.

With a new congress and administration, we have a real opportunity to make changes in our federal government that will improve the everyday lives of Kansans and Americans. It was good to hear the president‚Äôs commitment to establishing an environment for businesses to thrive and hire more Americans. I want Americans to have better jobs and more take home pay.  As I have expressed to the administration, there are a number of priorities that are too important to Kansans to compromise on. For example, we will not rest until Kansas veterans indicate that they are experiencing the kind of lasting change that‚Äôs needed at the VA and that they are receiving the benefits and respect they deserve. I will continue pushing for increased access to export markets for our state‚Äôs farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.

We discussed the impact the hospital's potential closure could have on area residents, and how I might be of assistance to the community during this challenging time. St. Francis sees more than 9,000 annual admissions, over 35,000 emergency room visits, maintains 378 licensed beds, and employs about 1,600 people. The hospital plays a central role in providing for the health needs of the community, and has a considerable impact on the local economy. During this time of uncertainty, I am committed to assisting the community served by St. Francis Hospital in any way I can.  On Saturday morning at an official Kansas State Department of Education meeting, board members and I discussed federal education issues. During my visit I heard a presentation from Kansas Commissioner of Education Dr. Randy Watson on the Board's ""moonshot"" plan for the future of education in Kansas called Kansans CAN. We discussed how certain federal education programs tie into the Board's vision for education in Kansas, as well as the importance of special education support, career and technical education programs, and impact aid.

I am pleased the President signed this bipartisan legislation to ensure the VA supports hardworking employees who care deeply about our veterans, and removes those few bad actors who fail to perform their duties in service to veterans.  Many Kansans are familiar with the disturbing case at the Leavenworth VA where an employee who stands accused of abusing the veterans he was supposed to serve while on the job was allowed to collect benefits after retiring from the VA. This must never be allowed to happen again, which is why I included in this bill a provision to make certain that senior VA executives and health care employees convicted of a felony related to their position at the VA cannot receive the same benefits as those who honorably serve. This law is a step forward for our veterans and one of many changes the VA must make if they are going to earn back the trust of veterans and provide them with the care they have earned and deserve.","link","https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=EFB7259D-2FE6-47EC-B2D3-4C1911CD3E91","moran.senate.gov",206,69,16,13,0,4,0,0

A good start is ensuring the tax code treats tribal governments equally with state and local governments.   We discussed legislation that I recently introduced, S. 1935, the Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act, which seeks to offer tribal governments the same means to promote prosperity that other levels of government currently enjoy.

An Open Letter to U.S. Farmer and Rancher Organizations:  While tax reform dominates the discussion in Washington, D.C., U.S. agriculture must not allow its focus to be diverted from the equally important issue of agricultural trade. Reforming our nation‚Äôs tax code is critical to growing the economy and can benefit all Americans. However, there will be little to no benefit of tax reform to farmers and ranchers if their ability to sell what they produce around the world is diminished‚Ä¶  The ability of a new generation of young producers to make a living in agriculture is impacted far more by the wheat, corn, cotton, and beef being exported each year than by any single tax deduction. And tax rates are irrelevant to the farmer or rancher who loses half of their income due to lost export markets‚Ä¶  With the leadership of agricultural organizations, we can help rally farmers and ranchers to speak up about the importance of trade to the future of a livelihood in agriculture.

The students described their daily schedule and what their school offers, then showed me around the athletic facilities along with the theater, choir and band rooms. We visited the ROTC program, which has the distinct honor of being the oldest in the nation ‚Äì first established in 1916. I also viewed Auto One class, which is held in partnership with Highland Community college, to see what the students were up to. Auto One students work on cars, learning mechanical skills and design.

Following my visit to LHS, the Salvation Army of Leavenworth County shared the Leavenworth Kiwanis Club program with me during their meeting at the Heritage Center. One of the many things I am thankful for is the good work of service organizations like the Kiwanis Club who provide for so many not only during the holiday season but year-round, getting Kansans young and old involved in serving one another.
