Unfortunately, the Obama Administration ends on January 20.  That is why we asked President Obama to take action that would protect DACA recipients and prevent the new administration from using the recipients’ personal information for purposes not originally intended, such as deportation.  Given the statements of the incoming Trump Administration, DACA enrollees are currently living in fear of an uncertain future.  They fear being ripped from their home, their family, and the only country they know.

This is a heartbreaking day for our country, and for the bright young DACA recipients who know no home but America.  Our country needs these young people and their talents more than ever to strengthen our economy and our society.  President Trump’s decision to end DACA is cruel, destructive, and un-American.  The United States is a nation built in large part by the contributions, innovations, and inventions of immigrants. The president’s action against DACA only weakens the United States.  I will continue fighting in Congress to pass legislation that will permanently protect DACA recipients before the six months expire.  That is why I have joined Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in introducing the DREAM Act of 2017, a bipartisan bill allowing U.S.-raised immigrant youth to earn lawful permanent residence and American citizenship.  And it is why I have helped introduce the American Hope Act of 2017, which creates a path to permanent legal status and eventual citizenship for DACA recipients and all qualifying DREAMers brought to the US as children.  I call on my fellow congressmembers to join me in supporting these bills, so that we may help these American youth continue to strengthen our country.  #DefendDACA #DACA #DREAMers #DREAMAct","status",NA,NA,88,17,15,16,2,0,16,5

For example, there are 57,310 families in Congressman Paul Cook's district alone who claim this deduction, for an average of $8,845 apiece. Yet Rep. Cook voted for a GOP budget that made it possible to get rid of this deduction.  Instead of double-taxing middle class families in his own district, Rep.

This bill cuts $6.35 billion over eight years from the Prevention and Public Health Fund. These cuts will decimate community programs that help keep people healthy and avoid expensive medical treatments. The bill also penalizes those who miss a private health insurance premium payment by shortening the current grace period of 90 days to 30 days.  This shortened time will lead to as many as 688,000 low and moderate income Americans losing their state Marketplace health insurance coverage. In addition, while the bill provides some relief for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as they struggle to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, the bill is inadequate to help these hurricane victims. I strongly support the reauthorization of CHIP and CHCs, but not if it means including the bill’s deeply damaging provisions, which will cause great harm to working families.","status",NA,NA,8,2,1,0,0,0,1,0

So does the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Migration and Refugee Services.  And so do I.  DHS’s differing responses towards Nicaraguan and Honduran TPS recipients in the US are a stark illustration of why we need comprehensive immigration reform to resolve the numerous #immigration issues facing our nation.

This rushed piece of legislation will not only add more than $1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, but it will also shift the burden of paying for that debt to our hardworking families.  Despite our Republican colleagues' assertions that this tax plan will benefit the majority of Americans, numerous economists disagree.  They note that nearly 45% of all households with children will see a tax increase, while 80% of our wealthiest citizens will receive a tax cut by 2027.  Even more egregious, this tax bill seeks to eliminate the long-standing state and local tax deduction, subjecting every wage earner's income to double taxation.  This defeats the original framers' intent to avoid a system of double taxation.  The original tax code, drafted in 1913, consisted of three pages in its entirety and included the state and local tax deduction at the core of its responsible tax policy to ensure state and local governments could raise revenues for public schools, police, fire, and emergency services.  Plain and simple, this tax plan is a tremendous windfall for our wealthiest 1% and large corporations.  It favors large businesses over small businesses, it favors sending jobs overseas rather than creating jobs at home, it favors the wealthy over hourly wage earners, and it pays for these tax cuts for the wealthy by raising taxes on our middle class families to the detriment of Medicare, Medicaid, education, and other vital public services.  The fact is, this bill is so skewed to benefit the wealthiest 1% in America that it could more accurately be named ""H.R. 1%.""  In the name of the other 99% of Americans, I voted against H.R. 1.","link","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-gop-tax-plan-20171116-story.html","latimes.com",12,7,4,0,2,1,6,8

Today’s vote also makes it painfully clear that Republicans are not yet able to put forward a long-term plan to fund the government.  Despite controlling the House, Senate, and White House, they waited until just one day before government funding expired to vote on a stopgap bill to keep the government open for two weeks.  In fact, the GOP is so deeply divided that since they took the House majority in 2011, they have never passed a major funding bill without Democratic votes.    Today’s vote only delays important choices about our nation’s future.  It is time for the majority to work with Democrats to develop a responsible and bipartisan agreement.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-set-to-delay-shutdown-setting-up-bigger-spending-fight-later/2017/12/07/6b6712fa-db51-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html","washingtonpost.com",22,9,2,1,0,1,0,0

Their vote jeopardizes Americans’ free speech and our nation’s thriving internet economy.  Without net neutrality, ISPs – internet service providers – will be able to restrict the online content my constituents can access, degrade their internet viewing experience, and raise the cost of accessing certain websites and online services.  ISPs will also get to charge websites and application makers higher prices to join ‘fast lanes’ for online traffic.  Ending net neutrality will be a boon to the wealthy who can afford faster speeds and greater access.  But working people will be burdened with a slower internet.  Entrepreneurs and innovators who can’t afford to compete on a pay-to-play internet will be unable to spread their great ideas and create jobs out of those ideas.  Activists will lose their access to a neutral internet, and with it, a powerful advocacy tool.  Today’s #FCC vote makes it all the more important to fight for strong net neutrality rules that protect consumers and keep the internet strong – and that is exactly what I plan to do.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/14/the-fcc-is-expected-to-repeal-its-net-neutrality-rules-today-in-a-sweeping-act-of-deregulation/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_net-nutrality-715am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.16ce8c09e0b6","washingtonpost.com",25,9,12,0,0,0,5,24
