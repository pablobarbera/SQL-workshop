I agree, especially when it comes at the expense of our job creators. The ever growing cost of compliance is hurting small businesses and manufacturers as over-burdensome regulations unnecessarily constrain job creators, often limiting growth opportunities. We should be doing everything in our power to relieve this tension.   That is why I am pleased the House passed H.R. 26, the REINS Act, last night. This measure would enhance oversight over the current burdensome regulatory process by requiring an up-or-down vote from Congress on any major rule by a Federal agency, before it can be enforced. As a cosponsor of the REINS Act, I was proud to vote for a bill that will curb executive overreach, cut down on unneeded government bureaucracy, and hold government agencies accountable for the regulations they impose on Americans.","link","http://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1094","ittman.house.gov",101,41,11,4,1,1,1,4

Under current law, active duty service members are able to maintain one state of legal residency for tax purposes even when they move on military orders. Spouses may be granted the same benefit, but only if both service member and spouse have the same tax residence at the time of their marriage. This causes complications when service members move, sometimes multiple times a year, because spouses are forced to establish residency in each new location.   The Military Residency Choice Act will allow military spouses, if they so choose, to establish the same state of residency as the service member, so that for any future moves, they will retain the same state for tax and voting purposes.

During the pause in refugee resettlement our national security agencies will conduct a review of the vetting process to ensure that anyone entering the United States does not pose a national security risk.

The legislation would grant federal recognition to the Chickahominy, the Eastern Chickahominy, the Upper Mattaponi, the Rappahannock, the Monacan, and the Nansemond tribes. These tribes have received official recognition from the Commonwealth of Virginia but have faced barriers preventing them from receiving federal recognition because of gaps in official records.

Since 1976, every February we celebrate Black History Month as a tribute to the achievements of American Americans in U.S. history.   From our country’s beginning, African Americans have shown immeasurable courage. From fighting side by side with Patriots on our path to independence to marching down the National Mall for the rights they deserved, African Americans have been building and shaping our country: Abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass fighting for the rights of slaves; Langston Hughes using his words to illustrate black life in America from the 20s to the 60s; Dr. King and Rosa Parks leading the movement against segregation; Rep. Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm as the first African American woman elected to Congress; Rep. Bobby Scott as the first African American to represent Virginia since Reconstruction; and Barack Obama as our first African American President.   Many of these achievements, in their time, were unsung. However by highlighting these stories we are able to reveal the vital role African Americans played in shaping our society as we know it. We cannot change the past, we can only change the future. This month, I am excited to celebrate and honor all of these past achievements, but also our future.

Finally, we must continue to focus on increasing economic growth and spurring job creation.

A CR keeps last year’s funding the same until a budget can eventually be passed. In addition to stagnant funding, a CR does not allow for new starts of programs, maintenance contracts, end strength increases, or even the money to simply transfer military members and their families from duty station to duty station. The armed services simply cannot budget. We would never expect a corporation, small business, or even a household to operate like this, yet we have continued to ask our military to do this year after year. CRs have sent the signal to our military to continue to do more with less and to operate in uncertainty.  http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/rob-wittman-column-congressional-irresponsibility-is-wrecking-the-military-that/article_b03615f6-2f87-5b4a-a954-2b27c5ae7e82.html","link","http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/rob-wittman-column-congressional-irresponsibility-is-wrecking-the-military-that/article_b03615f6-2f87-5b4a-a954-2b27c5ae7e82.html","richmond.com",66,29,5,2,1,1,3,2

Today, we celebrate 242 years of the United States Navy!  The U.S. Navy was established on this day, October 13th, 1775, by the Continental Congress to target British commerce vessels in the Revolutionary War. The Founding Fathers hoped that this force would work with privateers to enact tactical raids against the British, impacting their supplies and mitigating their forces. Thus, the early Navy was mostly comprised of smaller ships. After the war, the Navy was dismantled but hastily reassembled in 1794 following the impending threat of pirate attacks, and remained intact thereafter. The Navy lived up to their reestablishment by combating piracy in the Mediterranean and the British once again in the War of 1812.   The U.S. Navy underwent further transformation as America faced her own Civil War. Accompanying a bloody war was rapidly advancing technology; torpedoes and steamships emerged as mainstays of naval warfare. At the turn of the century, the U.S. Navy once again realized the need to grow stronger following the sinking of the USS Maine.  Much of the modern picture of the U.S. Navy is formed by the events and innovations of the 20th century. While the U.S. became active in both world wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and other causes around the world, technology such as submarines, RADAR, and aviation became staples of our Navy. The role of the Navy changed from purely seapower to assisting other types of U.S. operations through strategy and intelligence, humanitarian missions, and ensuring that America continues to be an effective force for good in the world.   As Chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I am honored to see firsthand the impact the brave men and women in the U.S. Navy make in our communities and the role they have in keeping our great nation safe. My duty and my goal is to ensure our Navy sailors have the tools, training, and equipment they need to complete their mission. The Navy has been, and will continue to be, the tip of the spear in our national defense strategy.  Happy Birthday to the U.S. Navy!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRobWittman/photos/a.10150237963007634.325951.38932542633/10155094353837634/?type=3",NA,93,12,19,15,2,0,0,0

Our Veterans of every war--of every generation--have earned the title: American hero. Their service and their sacrifice, both at home and abroad, have defined our past, present, and future here in the United States. Next weekend our nation will honor those who have selflessly served. This November 11th, we will celebrate the patriots who have played a role in the continued preservation of our great republic.  Virginia’s First District is rich with military history, and is home to one of the largest veteran populations in the country. I hope you take the time this Veterans Day to talk with a veteran and learn more about their service. Whether it is Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, or Coast Guardsmen their support for this nation is steadfast, their determination to see a mission through is unwavering, and their integrity and selflessness are undying. America is who she is today because of them.  In commemoration of Veterans Day this year, I want to share some of the stories of the First District’s Veterans. If you’d like to participate please send of picture along of you or a loved one in uniform. Please include a caption or anecdote, service branch or rank, for my office to share on Veterans Day.
