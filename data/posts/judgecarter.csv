I am proud to sponsor this important legislation, and will keep working to make it law!  The Veterans Transplant Coverage Act removes unnecessary barriers that prevent our heroes from receiving the care they deserve. Right now under current law, a veteran in critical need of an organ transplant can't receive a donation from a non-veteran. This even excludes children, siblings, and other non-veteran family members - the people a veteran would most likely find a successful organ match with.  This is unacceptable. My bill will allow veterans to recieve live donations from non-veterans, and allow them to have the procedure done at their own local hospital.

Today the Nelson family and I joined together to bring their story to Congress.   When Charles Nelson, a 100% disabled veteran, needed a kidney transplant, his son was a match - but the VA system denied him coverage. Instead the Nelson’s were forced to solicit donations to pay for the surgery and save Charles’ life. After hearing that the Nelson’s had to fundraise and drain their savings because of the VA’s policy, I knew that I had to bring this fight to Washington.   Unfortunately, the Nelson’s story is one of far too many.
