Six years with the gavel. It goes by pretty fast. But a brief glimpse in the rear view mirror reveals that we left nothing on the table. Our 562 hearings produced a lot. And historically, we excelled. And even with all six years occurring with a divided government, we got the job done.   Multi-year, multi-Congress efforts paid off in the form of landmark chemical safety updates and mental health reforms. Public health was a beacon of much of our success, with dozens of laws now on the books to help all Americans, including the capstone legislation to deliver #CuresNow.   Because of the work and dedication of all of our members, we defied the wisdom that Washington was broken and passed 354 bills and provisions through the House with 202 bills and provisions being signed into law. Pretty impressive for a Congress that's not supposed to function. We had big ideas. And through hard work and determination, we had big results.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepFredUpton/photos/a.252749638088905.66817.212027388827797/1363714616992396/?type=3",NA,41,15,5,3,0,2,0,0

One out of three counties across the country have only one insurance provider and it looks like it will only get worse as others are on the verge of pulling the plug. Nearly two dozen of the non-profit co-ops have gone belly up. Here in Michigan folks saw their premiums increased by nearly 17 percent. Some forecast a 40-to-50 percent rate increase if nothing happens.  High premiums, lack of access, rising costs. These donâ€™t just impact Republicans or Democrats. They impact us all. The status quo is simply unacceptable.  Our legislation is a first step in the right direction to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare. We expand and enhance Health Savings Accounts. We provide a reasonable transition until 2020 for those on the Medicaid expansion and then grandfather all those folks until theyâ€™re off. We help young adults stay on their parents insurance until theyâ€™re 26. We provide a monthly tax credit for low and middle-income individuals and families who donâ€™t receive insurance through work or government program.  We also protect those with pre-existing conditions. I told the president directly this week that I would not support this bill as written without a fix. He took the challenge and we walked him through the problems and potential solutions. Covering those with pre-existing conditions is of the utmost importance to me. Our bill already ensures that insurance companies are prohibited from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Our amendment further protects people from the financial impact associated with having a pre-existing condition.  I also voted in favor of H.R. 2192, which makes a simple technical correction to H.R. 1628 to ensure that the AHCA and its amendments apply equally to everyone. If the AHCA becomes law, members of Congress and congressional staff will be treated the same as any other citizen as it should be.   No, this process has not been perfect. I have heard from many on both sides of this debate. I pledge to continue listening and will be a constructive partner in making our healthcare system work better for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,626,3491,305,44,7,5,152,2237

Since that day we have come together in a healing process and seen an outpouring of support for Sheriff Paul Bailey, his department, and all of our local law enforcement and first responders.  Today is a solemn reminder of what we went through and we mark it by remembering Joseph Zangaro, whom I knew personally. He was a widely respected and well-liked former Michigan State Police Trooper and head of courthouse security. We also remember Ronald Kienzle, a U.S. Army veteran and retired Benton Township Police Officer who loved his motorcycle and his family.  What happened right here in our community is a daily reminder of the sacrifices our law enforcement officers, and their families, make every single day in order to keep the rest of us safe and secure. This heartbreaking tragedy happened in the blink of an eye, but we will never forget.  Thanks to ABC 57 for telling this story.

This common-sense framework will deliver tax relief for middle-class families, allow workers to take home more money, and put American businesses in a better competitive position â€“ keeping jobs here at home.  Americans need tax relief and reform now more than ever. As Iâ€™ve spoken to countless folks and businesses, small and large, here in Southwest Michigan all agree that our tax code is too unwieldy, too costly, and too complicated. Itâ€™s time to change that so we can unleash American competitiveness and ingenuity which will create more good-paying jobs and economic benefits right here.  Iâ€™m confident we can deliver this year.

This silent epidemic has torn through families, neighborhoods, and communities both in my home state of Michigan and indeed across the entire country. In 2015, there were nearly 2,000 opioid abuse related deaths in Michigan alone. Even more tragically, more than 22,000 babies are born every year across the country with Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome.  It has hit home both in my community and yes, even my own family. This is personal to me.  In the last few years I have been meeting with first responders, crisis center employees, advocacy groups, and yes â€“ individuals suffering. All of these folks have said that, tragically, the death toll continues to rise.  This is why we have been taking concrete action here in the Energy and Commerce Committee to combat this widespread epidemic. Just last year, the president signed into law a sweeping package aimed at attacking the opioid epidemic from all sides.  As part of my landmark, bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, an additional 1 billion dollars was allocated to states, like Michigan, to address opioid addiction treatment and prevention. Just this year, the first round of that funding was delivered.  Michigan received more than 16 million dollars. This grant funding will make a real difference. To those suffering, I just say this: Help is on the way.  There is more work to be done. Clearly. And here in Congress we will continue to take steps to address this epidemic. In this committee, weâ€™re on the front lines in advancing meaningful, bipartisan legislation that will make a difference. Together, we can take this â€œsilent epidemicâ€ and bring it out of the shadows.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepFredUpton/videos/1665137553516766/",NA,33,29,4,0,0,0,0,0

Hereâ€™s what our plan does for individuals:  -significantly increases the standard deduction -expands the Child Tax Credit -preserves the Adoption Tax Credit -preserves the mortgage interest deduction -expands the medical expense deduction -continues the charitable contribution deduction, and more.   We lower the corporate tax rate to 21 percent â€“ down from the highest rate in the industrialized world and eliminate incentives to move Michigan jobs overseas. We also deliver significant tax relief to Southwest Michigan small businesses.   At the end of the day this will be a big win for Michigan middle class families and our economy. After 31 years, itâ€™s time to get this done.
