Refugees from a particularly troubled region of the world ‚Äì the Middle East ‚Äì pose a significant threat. Many of these countries are failed states where radical Islamic terrorism has proliferated. The FBI and DHS have all said they cannot properly vet refugees from these regions because there is simply no central government that can reliably assist America in conducting proper background checks. This is why we must pass my bill H.R. 80, the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act, which reasserts Congressional authority over the refugee program by imposing a moratorium on all refugees until the Congress gives specific approval to new vetting measures. My bill also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to provide Congress with a report describing refugee dependence on social welfare programs. Americans have always opened their arms to persecuted peoples and we will continue to do so.

Dodd-Frank allows the largest hand full of banks to have a competitive advantage over smaller community banks and credit unions. This bureaucratic nightmare imposes a confusing and costly burden for Americans seeking a home mortgage and small businesses who want to expand and create new jobs. This week, the House passed the CHOICE Act to replace Dodd-Frank with policies that will provide Americans with more financial choices and freedom while growing jobs and a healthy economy. The CHOICE Act strengthens financial accountability, imposes tougher penalties for financial fraud, ends taxpayer bailouts of the big banks and ensures that consumers have more choices.

Across our congressional district, we saw anywhere between 20 and 50 inches of rain, setting a new record. In fact, unofficially, ranchers in Liberty County measured over 60 inches of rain. The impact was devastating and widespread. But in the midst of this devastation, there were, and still continue to be, incredible stories of goodness.   In Orange, a young couple canceled their wedding to help their friends and neighbors clean up and begin the process of rebuilding. In Cleveland, a constable organized a flotilla of boats to deliver shelter and supplies. In Deer Park, church members sprang into action immediately and began cooking and sharing meals with evacuees from Houston. In Silsbee, a church opened a community shelter after the county's only other shelter was cut off by floodwaters. In Rose City, a neighbor rescued nearly everyone in his entire neighborhood on his airboat, even as his own home was flooded.   This has happened all across the Texas Gulf Coast, and the stories go on and on: neighbors helping neighbors, communities helping communities, strangers helping strangers. But that is what we do in East Texas. When times get tough, we pull together and we get to work. No one waits around to be told what to do. We are people of action, and we act when we see a need. And, quite frankly, this is what makes East Texas so special. Our communities are strong. And through our faith in God, we take care of one another in times of need regardless of our own means. It is our shared value for our fellow man that makes the difference.  In that same East Texas spirit, our office has been doing everything possible that we can do to help. From the very start, we have been working overtime to help people get back on their feet. We are blessed with a professional and dedicated staff that is second to none. And despite some of our own staff being flooded themselves, we have worked tirelessly to help our East Texas neighbors and friends get the information and resources they need to recover and build. This will be a long road to our recovery, but together, we will recover, and we will rebuild and come back stronger than ever.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBrianBabin/videos/754560111382641/",NA,192,21,79,22,0,0,0,2

The impact was devastating and widespread, but in the midst of this devastation, we have seen incredible stories of bravery, compassion and resiliency. One man, with his own home flooding, took his boat and rescued everyone in his entire community. The people there call him the savior of Rose City.  In that same Texas spirit, our office has been working tirelessly to help people get back on their feet. We have been spreading staff out across our nine counties, setting up mobile offices to provide constituents with one-on-one assistance in applying for help and ensuring they have access to a computer.  But many are still in very much need of assistance. This was made clear when over 800 residents recently showed up for our disaster recovery town hall meetings to get their questions answered directly from FEMA, SBA, USDA and other state and federal agencies.  Here are three things that everyone needs to know:  1. The deadline to apply for FEMA assistance is October 24, 2017. Visit www.disasterassistance.gov to file a claim. This is the first step in receiving assistance.  2. If you're initially denied by FEMA, be sure to file an appeal. Many people do get an initial denial from FEMA for a variety of reasons. We highly recommend that you appeal the denial.  3. You do not have to wait for an inspector to remove debris. But be absolutely sure to document all damage extensively for future reference.  If you run into any problems, please do not hesitate to contact our office. We are ready and eager to help. It is an honor to serve the good people of Southeast Texas. Together, we will recover and rebuild and come back stronger.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBrianBabin/photos/a.356109931227663.1073741828.355799157925407/759858124186173/?type=3",NA,41,9,9,4,0,0,0,0

That is what drove me to fight so hard for America while wearing a Trident.  At the same time, I did not really consider myself to be a SEAL, but a soldier for the Lord.‚Äù  In everything he did and throughout his life, he served the Lord from a place of deep faith.

I will continue advocating for my legislation (H.R. 3282: The ELD Extension Act of 2017) and other avenues to provide relief, but it is only prudent at this time for truck drivers and others affected by the mandate to assume that it will be in place for the foreseeable future.  I also want pass along my serious concerns about some particularly troubling aspects of this costly mandate.  As previously announced, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) has said their member associations in law enforcement will not be placing vehicles that lack an ELD out of service, or assessing demerit points until April 1st of next year.  However, they are now empowered to issue tickets and citations for non-compliance, including fines of $500 or more that begin starting today at the discretion of the local law enforcement jurisdiction.    In plain English, not having an ELD means you can still get a very expensive ticket starting today, but the points on your license or actions to take you off the road don‚Äôt start until April 1st.  I would also encourage those buying an ELD to use maximum caution and awareness when choosing from among the several hundred ‚Äúself-certified‚Äù options available.  We have already received reports of certain ELD‚Äôs that void the warranty of the engine it is plugged into, electrical and mechanical malfunctions, and other problems with very little recourse for those affected.  It has been my honor to lead this fight on your behalf, and it will continue to be so as we move on to the next phase.
