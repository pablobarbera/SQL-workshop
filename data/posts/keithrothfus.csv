They scar the landscapes, leak toxins into streams, and spontaneously combust, emitting all types of pollutants without any controls.   Through technological innovation, the private sector eventually developed a method using coal in these piles to create electricity, and this has allowed the cleanup of over 200 million tons of this waste coal from the Pennsylvania countryside.   In Western PA, we have several plants that are responsible for this tremendous work, but impending regulations from Washington are trying to cut off this progress, destroying hundreds of middle class jobs.   Bottom-line: My legislation, the SENSE Act,  will save good-paying jobs in the coal refuse-to-energy industry that creates affordable energy for consumers, remediates coal refuse piles into cheap, reliable energy, and restores Pennsylvania hillsides and streams to their original, natural state.","link","http://www.tribdem.com/news/lawmaker-s-sense-bill-heads-to-house/article_ef174882-e087-11e7-8689-831937d64028.html","tribdem.com",38,23,4,1,5,0,0,7
