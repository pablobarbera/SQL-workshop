Since my time in the Wisconsin State Legislature, I‚Äôve refused to take political donations from the pharmaceutical industry because of my belief that Big Pharma no longer prioritizes the creation of life-saving drugs over making money.

Mainly, the Dept. of Ed. created a  list of factors that would disqualify an employer from being referred individuals with disabilities from state vocational rehabilitation services to fill a job.  What's resulted is a direct assault on the AbilityOne Program, which is the largest source of employment opportunities for people who are blind or have significant disabilities in the United States. Many of these positions and jobs are referred to 18-25-year-olds. As the AbilityOne Program is cut off, we see these young people left behind and let slip through the cracks.  After the hearing, I had the opportunity to meet Yael Kerzan of Pardeeville and her parents. Yael was born with Williams Syndrome, but that doesn‚Äôt stop her from working not one ‚Äì but two jobs at Walmart and Northwoods Incorporated of Wisconsin. Yael now advocates for others who can benefit from WIOA, specifically those young adults between 18 and 25.
