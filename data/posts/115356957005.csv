When police act with empathy for the people they serve, both the police and the community reap the benefits.""  Read the full article below.","link","http://bit.ly/2kWe1ll","bit.ly",7,1,3,0,0,0,0,0

Public Law 112-141, div. F, title II, §100216, July 6, 2012, 126 Stat. 927; Pub. L. 113-89, §§27, 30, Mar. 21, 2014, 128 Stat. 1033, 1034; 42 U.S.C. §4101b (d) (1)(G)(i) and (H) (2014). Under Biggert-Waters: • The Administrator shall not less than 30 days before issuance of any preliminary map, notify the Senators for each State affected and each Member of the House of Representatives for each congressional district affected by the preliminary map in writing of the estimated schedule for: Community meetings regarding the preliminary map o Publication of notices regarding the preliminary map in local newspapers o The commencement of the appeals process regarding the map See Biggert-Waters, as amended, at 42 U.S.C. §4101b (d)(1)(G)(i).1 Biggert-Waters also states: • The Administrator shall upon the issuance of any proposed map and any notice of an opportunity to make an appeal relating to the proposed map, notify the Senators for each State affected and each Member of the House of Representatives for each congressional district affected by the proposed map of any action taken by the Administrator with respect to the proposed map or an appeal relating to the proposed map. See Biggert-Waters, as amended, at 42 U.S.C. §4101b (d)(1)(H).  Flooding has been, and continues to be, a serious risk in the United States—so serious that most insurance companies have specifically excluded flood damage from homeowners insurance. To address the need, the U.S. Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as a Federal program in 1968. The NFIP enabled property owners in participating communities to purchase flood insurance if the community adopted floodplain management ordinances and minimum standards for new construction. However, the owners of existing homes and businesses did not have to rebuild to the higher standards, and many received subsidized rates that did not reflect their true risk.  RISK MAP PROGRAM Flood risks change over time, based on new building and development, weather pattern changes, and other factors. The Risk MAP program assists communities nationwide to assess flood risks and encourages mitigation planning and actions to avoid or minimize damage in the face of future disasters. Through more precise flood maps, risk assessment tools, and outreach support, Risk MAP strengthens local communities’ ability to make informed decisions about reducing risk. The Risk MAP program includes collaboration with Federal, State, and local stakeholders in communities across the nation to identify, assess, communicate, and mitigate risks. The program aims to address gaps in flood hazard data, provide an enhanced digital platform for the information that is produced, and align risk analysis programs to enhance decision-making. Risk MAP works in conjunction with other FEMA initiatives and supports the NFIP in its efforts to encourage communities to become risk aware and resilient. To learn more about the Risk MAP program, go to http://www.fema.gov/risk-mapping-assessment-planning.  ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATOR The table below identifies the studies under which FEMA issued a preliminary FIRM and FIS report, initiated a 90-day appeal period, issued a revised preliminary FIRM and FIS report, or issued LFDs in December 2016.

Johnson hosting Fourth District Muslim & Refugee-Immigrant Listening Session   CLARKSTON, GA – On Sunday, February 12 from 4-7 p.m., Rep Hank Johnson (GA-04), along with Clarkston Mayor Ted Terry, is hosting a Fourth District Muslim and Refugee-Immigrant-Listening Session at the Clarkston Community Center to fight against the divisive Trump Administration and the GOP Congressional immigration and refugee policies.  “At a crucial time in our nation’s history when our Muslim, immigrant and refugee communities are under attack, now is the time for all good people to stand up and speak out,” said Johnson. “I fundamentally disagree with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith, religion or nationality.”  “Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Buddhists have been living peacefully, side by side, in our small 1.4 square mile town for decades,” said Terry. “Clarkston is committed to our core principles of welcoming others and compassionate action for all. We look forward to hearing the concerns of our community members during this harrowing time in our nation’s history. Hopefully future generations will look back kindly on this moment and say that we all did our part to fight for a more perfect union.”  Johnson said he wants to use this opportunity as a listening session to hear directly from people most affected by these draconian policies and hopes the larger community also comes out to listen and support immigrants and refugees as well. Representatives from local school boards, public safety and immigrant & refugee resettlement agencies will also be on hand.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154324303717006/?type=3",NA,66,11,44,13,0,0,0,0

CMS intends to invest up to an additional $80 million over the remaining four years.  These local, experienced, community-based organizations will provide hands-on training to help thousands of small practices, especially those that practice in historically under-resourced areas including rural areas, health professional shortage areas, and medically underserved areas. The training and education resources will be available immediately, nationwide, and will be provided at no cost to eligible clinicians and practices.  “Clinicians in small and rural practices are critical to serving the millions of Americans across the nation who rely on Medicare for their health care,” said Dr. Kate Goodrich, CMS Chief Medical Officer and Director of the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality. “Congress, through the bipartisan Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, recognized the importance of small practices and rural practices and provided the funding for this assistance, so clinicians in these practices can navigate the new program, while being able to focus on what matters most -- the needs of their patients.”  The selected organizations will provide customized technical assistance to clinicians and practices to help them be successful in the Quality Payment Program. For example, clinicians will receive help choosing and reporting on quality measures, as well as guidance with all aspects of the program, including supporting change management and strategic planning and assessing and optimizing health information technology.  This funding is one part of a multi-level outreach effort to help clinicians understand and provide feedback about the new Quality Payment Program. Through webinars and in-person presentations, thousands have received free training and education from CMS staff since the Quality Payment Program Final Rule was released last October. In addition, through the established Quality Innovation Networks, the Transforming Clinical Practice Initiatives, and the Alternative Payment Model Learning Systems, every clinician in the Quality Payment Program can receive in-person training, including information about the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, as well as the Alternative Payment Model track.  As part of that outreach effort, CMS also launched a new telephone helpline for clinicians seeking assistance with the Quality Payment Program. Clinicians may contact the Quality Payment Program by calling 1-866-288-8292 from 8AM – 8PM EST or emailing qpp@cms.hhs.gov.  CMS awarded contracts to the following organizations to provide the on-the-ground training and education to small practices: •    Altarum •    Georgia Medical Care Foundation (GMCF) •    HealthCentric •    Health Services Advisory Group (HSAG) •    IPRO •    Network for Regional Healthcare Improvement (NRHI) •    QSource •    Qualis •    Quality Insights (West Virginia Medical Institute) •    Telligen •    TMF Health Quality Institute","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154359864937006/?type=3",NA,2,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

Only 8: Number of bills signed into law, including 3 GOP special-interest bills, overturning Obama-era protections (one a gift to the coal industry, jeopardizing clean drinking water for millions; one a gift to Big Oil and Gas, eliminating a key anti-corruption rule; and one a gift to the Gun Lobby, weakening the Brady Background Check System); 4 noncontroversial suspensions; and a bill providing an exemption for General Mattis from the requirement that anyone serving as Secretary of Defense not be in active service for the prior seven years.  More than 125: House Democrats have called for the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for lying under oath to the Senate and the American people about his communications with the Russians during the presidential campaign.  4: Times House Republicans blocked bringing up a bill to rescind President Trump’s dangerous and unconstitutional Muslim and Refugee Ban; days later 2 GOP-appointed and 2 Democratic-appointed federal judges ruled that enforcement of the ban must stop (Congressional Record H717, 2017 Vote #68, 2017 Vote #70, 2017 Vote #74).  ZERO: Times Speaker Paul Ryan spoke out in opposition to President Trump’s dangerous and unconstitutional Muslim and Refugee Ban.   ZERO:  Number of bills to create jobs the House Republican Leadership has brought to the House Floor.  4: Times Republicans voted to block bringing up a bill to create a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election (2017 Vote #26, 2017 Vote #88, 2017 Vote #93, 2017 Vote #115).   ZERO: Times Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republican Leaders demanded an investigation into Russia’s efforts to interfere in the elections last November.  3: Times Republicans voted for measures attacking women’s health care so far in this Congress, including votes to start the ACA repeal process, place restrictions on how women can spend private dollars in purchasing health insurance, and to reduce the access of millions of women to family planning  (2017 Vote #56, 2017 Vote #65, 2017 Vote #99).   2: House Republicans joined 163 House Democrats on a letter urging the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to ask for copies of President Trump’s tax documents.   2: Times Republicans blocked a vote on a bill to require Presidents and candidates for President to disclose their tax returns – despite the fact that 72 percent of Americans want Presidents to disclose their tax returns (2017 Vote #62, 2017 Vote #103).  227: Republicans voted for a measure that starts a GOP process to repeal the ACA without a comprehensive replacement with only 51 votes in the Senate – despite CBO stating it would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million and double premiums in the individual market by 2026.  229: Republicans voted to overturn a critical rule to make Brady background checks more effective and efficient, by ensuring the names of those prohibited from having guns under federal law are submitted to the background check system – despite 93 percent of Americans supporting these background checks.   230: Republicans voted to overturn key anti-corruption provisions that require disclosure of payments by big oil and gas companies to foreign governments for access to natural resources, provisions strongly opposed by Big Oil and Gas.  224: Republicans voted to overturn, at the behest of corporate interests, a key rule to protect the drinking water, health, and environment of the people of Appalachia who live near mountaintop removal mining sites, who have suffered elevated levels of lung cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and birth defects.  234: Republicans voted to strike a critical rule to uphold the accountability provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act, thereby undoing key protections for disadvantaged students.  100: Percent of Republicans who voted against an amendment that would stop efforts to weaken commonsense rules that limit conflicts of interests between Executive Branch employees.  119: Republicans (a majority) voted in an internal House Conference meeting to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) before public outrage forced GOP leadership to change course.  231: Republicans voted to prohibit agencies from publicly discussing or disclosing any information that could be interpreted as promoting or generating support for any regulatory action by an agency.  100: Percent of Republicans that voted to prevent independent agencies from moving forward with safeguards and regulations without a stamp of approval from the White House.    227: Republicans  voted to overturn a critical workplace safety rule that clarified employers have a continuing obligation to record injuries and illness even if they are not always in compliance with OSHA’s recordkeeping requirement.","status",NA,NA,12,4,7,0,0,2,0,2

In an interview with The Progressive, Johnson said he had been impressed by Cáceres, calling her a “very kind, warm-hearted woman, but a woman of determination, of great courage.”  When it became clear the State Department would not adjust its policy on Honduras, Johnson introduced the “Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras” Act in June 2016. The bill called for a suspension of all military aid to Honduras until the country addressed its human rights violations. Last year, the U.S. provided $18 million of support to military and police, the largest contribution of any foreign country.  On March 2, the anniversary of her murder, Johnson reintroduced the bill, and vowed to continue to press the issue.  “We have a moral responsibility to make sure our money is not being spent to promote violence against human rights activists,” Johnson said. “That’s what’s happening in Honduras, that’s what’s been happening for years.”","link","http://progressive.org/dispatches/the-legacy-of-a-fighter-berta-caceres-didn%E2%80%99t-die-she-multipl/","progressive.org",2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0

The risk of falling furniture is one such source. Every 30 minutes tipped furniture or a falling TV sends an injured child to the emergency room. On aver-age, one child dies every two weeks when a TV or furniture falls onto him or her. Ninety-one percent of these fatalities occur in the home. In light of these facts, CPSC launched Anchor It! - a public education campaign to prevent furniture and TV tip-overs from killing and seriously injuring children. This is one of the top hidden hazards in the home, and CPSC’s safety campaign is aimed at reducing the number of deaths and injuries from tipping furniture and TVs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154420505067006/?type=3",NA,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Under the PPPA, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued regulations that require child-resistant packaging for about 30 categories of medicines and hazardous household products. Child fatalities have declined substantially since CPSC was charged with administering the PPPA in 1972—from 216 that year, to an average of about 31 each year from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013. There has been a 40 percent decline in aspirin poisonings alone with the use of child-resistant closures.  Exposure to the harmful contents of laundry packets has resulted in reports of loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing, throat swelling, excessive vomiting, and temporary vision loss. In 2015, laundry packets were the third leading cause of unintentional pediatric poisoning. CPSC is aware of at least one death relating to ingestion of a laundry packet, a 7-month-old Florida boy who died after swallowing the contents of the packet.  CPSC worked closely with child safety advocates, the cleaning products industry, and ASTM International to develop a new safety standard that will help prevent exposure to the contents of the packets.  March 19-25 is National Poison Prevention Week. Nine out of 10 poison incidents involving children occur in the home. Unintentional poisonings are preventable. To reduce the risk of unintentional poisoning, think beyond the medicine and kitchen cabinets. Here are some useful tips to prevent unintentional poisonings:  Always use and re-seal child safety caps.  Lock up poisons and medicines. Keep them out of a child’s sight and reach.  Never call medicine “candy.”  Keep medicines in their original child resistant containers. Don’t trans-fer them to bottles, pill organizers, cups or non-child-resistant containers.  Store detergent packages away from the sight and reach of children. These packages are enticing to young children who might mistake them for candy.  Keep the Poison Help hotline number 1-800-222-1222 nearby. Call your local poison center in case of poison emergency.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154420537672006/?type=3",NA,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Due to delays caused by both Executive Orders, the refugee-arrival ceiling (originally set at 110,000 for fiscal year 2017) has seen drastic decreases, meaning far fewer refugees will be welcomed to the U.S. in the coming months.

Portable medical oxygen is used by an increasing number of people, and households that use it need to be aware of the risks. Here are some fire safety tips for medical oxygen: - Don’t smoke around medical oxygen, as fire needs oxygen to burn. When more oxygen is in the air, any fire that starts will burn hotter and faster than usual. There is no safe way to smoke in the home when medical oxygen is in use. - Put a “No Smoking” sign inside and outside homes where medical oxygen is used. - Candles, matches, wood stoves and even sparking toys, can spark and start a fire. They should not be used in a home where medical oxygen is used. - Keep medical oxygen cylinders at least five (5) feet from a heat source, open flames or electrical devices. - Body oil, hand lotion, and items containing oil and grease can easily catch on fire.

Unfortunately, there are few programs and policies to help parents balance the demands of work and family, which can particularly penalize women.  Enacting paid family and medical leave, expanding access to quality, affordable child care, and strengthening anti-discrimination laws could help women remain in the labor market and consequently narrow the gender wage gap. #EqualPayDay","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154473732732006/?type=3",NA,7,7,7,1,0,1,0,0

Avoid interest and penalties; limit interest charges and late payment penalties; Claim a Refund; Protect Social Security Benefits and Avoid Issues Obtaining Loans.  • What to do if you owe more than you can pay?  You can request an additional 60-120 days to pay your account in full through the Online Payment Agreement application or by calling 800-829-1040; no user fee will be charged. If you need more time to pay, you can request an installment agreement or you may qualify for an offer in compromise. • What If You Don’t File Voluntarily?

USCIS will begin issuing the new cards on May 1, 2017. These redesigns use enhanced graphics and fraud-resistant security features to create cards that are highly secure and more tamper-resistant than the cards currently in use. The new card designs demonstrate USCIS’ commitment to taking proactive approaches against the threat of document tampering, counterfeiting, and fraud. They are also part of an ongoing effort between USCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enhance document security and deter counterfeiting and fraud. The Redesigned Cards  The new Green Cards and EADs will: • Display the individual’s photos on both sides; • Show a unique graphic image and color palette: o Green Cards will have an image of the Statue of Liberty and a predominately green palette; o EAD cards will have an image of a bald eagle and a predominately red palette; • Have embedded holographic images; and • No longer display the individual’s signature.  Also, Green Cards will no longer have an optical stripe on the back.  How To Tell If Your Card Is Valid  Some Green Cards and EADs issued after May 1, 2017, may still display the existing design format, as USCIS will continue using existing card stock until current supplies are depleted. Both the existing and the new Green Cards and EADs will remain valid until the expiration date shown on the card. Both the new and existing versions of the Green Card and EAD are acceptable for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification and E-Verify. Some older Green Cards do not have an expiration date. These older Green Cards without an expiration date also remain valid.

Scammers have identified themselves as “U.S. Immigration” employees and have altered their caller ID to seem like the call is coming from the DHS OIG hotline (1-800-323-8603).   They then demand that the individual provide or verify personally identifiable information, often by telling individuals that they are victims of identity theft.  If a Scammer Calls You  If you receive a call demanding personal information or payment, hang up immediately. If you want to verify whether a call is from USCIS, you may: * Call our National Customer Service Center at 800-375-5283 to ask if you need to do anything about your case or immigration status, * Make an InfoPass appointment at http://infopass.uscis.gov, or * Use myUSCIS to find up-to-date information about your application.  Remember, USCIS officials will never threaten you or ask for payment over the phone or in an email. If we need payment, we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment. Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USCIS official. In general, we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area.  How to Report a Call from a Scammer  If you receive a scam email or phone call, report it to the Federal Trade Commission at http://1.usa.gov/1suOHSS. If you are not sure if it is a scam, forward the suspicious email to the USCIS webmaster at uscis.webmaster@uscis.dhs.gov. USCIS will review the emails received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate.

It only takes one hurricane to change your life and your community. Hurricanes are one of nature's most powerful and destructive events that the nation faces, and the cause behind eight of the ten costliest disasters in U.S. history. Hurricanes are not just a coastal concern. High winds, heavy rainfall, tornadoes, and flooding can be felt hundreds of miles inland, potentially causing loss of life and catastrophic damage to property.  Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends November 30. Now is the time to prepare, if you -- or a close family member -- live in an area prone to hurricanes or inland flooding. Make a family emergency communication plan. Don't forget to include your pets in your emergency preparedness planning. Identify an out of town emergency contact to coordinate information with family and friends. Keep an emergency kit where you spend time -- home, car, work.

CPSC has evidence that LayZ Board was the hoverboard involved in the tragic fire on March 10, 2017, in Harrisburg, Pa., which took the lives of two young girls.  The LayZ Board is a two-wheeled, battery-powered, self-balancing scooter that has a pivoting platform intended for the rider’s feet and does not have a handlebar. The name LayZ Board appears on the front of the product. These hoverboards were manufactured in Shenzhen, China, and more than 3,000 units were imported into the United States.  Due to the fire hazard posed to consumers of all ages by these hoverboards, CPSC is urging the public to stop charging and stop using their LayZ Board.   Consumers who choose to dispose of their hoverboards should take them to a local recycling center for safe handling of the lithium-ion battery. CPSC is also asking the public to share this warning with friends and family so that no one else is injured by them.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154585203772006/?type=3",NA,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

While summer usually means vacations, there is no vacation from fire safety.   Each year, grill fires cause about $37 million in property damage. Most of the fires happen between May and August.  Individuals can protect families and property by following a few grilling safety tips: - Only use grills outdoors, away from siding and deck railings. - Clean grills often and remove grease or fat build-up. - Make sure the gas grill lid is open before lighting. - Have a three foot safe-zone around grills and campfires.   Keep kids and pets clear of the area. - Dispose of coals after they have cooled in a metal can. - Never leave grills, fire pits, and patio torches unattended.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154640948977006/?type=3",NA,4,2,1,0,0,0,0,0

These 10 grants, which include the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) Grant Program and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), will provide more than $1.6 billion in funding to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as well as transportation authorities and nonprofit organizations to improve the nation’s readiness in preventing, protecting against, responding to, recovering from and mitigating terrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies.  Receiving an appropriation on May 5, 2017, this year’s DHS Preparedness Grant Program cycle has the shortest turn around since the program’s inception in 2003. To properly administer these grants with critical in-depth application reviews and award processes, the application period has been reduced to 21 days.  DHS is continuing to develop the policy and procedural mechanisms for implementing the sanctuary jurisdiction provisions of Executive Order No. 13768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States (Jan. 25, 2017). The Department is currently enjoined by a federal court from applying the operative provision of the order. Therefore, these 2017 grants will not be subject to the requirements of Section 9 (Sanctuary Jurisdictions) of the Executive Order.  To review the FY2017 Preparedness Grant NOFOs, go to www.grants.gov. After the application period closes on June 22, 2017, the applications will undergo critical, in-depth reviews. All awards for these grants will be made no later than September 30, 2017.","link","http://www.grants.gov/","grants.gov",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0

The online account allows individual taxpayers to access the latest information available about their federal tax account through a secure and convenient tool on IRS.gov. When it first launched in December 2016, the tool assisted taxpayers with basic account inquiries such as information about their balance due and access to the various IRS payment options.   Since then, the IRS has added new features allowing taxpayers to: • View up to 18 months of tax payment history • View payoff amounts and tax balance due for each tax year • Obtain online transcripts of various Form 1040-series through Get Transcript  • Give feedback on their experience with their online account and make suggestions for improvements   “We are constantly looking for ways to improve taxpayers’ interactions with the IRS and adding these new features to the taxpayer’s online account is an important step in that direction,” said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. “The IRS is committed to serving taxpayers in multiple ways and now taxpayers who want to interact digitally with us in a secure environment have access to even more helpful features.”   Before accessing the tool, taxpayers must authenticate their identities through the rigorous Secure Access process. This is a two-step authentication process, which means returning users must have their credentials (username and password) plus a security code sent as a text to their mobile phones.  Taxpayers who have registered using Secure Access for Get Transcript Online or Get an IP PIN may use their same username and password. To register for the first time, taxpayers must have their personal and financial information including: Social Security number, specific financial information, such as a credit card number or loan numbers, email address and a text-enabled mobile phone in the user's name.   Taxpayers may review the Secure Access  process prior to starting registration.  As part of the security process to authenticate taxpayers, the IRS will send verification, activation or security codes via email and text.   The IRS warns taxpayers that it will not initiate contact via text or email asking for log-in information or personal data. The IRS texts and emails will only contain one-time codes.  In addition to the online account, the IRS continues to provide several self-service tools and helpful resources available on IRS.gov for individuals, businesses and tax professionals.","link","https://www.irs.gov/uac/view-your-tax-account","irs.gov",7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unsuspecting callers may be targeted by these Caller ID Spoofing activities and be tricked into giving away personal information or make payments to settle false warrants by potential identify thieves. Identity thieves will often pose as representatives from banks, credit card companies, creditors or government agencies to get people to volunteer their personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and passwords.  The USCP has been made aware of and is investigating incidents in which offenders have spoofed USCP phone numbers. As part of the fraudulent activities, the offenders have requested money from individuals to settle a fictitious warrant with the USCP. Offenders have requested different forms of payment including wired funds, bit-coins, and various types of gift cards.  At no time would any United States Capitol Police employee request any form of monetary compensation over the phone to settle a warrant, pay a fine, or resolve any criminal matters.  Do not provide personal information over the telephone to any company or government agency seeking it; instead end the call immediately. If you can identify the company or agency seeking the information, you may want to call the company/agency and ask a customer representative if the information that was being requested is actually required from you.  If you receive a call and you suspect the Caller ID information has been falsified, you can file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. • File a complaint online (https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us) • By phone: 1-888-CALL-FCC (1-888-225-5322); TTY: 1-888-TELL-FCC (1-888-835-5322) • By mail (please include your name, address, contact information and as much detail as possible):  Federal Communications Commission Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau Consumer Inquiries and Complaints Division 445 12th Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20554","link","https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us","consumercomplaints.fcc.gov",4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

This represents a decrease of approximately $1.20 below the actual average premium of $34.70 in 2017.  “We are committed to making prescription drug plan premiums affordable so that seniors and people with disabilities in Medicare can access the prescription drugs that they need,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. “This projection is a step forward in fulfilling the Trump Administration’s promise to lower the cost of prescription drug coverage, particularly for Medicare beneficiaries.”  The decline in the average premium comes despite the fact that spending for the Part D program continues to increase faster than spending for other parts of Medicare, largely driven by spending on high-cost specialty drugs. As the recent 2017 Medicare Trustees reported noted, growth in Medicare spending on prescription drugs continues to exceed growth in other Medicare spending and in overall U.S. healthcare spending. The projection for the average premium for 2018 is based on bids submitted by drug plans for basic drug coverage for the 2018 benefit year and calculated by the independent CMS Office of the Actuary.  The upcoming annual Medicare open enrollment period begins on October 15, 2017, and ends on December 7, 2017. During this time, Medicare beneficiaries can choose health and drug plans for 2018 by comparing their current coverage and plan quality ratings to other plan offerings or choose to remain in traditional Medicare. CMS anticipates releasing the premiums and costs for Medicare health and drug plans for the 2018 calendar year in mid-September.  To view the 2018 Part D base beneficiary premium, the Part D national average monthly bid amount, the Part D regional low-income premium subsidy amounts, the de minimis amount, the Part D income-related monthly adjustment amounts, the Medicare Advantage employer group waiver plan regional payment rates, and the Medicare Advantage regional PPO benchmarks, visit: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Ratebooks-and-Supporting-Data.html and select “2018.”","link","https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Ratebooks-and-Supporting-Data.html","cms.gov",6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ensure the helmet fits properly and is worn every time they ride.  Playgrounds  Have 9 –12 inches of shock-absorbing material (e.g., wood chips, mulch, rubber mats) under the playground.  Make sure there is no exposed hardware to catch clothing and no free hanging ropes at-tached to equipment.  Don’t let children play on hot surfaces.  Clothing  Never buy/allow kids to wear clothes with drawstrings around the hood/neck—this can be a strangulation risk!  Distracted Walking  Children are getting hurt from using their smartphones and tablets while crossing intersections. Teach them to look both ways for oncoming vehicle traffic and pay attention to their surroundings.  Emergency Plan  If kids are home alone (before or after school), they should know what to do in an emergency. Have an escape plan for fires and other emergencies. Kids should know the plan and drill it occasionally.  Teach children to call 911 and alert emergency services.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154843693512006/?type=3",NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A message from U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission   Living off-campus while away at school is an exciting time in a college student’s life. Off-campus living may pose some hazards. One such hazard is the risk of fire.  According to a study by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), 94 percent of fatal campus fires from 2000-2015 took place in off-campus housing. That same study showed 58 percent of fatal campus fires had no smoke alarms or smoke alarms that did not have working batteries.  USFA’s study also found that alcohol and smoking materials were involved in the majority of the fires. Sadly, last year, a Southern Illinois University student died in an off-campus house fire, and just this year, an Oregon college student, died in an off-campus apartment fire.  To help prevent these tragedies, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has teamed up with USFA, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and Campus Firewatch to help get the message out about off-campus housing fire hazards. The See It Before You Sign It campaign encourages parents to take a more active role in helping their student find firesafe housing.  It is important never to sign a lease until you have seen the housing.  Once you see the house or apartment, make sure it has:   Working smoke alarms in every sleeping room, as well as outside each sleeping area and on each level of the apartment or house.  Test the alarms on a monthly basis.  Fire sprinklers  Two ways out of each room for a safe escape. In addition:  Make sure all windows and doors open easily.  Make sure housing can handle the power demands for your computers, phones, TVs, etc.  Ask the landlord pointed questions about fire safety.  And, always keep an eye on food when it is cooking.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154843722547006/?type=3",NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Social Security has never missed a payment – and you cannot outlive your earned, inflation-adjusted benefits. Three-fifths of older Americans rely on Social Security for a majority of their retirement income, 1 in 3 for 90% or more. For 1 in 5 retirees, it is their only income.2 Social Security is even more important as retirees age. It is the major source of income for 72% of those over age 80, and 90% or more for 42%.  #3: Social Security is Especially Important for Women: Women earn less (80 cents on the dollar and even less for women of color – African American women earn 63 cents and Latinas earn 54 cents on the dollar),4 are less likely to have a pension, and live on average 2.3 years longer than men. They rely on Social Security’s lifelong, inflation-adjusted benefits – for 3 out of 10 older women, Social Security is virtually their sole source of income. And 97% of those who receive survivor benefits are women.  #4: Social Security Serves the Veterans who Served Our Nation: More than 9 million veterans – nearly 1 in 5 of covered adults – receive Social Security benefits.6,7 More than 1 million veterans receive SSDI,8 and the Social Security provides critical survivor benefits to the children of military men and women killed while fighting for their country.  #5: Social Security Matters to Communities of Color: Social Security is especially important for workers with low earnings and less access to pensions. Social Security’s retirement benefits represent 90% or more of income for 45% of African Americans, 52% of Latinos, and 41% of Asian Americans.  #6: Social Security Protects Children: An estimated 6.4 million children under age 18 benefit from Social Security,10 either because they receive benefits themselves or live in families where Social Security provides some or all household income. In addition, Social Security provides benefits to 140,000 students age 18 and 19.  #7: Social Security is There for Disabled Workers: Nearly 11 million disabled workers and their families receive Social Security Disability Insurance benefits.12 80% rely on their earned benefits for the majority of their income, 1 in 3 for all of their income. 69% of civilian workers have no other form of employer-based long-term disability insurance.  #8: Social Security Fights Poverty: Social Security lifts 22 million Americans – including more than 1 million children and 9 million older women – out of poverty. Two out of five older Americans would be living in poverty without it.   #9: Social Security is Efficient: Since 1989, administrative costs have represented 1% or less of total expenditures. In 2016, they were seven-tenths of a percentage.15 Social Security is self-funded. By law, it cannot borrow or add to the deficit.  #10: Social Security Helps Local Economies: This year, Social Security estimates it will pay $955 billion in earned benefits.16 The vast majority of dollars are spent on goods and services, helping our local economy. A 2013 AARP study found that every dollar in benefits equals $2 in economic input, with Social Security creating more than 9 million jobs and $1 trillion in economic output.  https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf","link","https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf","ssa.gov",13,1,2,1,0,0,0,1

Through various initiatives Congressman Johnson seeks to increase awareness and support for this business segment among educators, community/economic development specialists, local leaders, and community members. The “Advancement of the Small Business Community” initiative will be composed of a series of informative and interactive roundtable discussions, leading up to a district-wide ""Think Tank.""

HHS awards $2,354,620 to Georgia to improve health center quality  Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that $2,354,620 has been awarded to 32 health centers in Georgia as an investment in quality improvement, building upon their 2016 achievements.    Health centers will use these funds to further improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the health care delivered to the communities they serve.  This announcement comes during Health Center Week, the annual celebration of the high-quality, affordable, primary care health centers have been providing for more than 50 years.  “Americans deserve a healthcare system that’s affordable, accessible, of the highest quality, with ample choices, driven by world-leading innovations, and responsive to the needs of the individual patient,” said Secretary Price. “Supporting health centers across the country helps to achieve that mission.” Health centers are receiving these funds to continue improving their services based upon high levels of performance in one or more of the following categories: Improving Quality of Care, Increasing Access to Care, Enhancing Delivery of High Value Health Care, Addressing Health Disparities, and Achieving Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Recognition. “Today’s awards will help health centers to provide their communities with high quality, affordable primary care,” said HRSA Administrator Dr. George Sigounas. “Quality care remains a critical trait of the Health Center Program, especially because health centers are treating more patients than ever before.”  HRSA also released new data compiled from health centers through its Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting, providing an update on the primary care services being provided to patients.  In 2016, nearly 26 million people (approximately 1 in 12 U.S. residents) relied on a HRSA-funded health center for affordable, accessible primary health care including: • One in three people living in poverty; • One in ten U.S. children 17 years or younger; • One in six U.S. rural residents; and  • More than 330,000 U.S. veterans.  For more than 50 years, health centers have delivered affordable, accessible, quality, and cost-effective primary health care services to patients. Today, nearly 1,400 health centers operate more than 10,400 service delivery sites nationwide.

Through this policy, a community can ensure compliance with NFIP and local floodplain management regulations, while potentially reducing the administrative burden associated with permitting certain types of low-to-no impact development in the floodplain.

FEMA is currently heavily engaged in supporting the ongoing, life-saving efforts in response to the catastrophic effects resulting from Hurricane Harvey. The costs of these efforts are quickly drawing down the remaining balance in FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund.  FEMA implemented Immediate Needs Funding (INF) guidance in order to extend the remaining balance of the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) so that FEMA can continue its focus on response and urgent recovery efforts without interruption. INF is intended to meet the urgent needs of disaster survivors and will prioritize funding. There have been a number of times in the past where the agency found it necessary to issue INF allocation funding guidance, as a precautionary measure, to maintain an adequate DRF balance while awaiting passage of appropriations legislation.  Immediate needs funding does allow for the allocation of funds for Individual Assistance, Public Assistance Categories A and B (debris removal and emergency protective measures), technical assistance contract support for Public Assistance Categories A and B activities, technical assistance contract support for Individual Assistance manufactured housing support, state management costs, mission assignments, and essential joint field office (JFO) operations.  The limitation applies to specific disaster funding for permanent work (Public Assistance Categories C-G) the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, as well as DRF surge and disaster support activities.  Funding is not being eliminated for projects in these categories, but merely delayed until additional appropriations are available. Adhering to these guidelines is critical to ensure that FEMA is able to continue ongoing and future response and recovery efforts.

These members are supporting American Red Cross shelter and feeding operations and FEMA’s disaster damage assessments and logistics. Additionally, our AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team and FEMA Corps teams on are standby to deploy at the request of our partners at FEMA and state and local managers to support the impacted communities.   Local AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs have been mobilized to support the response in their local communities.   National service members are trained to support shelter operations, debris removal, volunteer and donations management, and other disaster survivor support needs. AmeriCorps and Senior Corps stand with the people of Texas and are prepared to support the long-term recovery in the weeks and months ahead.  Volunteering in Times of Disaster In times of disaster, we often see an outpouring of support as Americans try to find ways to help and support devastated communities.   Here are some reminders that we encourage you to share with your constituents on what they can do when disaster strikes. For more information go to www.nationalservice.gov/Harvey. • Do not self-deploy as a volunteer to a disaster area. During a disaster, food, water, shelter and transportation are at a premium and the first priority is making sure that first responders and local residents can get what they need. • Sign up before you show up. If you are able to volunteer, make sure to find an organization and sign up. Capacity is stretched during disasters and you need to make sure that you can be utilized. Visit our webpage for more information. • Donate cash. What most communities needs is cash, not things. Find a reputable local organization that is raising money for disaster response and recovery and contribute. If you need help selecting an organization to support, the Texas Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster website has a list of vetted disaster relief organizations that are providing services to affected residents. Texas VOAD represents more than three dozen faith-based, community, nonprofit and non-governmental organizations.  Safety Reminders • Remember, follow instructions from state, local, and tribal officials. If told to shelter in place or evacuate, do so immediately. Do not return to evacuated areas until told it is safe to do so. • There are historic levels of flooding being caused by this storm. If you encounter floodwaters, remember: Turn around, don’t drown.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154915850897006/?type=3",NA,5,2,0,2,0,0,0,0

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico early Wednesday, with hurricane conditions arriving later that day.  Destructive winds, storm surge, dangerous surf, heavy rainfall and flash flooding are possible.  There is an increasing chance of seeing impacts from Irma in parts of Florida later this week.  A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.      History shows that storm tracks can change quickly and unexpectedly.  Residents and visitors in areas potentially affected by the severe weather should continue to monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information, and follow the instructions of state, local, and tribal officials.    Be familiar with evacuation routes, have a family communications plan, keep a battery-powered radio handy and have a plan for pets. Visit www.ready.gov or www.listo.gov to learn these and other preparedness tips for tropical storms.

Follow these simple tips to keep babies sleeping safely:   To prevent suffocation, never place pillows or thick quilts in a baby’s sleep environment.   Make sure there are no gaps larger than two fingers between the sides of the crib and the mattress.   Do not use cribs older than 10 years or broken or modified cribs. Infants can strangle to death if their bodies pass through gaps between loose components of broken slats while their heads remain entrapped.   Set up play yards properly according to manufacturers’ directions. Only use mattress pads that are made to properly fit a play yard; do not add extra padding.   Never place a crib near a window with blinds, curtain cords, or baby monitor cords; babies can strangle on cords.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10154935303297006/?type=3",NA,6,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hank Johnson (GA-04) has launched his “Get Lit-A-Tour” to connect one-on-one with youth and young adults.   The creative play on words for the Lit-er-acy events will provide students with an opportunity to tour options that are available as they make critical decisions towards post-secondary education and future careers after high school.  The tour kicked off on August 25 at South DeKalb High School in Decatur. With the help of iHeart Radio, the 100 Black Men and celebrity disc jockey “DJ Scream,” the Congressman told hundreds of high schoolers about the importance of education and following their dreams.   Financial literacy and STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Art and Mathematics) education, were just two of the subjects discussed with students at the August 25 event.  “My office has already been very active in reaching out to our youth in separate capacities. This initiative brings all that work together under one roof,” said Rep. Johnson. “This is a new push to get youth and young adults on board with making a better way for themselves.”   Congressman Johnson has launched this initiative because he realizes that high school students may find it difficult to make decisive decisions when it comes to their many post-secondary options. The goal of this initiative is to share information that can ultimately help young people make educated decisions about their future, as well as, close the achievement gap in our communities.  The Get Lit-A-Tour will serve as an extension of the initiatives the Congressman currently offers to our youth and will be hosted at other schools in Georgia’s Fourth Congressional District in the near future.   Congressman Johnson will continue to reach out to youth through his annual Congressional Art Competition, Internship program, Service Academy, Congressional App Challenge, The Congressional Award; and other scholarship opportunities.    To date, Congressman Johnson has awarded over 26 million dollars in scholarships to deserving 4th Congressional District students.

All those in potentially affected areas should listen to the directions of state, local, territorial, and tribal officials. If told to evacuate, evacuate.  Storm tracks can change quickly and unexpectedly. Don’t be caught unaware. Take advantage of advance warning to get yourself and your family safe before it becomes too dangerous to do so.  If told to evacuate:  • Listen to a battery-powered radio and follow local evacuation instructions. • Call or email the out-of-state contact in your family communications plan. Tell them where you are going. • Secure your home by closing and locking doors and windows. • Unplug electrical equipment such as radios, televisions and small appliances. Leave freezers and refrigerators plugged in unless there is a risk of flooding. If there is damage to your home and you are instructed to do so, shut off water, gas and electricity before leaving. • Leave a note telling others when you left and where you are going. • Wear sturdy shoes and clothing that provides some protection such as long pants, long-sleeved shirts and a hat. • Check with neighbors who may need a ride. • Follow recommended evacuation routes. Do not take shortcuts; they may be blocked. • Be alert for road hazards such as washed-out roads or bridges and downed power lines. Do not drive into flooded areas.  For those in the Caribbean where the storm system is already impacting the area, remain in a safe shelter away from windows. Turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting and open only when necessary, so if you lose power, food will last longer. Keep a thermometer in the refrigerator to be able to check the food temperature when the power is restored. Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.  Download the FEMA mobile app (available in English and Spanish) for a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service.

The new Medicare card contains a unique, randomly-assigned number that replaces the current Social Security-based number.  CMS will begin mailing the new cards to people with Medicare benefits in April 2018 to meet the statutory deadline for replacing all existing Medicare cards by April 2019. In addition to today’s announcement, people with Medicare will also be able to see the design of the new Medicare card in the 2018 Medicare & You Handbook. The handbooks are being mailed and will arrive throughout September.  “The goal of the initiative to remove Social Security numbers from Medicare cards is to help prevent fraud, combat identify theft, and safeguard taxpayer dollars,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. “We’re very excited to share the new design.”  CMS has assigned all people with Medicare benefits a new, unique Medicare number, which contains a combination of numbers and uppercase letters. People with Medicare will receive a new Medicare card in the mail, and will be instructed to safely and securely destroy their current Medicare card and keep their new Medicare number confidential. Issuance of the new number will not change benefits that people with Medicare receive.    Healthcare providers and people with Medicare will be able to use secure look-up tools that will allow quick access to the new Medicare numbers when needed. There will also be a 21-month transition period where doctors, healthcare providers, and suppliers will be able to use either their current SSN-based Medicare Number or their new, unique Medicare number, to ease the transition.  This initiative takes important steps towards protecting the identities of people with Medicare. CMS is also working with healthcare providers to answer their questions and ensure that they have the information they need to make a successful transition to the new Medicare number.

This includes an additional filing extension for taxpayers with valid extensions that run out on Oct. 16, and businesses with extensions that ran out on Sept. 15. It parallels relief previously granted to Irma victims throughout Florida and in parts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and Harvey victims in parts of Texas.  For taxpayers in Georgia, this relief postpones various tax filing and payment deadlines that occurred starting on Sept. 7, 2017. As a result, affected individuals and businesses will have until Jan. 31, 2018, to file returns and pay any taxes that were originally due during this period.  This includes the Sept. 15, 2017 and Jan. 16, 2018 deadlines for making quarterly estimated tax payments. For individual tax filers, it also includes 2016 income tax returns that received a tax-filing extension until Oct. 16, 2017. The IRS noted, however, that because tax payments related to these 2016 returns were originally due on April 18, 2017, those payments are not eligible for this relief.  A variety of business tax deadlines are also affected including the Oct. 31 deadline for quarterly payroll and excise tax returns. Businesses with extensions also have the additional time including, among others, calendar-year partnerships whose 2016 extensions ran out on Sept. 15, 2017 and calendar-year tax-exempt organizations   whose 2016 extensions run out on Nov. 15, 2017. The disaster relief page has details on other returns, payments and tax-related actions qualifying for the additional time.   In addition, the IRS is waiving late-deposit penalties for federal payroll and excise tax deposits normally due during the first 15 days of the disaster period. Check out the disaster relief page for the time periods that apply to each jurisdiction.  The IRS automatically provides filing and penalty relief to any taxpayer with an IRS address of record located in the disaster area. Thus, taxpayers need not contact the IRS to get this relief. However, if an affected taxpayer receives a late filing or late payment penalty notice from the IRS that has an original or extended filing, payment or deposit due date falling within the postponement period, the taxpayer should call the number on the notice to have the penalty abated.  In addition, the IRS will work with any taxpayer who lives outside the disaster area but whose records necessary to meet a deadline occurring during the postponement period are located in the affected area.    Taxpayers qualifying for relief who live outside the disaster area need to contact the IRS at 866-562-5227. This also includes workers assisting the relief activities who are affiliated with a recognized government or philanthropic organization. It also includes tax professionals who, due to the disaster, are unable to meet a tax-filing or payment deadline for their clients who live or are located outside the disaster area.   Individuals and businesses who suffered uninsured or unreimbursed disaster-related losses can choose to claim them on either the return for the year the loss occurred (in this instance, the 2017 return normally filed next year), or the return for the prior year (2016). See Publication 547 for details.  The tax relief is part of a coordinated federal response to the damage caused by severe storms and flooding and is based on local damage assessments by FEMA.

Those interested in volunteering are requested to do so through organized volunteer organizations and not to self-deploy to affected regions. To help people affected by the storms, visit the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD). To help, remember:  - Cash is best. Financial contributions to recognized disaster relief organizations are the fastest, most flexible, and most effective method of donating. Organizations on the ground know what items and quantities are needed, often buy in bulk with discounts and, if possible, purchase through are businesses which support economic recovery.  - Confirm donations needed. Critical needs change rapidly – confirm needed items BEFORE collecting; pack and label carefully; confirm delivery locations; arrange transportation. Unsolicited goods NOT needed burden local organizations’ ability to meet survivors’ confirmed needs, drawing away valuable volunteer labor, transportation, and warehouse space.  - Connect to volunteer. Trusted organizations operating in the affected area know where volunteers are needed, and can ensure appropriate volunteer safety, training, and housing.  Thank you for your interest in helping the survivors of recent hurricane activity, there are other ways to help. When disaster strikes, America looks to FEMA to support survivors and first responders in communities all across the country. FEMA is currently seeking talented and hard-working people to help support the response and recovery.

The test will assess the readiness for distribution of the national level test message, as well as verify its delivery.  The EAS test is made available to radio, television, cable, and direct broadcast satellite systems, and is scheduled to last approximately one minute. The test’s message will be similar to the regular monthly test message of the EAS with which the public is familiar, only inserting the word “national.” “This is a national test of the Emergency Alert System. This is only a test.”  Significant coordination and regional testing has been conducted with the broadcast community and emergency managers in preparation for this EAS national test. The test is intended to ensure public safety officials have the methods and systems that will deliver urgent alerts and warnings to the public in times of an emergency or disaster. Periodic testing of public alert and warning systems is also a way to assess the operational readiness of the infrastructure required for the distribution of a national message and determine whether technological improvements are needed.  Conducting the test following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria will provide insight into the resiliency of our national-level alerting capabilities in impacted areas. The test will also provide valuable data into how the Integrated Public Alerts and Warning System performs during and following a variety of conditions. With two major hurricanes already making landfall, and a potential for two more impacting our nation, we need to have the ability to maintain the continuity of critical infrastructure under various conditions.  Receiving preparedness tips and timely information about weather conditions or other emergency events can make all the difference in knowing when to take action to be safe. FEMA and our partners are working to ensure alerts and warnings are received quickly through several different technologies, no matter whether an individual is at home, at school, at work, or out in the community. The FEMA App, which can be downloaded on both Android and Apple devices, is one way to ensure receipt of both preparedness tips and weather alerts. The FEMA App can be downloaded at https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app.  The back-up date for the test is October 4, 2017, at 2:20 pm EDT, in case the September 27 test is cancelled. More information on the IPAWS and Wireless Emergency Alerts is available at https://www.ready.gov/alerts.   This is the third mandatory nationwide test of the EAS. The first test was conducted in November 2011, in collaboration with the FCC, broadcasters, and emergency management officials. The second mandatory test was conducted in September 2016. You can also access a video, FEMA Accessible Emergency Alert System IPAWS Test Message, in American Sign Language.  In 2007, FEMA began modernizing the nation’s public alert and warning system by integrating new technologies into the existing alert systems. The new system, known as IPAWS became operational in 2011. Today, IPAWS supports more than 900 local, state, tribal, and federal users through a standardized message format. IPAWS enables public safety alerting authorities such as emergency managers, police, and fire departments to send the same alert and warning message over multiple communication pathways at the same time to citizens in harm’s way, helping to save lives.

Yesterday, FEMA Administrator Brock Long met with FEMA personnel and the governors of the USVI and Puerto Rico to get an update on the current situation, each governor’s priorities, and assess the progress of response and recovery efforts underway.  We are, again, reminded after witnessing Hurricane Maria’s destruction that the compassion and generosity of the American people is never more evident than during and after a disaster. It is through individuals, non-profits, faith- and community-based organizations, private sector partners, and governmental agencies working together that we will most effectively and efficiently help survivors cope with the impacts of these catastrophic storms.  The following information is provided to assist those who wish to contribute, whether through financial donation or personal volunteerism.  The fastest way to help   As with previous storms, the most effective means to support recovery of communities affected by Hurricane Maria is to donate time or money to trusted voluntary-, faith- and community-based charitable organizations. This gives these organizations the ability to purchase what survivors need right now. In addition, when these organizations purchase goods or services locally, they pump money back into the local and regional economy, helping businesses recover faster.  It is important to remember unsolicited donated goods (e.g., clothing, miscellaneous household items, mixed or perishable foodstuffs) require voluntary agencies to redirect valuable resources away from providing services to sort, package, transport, warehouse, and distribute items that may not meet the needs of disaster survivors.  Donate through a trusted organization   The National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) lists trusted organizations receiving donations, many of which are already coordinating relief and response efforts in the Caribbean. The NVOAD website has information on non-profit organizations accepting or registering individual in-kind donations here. For corporate donations connect here.  You may also make financial donations to a National VOAD member organization to help voluntary or charitable organizations continue to provide services to Hurricane Maria survivors.  Volunteering in Response to Hurricane Maria   Anyone seeking an opportunity to get involved in response and recovery operations is encouraged to volunteer with local and nationally known organizations. A list of volunteer websites is available at www.nvoad.org.  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands ask that volunteers not self-deploy, as unexpected arrival in affected communities creates additional burden for first responders. Those who wish to register to volunteer to support response efforts for Hurricane Maria can go here for Puerto Rico (https://prvoad.communityos.org/cms/irma) and here: (https://usvivoad.communityos.org/cms/irma) for the U.S. Virgin Islands.  To register as an affiliated volunteer with a voluntary or charitable organization, visit the National VOAD for a list of partners active in disaster. Alternatively, you may register your interest to volunteer here for partner organizations to reach out to you.

The purpose of the nationwide test is to ensure that the EAS remains an effective means of warning the public about emergencies.  Periodic testing of public alert and warning systems helps to assess the operational readiness of alerting infrastructure, and to identify any needed technological and administrative improvements.  FEMA will administer the nationwide test, in cooperation with the FCC and National Weather Service, and with the participation of broadcast TV, radio, cable, satellite, wireline video, and other service providers, known as EAS participants.  After the test, EAS participants are required to file reports with the FCC, which the agency will analyze to determine how the test performed.  FEMA’s nationwide test message will be similar to regular monthly EAS test messages, in that the public should receive both audio and on-screen text conveying that it is only a test.  The nationwide test message language will differ slightly as it will say, “This is a national test of the Emergency Alert System.  This is only a test.”   The test message will be transmitted in both English and Spanish, with EAS participants deciding which version to use for their communities.  The test is intended to last approximately one minute.  Emergency alerts are created and sent by authorized government agencies.  EAS participants receive the alerts through a central Internet-based system administered by FEMA or through local “over the air” monitoring sources.  EAS participants then disseminate the emergency alerts to affected communities.  The FCC prescribes technical and procedural rules for communications providers’ participation in this process.  Wireless Emergency Alerts will not be part of the test.  The back-up date for the test is October 4, 2017, in case the September 27 test is cancelled due to widespread severe weather or other significant events.

This important step gives these individuals and families who have been impacted by the hurricanes the opportunity to change their Medicare health and prescription drug plans and gain access to health coverage on the Exchange immediately if eligible for a special enrollment period.   “The lives of millions of Americans have been disrupted and impacted in some way by recent hurricanes,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. “Setting up special enrollment periods gives Medicare beneficiaries and individuals seeking coverage on the Federal Exchange the opportunity to access health coverage during this difficult time and when they need it the most. We remain committed to doing all we can to help support the areas and individuals affected by these historic and catastrophic hurricanes.”    CMS established the following special enrollment periods to support individuals impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria:     •         Medicare special enrollment period:  This special enrollment period will allow individuals affected by these hurricanes to enroll, dis-enroll or switch Medicare health or prescription drug plans. It is available at the start of the incident period and runs through the end of the calendar year. Individuals may contact 1-800-MEDICARE to request enrollment using this special enrollment opportunity.     •         Federal Health Insurance Exchange special enrollment period:  CMS created this special enrollment period for certain individuals impacted by these hurricanes who need to enroll in a 2017plan through the Exchange or make changes to their existing 2017 plan. This special enrollment period will apply to individuals who experienced a special enrollment period qualifying event between 60 days prior to the start date of the incident period and December 31, 2017, but were unable to complete the application, plan selection, and enrollment process due to a hurricane-related weather event in 2017. This special enrollment period will allow individuals impacted by the storms to select a new 2017 Exchange plan or make changes to their existing plan at any time through December, 31, 2017. Individuals affected by the storms may contact the Exchange Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 to enroll in a plan.   In addition to the special enrollment periods for the 2017, individuals who reside in or move from areas affected by a hurricane in 2017 will be eligible for a special enrollment period that extends the 2018 Annual Open Enrollment Period through December 31, 2017.  These individuals may contact the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 to request enrollment using this special enrollment period after December 15, 2017.    These special enrollment opportunities are in addition to the Medicare and Exchange annual Open Enrollment Periods this fall and any other enrollment period for which the individual may be eligible.  CMS will continue to examine the circumstances in the areas affected by hurricanes and will consider taking action that reaches beyond December 31, 2017, if needed.    Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, M.D., declared public health emergencies in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands – areas all impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. With the public health emergencies in effect, CMS has temporarily waived or modified certain Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program requirements to provide healthcare providers, facilities, and suppliers the flexibility they need so they can focus on the health and safety of those impacted by the hurricanes.

Republicans in Congress have spent all their time this year trying to take healthcare away from millions of Americans and failed. But by undermining the Affordable Care Act, they are creating uncertainty in the market and undermining our entire healthcare system. I will continue advocating for the Fourth District to ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need to live healthy, productive lives.

LITHONIA, GA – Capt. Barrington Irving, the youngest person and the first African-American pilot to fly solo around the world, has partnered with Fourth Congressional District Rep. Hank Johnson (GA-04) and his Full STEAM Ahead Initiative.     Congressman Johnson’s initiative was created to inspire youth in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. Through this partnership with Capt. Irving and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, Congressman Johnson hopes to inspire students to explore the field of aviation and related careers.     On Tuesday, October 17, Mr. Irving presented his inspirational message through the ‘Mitsubishi Dream & Soar: Youth in Aviation’ to more than 500 students at Martin Luther King, Jr. High School in Lithonia.  “Through my STEAM initiative, I’m working to eliminate disparities in the workforce by exposing our students to opportunities such as aviation and other STEAM-related careers,” said Rep. Johnson. “Barrington is the embodiment of what someone interested and engaged in STEM fields early in life can accomplish. The skies the limit.”     Capt. Irving, who was mentored by a commercial airlines pilot, is the founder of the Miami-based Experience Aviation program designed to build math, science, reading and problem-solving skills in young people. He began Experience Aviation after his 97-day, history-making global flight as a 23-year-old pilot in 2007.     “I believe the sponsorship by MHIA is allowing me to get my educational and motivational message out to a growing number of students and to introduce them to careers in aviation. I want to show them that pursuing a career in this exciting industry can enable them to realize their dreams – just as I did,” said Irving.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.10155039554867006.1073741887.115356957005/10155039554922006/?type=3",NA,8,1,1,2,0,0,0,0

These fires caused approximately 25 deaths, 125 injuries, and $83 million in property loss.  In order to keep your family safe, consider the following Halloween fire safety tips: - Choose a costume without long trailing fabric. If you make your own costume, use materials that won’t catch on fire easily if they come in contact with heat or flames. - Give your children flashlights or glow sticks so they can see where they are going. - Keep decorations away from candles, light bulbs, or heat producing equipment.  - Consider using battery-operated flameless candles or glow sticks in your jack-o-lantern.  - Keep exits clear of decorations and furnishings.  - Make sure your smoke alarms operate properly, and replace them when they are ten years old.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10155056419807006/?type=3",NA,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s unfair to expect a small-town family business to pay their fair share while billions of dollars remain unaccounted for from multinational giants. We want our tax priorities to invest in the middle class and working families while holding the top earners accountable for their contribution to the country.   The Congressional Progressive Caucus believes that all Americans deserve a shot at success, not a rigged economy favoring the wealthy. Rather than give corporations and the top 1% a windfall, we should increase transparency, demand accountability, and, most important of all, invest in our people.  Special interests and some of the wealthiest in our country are supporting the GOP to create a plan that will change very little for working families. With 80% of all proposed tax cuts benefiting only the top 1% of the country, it’s time to call this plan what it is: a GOP giveaway.","status",NA,NA,33,10,5,4,0,0,0,0

Report name changes. Recently married or divorced taxpayers who change their name should notify the Social Security Administration. They should also notify the SSA if a dependent’s name changed.  This is to ensure that when the taxpayer files next year, the new name on the tax return matches. A mismatch between the name shown on their tax return and the SSA records can cause problems in the processing of their tax return and may even delay their tax refund.  Renew Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. Taxpayers who use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number should check to see if their number expired in 2016 or will expire this year. If so, and they need to file a return in 2018, they should apply now to renew their ITIN to avoid certain disallowed tax credits and processing delays next year. Taxpayers who have not used their ITIN to file a federal return at least once in the last three years will see their number expire Dec. 31, 2017. Also, ITINs with middle digits 70, 71, 72 or 80 will expire at the end of the year. Only taxpayers with expiring ITINs need to take any action. To renew an ITIN, a taxpayer must complete a Form W-7 and submit required documentation. No tax return is required for an application to renew.  Notify IRS of an address change. Four ways to notify IRS of an address change can be found at Frequently Asked Questions and Answers.   Get documentation of tax deductible charitable contributions.  Throughout the year, many taxpayers contribute money or gifts to qualified organizations eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions. For more information about records needed to verify a deduction, see Gifts to Charity: Six Facts About Written Acknowledgements     IRS YouTube Videos  • Changed Your Name after Marriage or Divorce? – English – Spanish –  ASL • Individual Tax Identification Number – English – Spanish   • Charitable Contributions – English   E-File closes on Nov. 18; after that, disaster victims, others need to file on paper  The system that processes electronically-filed individual returns, will shut down after Nov. 18 so the agency can perform annual maintenance and to enable the IRS to reprogram the system for the upcoming 2018 tax-filing season.  As a result, any taxpayer needing to file after Nov. 18 will need to do so on paper.  For details, see IR-2017-183.  Tax benefits for education  The IRS Data Retrieval Tool is available to use with the 2018‒19 Free Application for Federal Student Aid Form. Additional security and privacy protections have been added to address concerns that data from the tool could be used by identity thieves to file fraudulent tax returns.  The tool enables users to get their 2015 Tax Return Information for the 2016–17 and 2017–18 FAFSA. The IRS Data Retrieval Tool remains the fastest, most accurate way to input your tax return information into the FAFSA form.

Starting at age 70 ½, a minimum distribution is required each year from an IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, or retirement account. Withdrawals will be included in taxable income except for any part that was taxed before or that can be received tax-free (such as qualified distributions from designated Roth accounts). More than the minimum required amount can be withdrawn.   For information on calculating the required minimum distribution, when the first distribution must be taken, and more see: Retirement Topics – Required Minimum Distributions.

Michael Flynn proves there was a conspiracy by the Trump transition team to undermine and subvert a sitting President's conducting of American foreign policy. Flynn's guilty plea also proves that the Trump transition team colluded with the Russian government to neutralize U.S. sanctions. It galls me to read Flynn's statement accompanying his guilty plea where he sanctimoniously proclaims that his actions were not treasonous. Most Americans would agree that Flynn and the Trump transition team's collusion with a foreign enemy was high treason and that Mike Flynn is getting off easy. However, Flynn's favorable plea bargain is a small price to pay for his ongoing cooperation which, I am certain, has disrupted the blissful comfort of his coconspirators, who must now certainly know that their day of reckoning will not be postponed much longer.

The guiding principle behind the program is to build library collections, but I must say the short tour served as a great opportunity to talk to some of country’s future leaders.

After several years of no increase or very small increases, Social Security benefits will increase by 2% in 2018 due to the Cost of Living adjustment. Therefore, some beneficiaries who were held harmless against Part B premiums increases in prior years will have a premium increase in 2018.    The 30% of all Part B enrollees who are not subject to the “hold harmless” provision will pay the full premium of $134.00 per month in 2018. Part B enrollees who were held harmless in 2016 and 2017 will see an increase in the monthly Part B premium from the roughly $109.00, on average, they paid in 2017. An estimated 42% of all Part B enrollees are subject to the hold harmless provision in 2018 but will pay the full monthly premium of $134.00, because the increase in their Social Security benefit will be greater than or equal to an increase in their Part B premiums up to the full 2018 amount. About 28% of all Part B enrollees are subject to the hold harmless provision in 2018 and will pay less than the full monthly premium of $134, because the increase in their Social Security benefit will not be large enough to cover the full Part B premium increase.   Since 2007, beneficiaries with higher incomes have paid higher Medicare Part B monthly premiums. These income-related monthly adjustment amounts (IRMAA) affect roughly 5% of people with Medicare Part B.   Additionally, although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administer the Medicare program, premium and IRMAA charges fall under the purview of the Social Security Administration (SSA). Should your constituents have additional questions regarding their premium payment amount, please have them contact SSA directly at 1-800-772-1213. They may also visit their local SSA office.","status",NA,NA,4,2,2,0,0,0,0,0

A fresh tree is green, its needles are hard to pull from branches, and its needles do not break when bent between your fingers. The bottom of a fresh tree is sticky with resin and, when tapped on the ground, the tree should not lose many needles.  When setting up a tree at home, DO place it away from heat sources, such as fireplaces, vents and radiators. Because heated rooms rapidly dry out live trees, be sure to monitor water levels and keep the tree stand filled with water. Place the tree out of the way of traffic and do not block doorways.  When purchasing an artificial tree, DO look for the label ""Fire Resistant."" Although this label does not mean that the tree will not catch fire, it does indicate that the tree is more resistant to catching fire.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHankJohnson/photos/a.318785022005.143821.115356957005/10155181111012006/?type=3",NA,16,3,2,1,0,0,0,0

Although buying the hottest and trendiest toys for your child may be the first thing that crosses your mind, CPSC wants to remind you that safety should always come first.  According to a new report, CPSC estimates that there were 170,400 toy-related, emergency room-treated injuries and seven deaths in 2016 to children younger than 15. All of the riding toy deaths were due to motor vehicular incidents. Most injuries involved lacerations and bruising to the head and face. Please keep these tips in mind when making purchases this season:  Choose toys with care. Keep in mind the child’s age, interests and skill level. Look for quality design and construction in all toys for all ages. For useful tips on holiday toy selection, please watch this video on toy safety, and follow CPSC on Twitter.   Make sure that all directions or instructions are clear—to you, and when appropriate, to the child.   Be a label reader. Look for, and heed, age recommendations (e.g., “Not recommended for children under three”) and other safety labels. Purchase appropriate safety gear with the toy.   If you purchase a hoverboard, make sure it’s compliant with the UL 2272 safety standard. However, even UL 2272 compliance cannot guarantee that the hoverboard will not overheat or catch fire.","status",NA,NA,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0

Keep trimmings with small removable parts out of the reach of children who could swallow or inhale small pieces. Avoid trimmings that resemble candy or food that may tempt a child to reach for and swallow them.  Holiday Lights — Check lights for the mark of an independent safety testing laboratory. Examine new and old lights for broken or cracked sockets, frayed or bare wires, or loose connections. Do not use damaged light sets. Read additional tips on holiday lights.  Candles — Never use lighted candles on a tree or near other evergreens. Always use non-flammable holders. Keep candles away from other decorations and wrapping paper. Place candles where they cannot be knocked down or blown over.  Fires — Before lighting any fire, remove all greens, boughs, papers, and other decorations from fireplace area. Check to see that flue is open. Keep a screen in front of the fireplace whenever a fire is burning . Ensure your chimney is inspected annually.","link","https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2018/Put-Safety-at-the-Top-of-Your-List-When-Decorating-this-Holiday-Season","cpsc.gov",6,5,1,0,0,0,0,0
