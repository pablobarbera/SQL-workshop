These U.S. citizens need the immediate help of the federal government and deserve the same support that hurricane-affected states receive. I have joined my colleagues to send three letters so far demanding the Federal Government send immediate help to Puerto Rico. I joined my colleagues in the House & Senate to ask for simple changes that will speed the delivery of supplies and resources that the Island needs, pushed for the same disaster-relief treatment for U.S. territories that states receive, and called on the administration to urgently scale up military resources & aid for Puerto Rico & the Virgin Islands. Our service members can help if allowed and they are needed in increased numbers for security, medical, infrastructure repairs, and to restore stability in the region.","status",NA,NA,60,18,5,2,0,0,11,2
