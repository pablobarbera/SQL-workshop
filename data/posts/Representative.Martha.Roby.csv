This Sunday at 5:30p.m., Alabama Public Television will air its new eduational documentary project ""Inside Congress: Alabama to DC.""   About a year ago, Roy Clem, the Exectuive Director of Alabama Public Television, reached out to my office about documenting the daily work life of a Unites States Congressman. I thought it was an interesting idea, and so we opened up our office to filmmaker Mark Fastoso and his talented team. Mark is known for his most recent work, ‚ÄúJEREMIAH,‚Äù the documentary profile of former U.S. Senator Jeremiah Denton who famously blinked T-O-R-T-U-R-E as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He won four Emmy Awards and the Edward R. Murrow Award for the film.   With the start of a new Congress and new presidential administration about to take office, there is a lot of interest in government right now. It‚Äôs really the perfect time to offer this inside look into what happens in Congress.   Having a camera crew follow your every move (even in the car and to the grocery store) is an interesting experience to say the least. But so much goes on in our day-to-day that most never get to see, so I hope this film offers students and adults alike a glimpse into our sometimes chaotic world. I'm also pleased that the film captures the hard work of my staff, who do so much to help constituents in need.

It was called by some President Obama's ""parting gift to Planned Parenthood"": an eleventh hour HHS regulation that threatens to take away Title X public health funding from any state that chooses to direct those dollars to clinics that do not perform abortions. You read that correctly. If a state, like Alabama, rightfully chooses to make sure its pass-through public health dollars are directed toward health clinics that do not perform abortions, it would be in violation of this rule and liable to get its federal funds taken away.   I've long been outspoken about the need to stop taxpayer funding from going to prop up abortion clinics. Our legislation to do that was vetoed by President Obama. That didn't stop some states from taking action to make sure the Title X funds they receive go to true health centers and not abortion clinics - which they have every right to do. But, thanks to the abortion industry's fierce allies in the Obama Administration, this regulation was put in place to quash those state efforts.   Tomorrow, the House will consider a bill to utilize our authority under the Congressional Review Act to officially ""disapprove"" this rule and strike it altogether. I proudly support this measure, and look forward to joining the debate. I'll be making two important points: first, the federal government has no business telling states they can't enact reasonable rules on how they spend federal health dollars. Second, there is no place in the budget of the United States for the funding of abortion clinics, and this is just one of many steps that need to be taken to stop the pipeline of federal funding for nation's largest abortion business.","link","http://www.christianpost.com/news/obama-gift-planned-parenthood-rescinded-congress-175067/","christianpost.com",46,27,6,4,0,2,0,1

There has been a culture problem for some time, and the VA Secretary has long needed authority to swiftly fire those who are mistreating veterans or who can‚Äôt get the job done.

For 40 years, Protection and Advocacy agencies in Alabama and around the country have provided a critical service by monitoring the quality of care in state-operated hospitals, clinics, psychiatric wards, prisons, and other facilities. I believe bringing this high degree of expertise in patient advocacy to the VA would greatly benefit veterans, particularly those in need of mental health care or substance abuse treatment.   Though we have made progress in improving the VA, much work remains. The VA has focused more attention on making sure veterans seeking mental health care treatment are seen right away.

As you know, I've been a part of several Congressional Delegations to the region to survey our progress there and inform our efforts in Congress to fund and support the military.   Having observed the situation over several years now, I can tell you that our progress is as fragile as ever. That's why I am pleased that President Trump and Secretary Mattis are reviewing our strategy in Afghanistan, including our troop levels and rules of engagement. I'm also pleased that the House, Senate, and White House were able to deliver a comprehensive appropriations bill that fully funds our military. one of the reaons I was eager to serve on Defense Approppriations was having the opportunity to reverse miltary cuts that make no sense.   We cannot tie the hands of our military when sending them into harm's way. Please take a moment to watch my remarks, or read them below.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a report on my recent travels to Afghanistan where our Armed Forces remain engaged at a critical front of the Global War on Terrorism.   I have been a part of several Congressional Delegations to Afghanistan to survey conditions there, particularly as it concerns the progress being made by Afghan women and girls to attain equal rights.   I was honored to once again lead a delegation of my colleagues to the region to conduct oversight of American operations and better inform our efforts here in Congress to fulfill our Constitutional responsibility to fund and support the military.   Mr. Speaker, it has been more than fifteen years since American and allied forces invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban regime and stamp out the terrorist breeding ground it harbored. Many brave Americans have given their lives in the struggle to defeat the al-Qaeda terrorist threat and protect our homeland. It is incumbent on us as a nation to honor their sacrifice by never allowing it to be in vain.   So much has been given, and because of that, so much has been gained.  There is no question in my mind that our country is safer and the world is freer because of the work our military has done and continues to do in Afghanistan. That‚Äôs an important truth I‚Äôm reminded of in a powerful way each time I visit, and I am compelled to share it with my colleagues here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I‚Äôve said for years that the canary in the coalmine for our success in Afghanistan going forward is the preservation of the gains made by women and girls. Having observed the treatment of women and girls over many years now, I can tell you that the progress today is as fragile as ever.   There is good news. New laws criminalize violence toward women and offer them unprecedented legal protections. Girls are attending school and going to college. Women are working in government, serving in the military, and even running for office. There is an Afghanistan Women‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce that specifically works to see that women are incorporated in the nation‚Äôs economic future.   For American women like me who grew up with parents telling me I could achieve anything I wanted to, those kind of things are commonplace. For Afghan women who grew up in a culture that has subjugated them to second class citizenship, or worse, these activities are nothing short of extraordinary. Centuries of repression are being reversed, and a new generation of women that expects and demands basic rights is taking hold.   During our visit, our delegation was honored to meet with Afghan First Lady Rula Ghani and many other women leaders. We discussed the opportunities now available to Afghan women that weren‚Äôt conceivable fifteen years ago under the Taliban. And, most importantly, they explained just how critical these gains are to the overall stability of Afghanistan.   While it is certainly encouraging to listen to these remarkable stories of hope and progress, there exists a deep concern among Afghan women about seeing these important gains backslide and their rights erode. In fact, in some areas of the country, this is already happening. The Taliban‚Äôs resurgence amid the drawdown of coalition forces presents a major threat that we must acknowledge.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this to happen. We cannot allow the gains we‚Äôve made in Afghanistan to fall by the wayside.   We know all too well what can happen when radical, oppressive ideologies are allowed to fester in hostile nations. Make no mistake: because freedom and fairness for Afghan women is essential to the security of their country, it is also crucial to our own.   That‚Äôs why I am pleased that President Trump is reviewing our strategy in Afghanistan, including a reevaluation of troop levels and our rules of engagement.   Simply put, if we‚Äôre going to be in Afghanistan, we need to be willing to do what it takes to succeed. Of course, the Afghan people must take the reins of their country‚Äôs future, but the United States will play a key role in ensuring a lasting peace.   Right now I fear we have tied the hands of our military through reduced force strength and limited rules of engagement. We should never send our military men and women into harm‚Äôs way without the tools and resources they need to get the job done. Reevaluating our force strength and rules of engagement is the right decision, and I look forward to hearing from President Trump and Secretary Mattis as the NATO summit approaches.   Mr. Speaker, I‚Äôm also pleased that Congress was able to deliver a comprehensive appropriations bill that properly funds our military. Funding the government by short term extensions takes away the Pentagon‚Äôs ability to plan for the future. With everything going on in the world right now, including the situation in Afghanistan, we cannot hinder our commanders with financial uncertainties.  One of the reasons I was so eager to serve on Defense Appropriations was having the opportunity to reverse military cuts that made no sense. For the last several years we have been in constant tension with the Obama Administration whose sequestration policy threatened to hollow out our military. But not anymore.  I appreciate my colleagues in the House and Senate coming together to ensure proper military funding this year, and I am particularly grateful for the full support of President Trump on our comprehensive appropriations bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district that is home to both Fort Rucker and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, two installations that play key roles in ensuring our national security.   The Montgomery-based 908th Airlift Wing and 187th Fighter Wing have each made multiple deployments in support of our mission in Afghanistan. And of course, Army aviators trained at Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass have been an essential component of the modern battlefield.   Alabamians are proud of our state‚Äôs contributions to the military, and I am proud to advocate on behalf of the thousands of service families, veterans, and retirees I represent.    Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues who joined me on this bi-partisan Congressional Delegation to Afghanistan: Congresswomen Susan Davis, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Susan Brooks, and Val Demings. I appreciate your partnership in demonstrating that the United States is committed to building on the progress made in Afghanistan.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/videos/1757502040942831/",NA,26,14,1,2,2,0,0,2

It is time to send a clear message: If you kill a law enforcement officer, you will be brought to justice and punished to the full extent of the law.   Law enforcement offers need more than equipment and funding ‚Äì they need our support. They need our support because they are under attack.  The last few years have seen a disturbing uptick in the instances of police being targeted by violent criminals just because they are wearing a badge. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, at least 64 police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty last year, 21 one of which were ambush-style killings. Attacks in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Chicago, and other places were chilling reminders of the dangers these brave individuals face when they go to work.   Under current federal law, killing a federal law enforcement officer is an aggravating factor when considering a death sentence for the offender ‚Äì just as it should be.    However, that same deterrent and protection is not extended to state or local police officers, firefighters, or first responders. The Thin Blue Line Act would change this by making the murder of local law enforcement an aggravating factor when considering a death sentence.","video","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/videos/1757712317588470/",NA,48,16,9,2,0,0,0,5

This center is operated by the U.S. Secret Service and trains state and local law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges from all over the nation in handling digital evidence. It has trained more than 6,250 local officials from all 50 states and three U.S. Territories.  -H.R. 1892, the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act; authorizes the governors of a state or territory to proclaim that the United States flag shall be flown at half-staff in the event that a public safety officer dies while serving in the line of duty.   -H.R. 1039, the Probation Officer Protection Act of 2017; authorizes a probation officer to arrest a person, without warrant, if there is probable cause to believe the person forcibly assaulted or obstructed a probation officer while performing their official duties.

Sanctuary cities are magnets for illegal immigrants, including some dangerous people with criminal records.

This puts Americans at risk, and I believe the federal government should do all it can to discourage it.

Amid all the fun and relaxation that can come with a holiday weekend, I hope you and your family will take time to remember the meaning of Memorial Day and to honor the brave Americans who died so that we may be free.   At today's Memorial Day observances at Arlington National Cemetery, General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered meaningful remarks about that sacrifice and what we can do to honor it from a Marine's perspective. Please take a moment to read what he said and share it with friends and family around you. There's also a video clip you can watch: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBYDqdgu8w   General Dunford:  ""Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Secretary Mattis and, most importantly, Gold Star Families, it is an honor to join you this morning in remembrance and reflection. Since the founding of our republic, more than 42 million Americans have stepped forward to serve their country in uniform. Their story is one of selflessness, it's one of courage, and it's one of sheer commitment. But their story is also one of extraordinary sacrifice. More than one million Americans who have answered the last full measure of their devotion so their fellow citizens could live in freedom and raise their children in peace.   ""Today we honor the fallen from battlefields that served as weigh points in our history: from Saratoga to Gettysburg, And Bellau Wood to Midway, from Chosin to la Drang, and from Korengal Valley to Fallujah, today we reflect on the enormity of the sacrifice. We reflect on the hopes and the dreams never realized.   ""Today we also reflect on the sacrifice of the families left behind: the anguish of parents, spouses, siblings and friends; the sadness of children growing up without their fathers or mothers. And we know that for the families, every day is memorial day.   ""But today we also reflect on what's most important about the men and women we honor. We reflect on how they lived. They were people who stood for something larger than themselves. They were people who embodied the most important values and tradition traditions of our nation. They were people that understood that what we have in our country is worth fighting for. And though they were taken from us prematurely, they were people that touched our lives, they were people who made a difference.   ""Today if we truly want to honor the fallen from all our conflicts, we'll do something more than mark their graves with flags and flowers. We'll do something more than delivering remarks and reflect for just a few moments. If we truly want to give meaning to the sacrifice of those who have given all on our behalf, each of us will leave here today determined to find in some small way a method of serving our nation in our communities in their honor. If we do that, then I would offer that those of us who were taken from us prematurely will be able to look down and know that we truly do remember them.   ""Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of soldiers, sailors, airmen and coast guardsmen still in uniform, thank you for remembering.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/photos/a.190126367680414.55150.174519582574426/1769226706437031/?type=3",NA,23,3,2,1,0,0,0,0

For far too long there has been a culture of complacency at the VA, and our own Central Alabama VA became a prime example of poor performance, negligence, and even abuse. These new accountability standards and whistleblower protections will lead to better care for veterans. I appreciate the commitment President Trump and Secretary Shulkin have shown to work with Congress to enact long overdue changes at the VA.","video","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/videos/1798671116825923/",NA,105,27,20,11,1,0,2,2

Our proposal would significantly increase the Child Tax Credit and make it applicable to payroll taxes so more low and middle income Americans can take advantage of it.   For a lot of people I represent, this can make a big difference. For that mom working a retail job or the dad driving the truck or the parent working two or three jobs so the other can stay home ‚Äì having an extra couple thousand dollars in your pocket is a big deal.   Alabamians are proud to work for a living and provide for their families. What we can do is make life work just a little easier by allowing taxpayers to keep more of what they earn. I promise you parents know how to spend that money better than the government does.   I‚Äôd like to personally thank Ivanka for her support of this proposal, and more generally for her focus on helping working families in this country. As I said today, the House is ready.

I spoke out during the floor debate urging my colleagues to pass this bill. Proud to support and defend the 2nd Amendment while making sure our criminal background check system works the way it should. Thank you to the NRA - National Rifle Association of America and other groups who have helped build support for this commonsense bill and dispel myths about what it does. I hope the Senate will take it up without delay.  FULL SPEECH:  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.  Our Founders laid out certain rights in our Constitution ‚Äì not to empower the government, but to empower the people.   Certainly, among the most fundamental rights we have as Americans is the right to keep and bear arms.  H.R. 38 ‚Äì the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 - simply ensures all law-abiding citizens who meet the requirements to obtain concealed carry permits in their home states can enjoy exercise the right to protect themselves in any state provided that they obey local concealed carry laws.   Mr. Speaker, some opponents of this bill claim that we are somehow making it easier for dangerous, unqualified individuals to obtain and carry guns. That is absolutely not true. If a citizen is currently prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm, this bill does nothing to change that.   On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, others will tell you that we are making it harder for law-abiding Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights. That‚Äôs not true either. H.R. 38 does nothing to infringe upon anyone‚Äôs right to keep and bear arms. The bill simply seeks to ensure that our current National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is enforced and working properly.  Those of us who respect the Second Amendment and dedicate our careers to defending it will always fight to protect this fundamental right from those who would erode it. But, Mr. Speaker, we also have a responsibility to uphold and enforce our current laws to ensure dangerous people can‚Äôt obtain weapons.   In fact, it is precisely because we want to preserve our Second Amendment rights that we must ensure our criminal background check system works properly.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill in order to ensure that those who obtain a concealed carry permit in one state are able to enjoy this freedom in any state and to make sure our current background check system is working the way it was intended to work.  Thank you. I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/videos/1979342862092080/",NA,210,64,50,29,3,0,4,22

I applaud the Department of Justice for opening an investigation into the appalling practice of harvesting and trafficking aborted babies' body parts. As you may remember, in 2015 top Planned Parenthood officials were caught on camera discussing systematically altering abortion procedures in order to preserve certain organs so they could sell them to researchers. That's against the law. Yet, the Obama-Lynch Justice Department looked the other way and declined to pursue an investigation. I said at the time it was disappointing, but hardly surprising.   Now, the Trump-Sessions Justice Department appears to be following up on the clear evidence and taking Congressional referrals for an investigation seriously. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Assistant Attorney General (and my former chief of staff) Stephen Boyd requested unreacted documents from the committee's investigation into Planned Parenthood. He said the documents are for investigative use only at this point, and a resolution may be required for further proceedings, such as a grand jury.   On July 14, 2015, when the undercover videos first surfaced, I immediately went to the House floor to speak out and raise awareness (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQxXkK8VTfc).

Today, Congress is sending our historic tax reform plan to the President‚Äôs desk.   This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce the tax burden on American families and grow our economy ‚Äì and I‚Äôm glad we could deliver.   Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a typical, median income American family will get a tax cut of about $2,100. And that‚Äôs not just one year, but annually.   For moms and dads working to make ends meet, an extra couple thousand dollars in the budget can make a big difference. It‚Äôs their money to begin with, and I believe families know how to spend it better than the government does.   Another important aspect of our tax reform plan is lowering business taxes. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize that our effective tax rate for businesses is among the highest in the world. All that does is send jobs overseas and make it harder for small businesses to be successful. By lowering business taxes to a globally-competitive 21 percent, we can boost our economy and spur job growth here in the United States.   Our legislation also preserves a lot of the popular tax deductions people count on, including the student loan interest deduction, the deduction for teachers‚Äô expenses, the medical expense deduction, and the mortgage interest deduction. It doubles the Child Tax Credit to help working families and eliminates the Obamacare individual mandate tax penalty.   A misinformation campaign from the other side had generated a lot of confusion about this bill ‚Äì what it actually does and doesn‚Äôt do. But, I believe the results will speak for themselves. Americans will know who was telling the truth when they see more money in their pockets and a growing economy thanks to our historic tax reform plan.","video","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/videos/1993851570641209/",NA,177,144,25,19,6,0,6,58

As 2017 comes to a close, we have a lot to be excited about!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/photos/a.190126367680414.55150.174519582574426/1996499607043072/?type=3",NA,164,16,2,18,0,0,0,4

We have taken action on almost every major Republican agenda item and ended the year with overhauling our nation's broken tax code - a big victory for the American people.   Our work is far from complete and many of our conservative, common sense bills are stuck in the Senate. In 2018, we'll remain focused on keeping our promises and delivering results.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Representative.Martha.Roby/photos/a.190126367680414.55150.174519582574426/2003499823009717/?type=3",NA,53,57,8,3,4,1,3,7
