I am also concerned about his role on the NSC and his overall role in the White House. A man that has connections to the KKK and former chief of Breitbart news, which is the definition of fake news in my opinion, should not have the ear of the President.  The purpose of the NSC is to serve as the President’s main resource for determining issues of national security and foreign policy. Both Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn have made my colleagues and I nervous with their ties to Russia and their support for Putin. Especially learning Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with the country’s ambassador to the United States a month before President Trump took office. Therefore, they should not be sitting on the NSC and that is why I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 804, introduced by Representative Stephanie Murphy (D-FL). This legislation bares the president from appointing aides who are political in nature to serve as a member of the NSC.   President Trump should not have political figure heads from his administration on the NSC. There are men and women abroad who risk their lives every day for us and to have a man that is political in nature on the Council that inherently makes decisions about their safety is horrifying.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/us/politics/national-security-council-turmoil.html","nytimes.com",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

During my tour I spoke to a gentleman named, Jim, from Delaware. During our conversation Jim spoke about his 26-year-old daughter, who is a small business owner in NYC who relies on the Affordable Care Act. He informed me that if his daughter did not have the Affordable Care Act that she would not have the opportunity to run her small business.  The more I spoke to Jim; I asked him what he thinks those in Congress can do to better understand one another—especially representing the American people better.  He said plainly, “What you are doing today. Talking to people…[that] there are real human beings involved.” Also, “I [Jim] would wish that people on either side of the aisle would remember that there are real people involved in all these issues.” “There are real people involved at the end of everything that is talked about in Congress, either side of the aisle. Remember there are people at the end of all of this.”  The chat I had with Jim are what representatives should have with their constituents. Attentively listening to one another and understanding the core of every individual we come across.  After our talk and talking to some of my constituents over the weekend in Philadelphia, I felt the hesitation and apprehension about the possibility of government coming together as one. I want to tell everyone that I am working on your behalf, I will not put us in a position that will harm us! If Republicans and Democrats can come together on some issues, that's great.

John Lewis and the protestors were met with state troopers and troopers on horseback and were attacked. Two days after “Bloody Sunday,” King led a group of 2,000 protestors, including clergy; and they walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, prayed and marched back to Selma, Alabama. Shortly thereafter, President Lyndon Baines Johnson would introduce voting rights legislation. On August 6, 1965, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Without the Voting Rights Act of 1965, African Americans and other minorities would be barred from voting and continue to have limited civil rights.   Just like those many years ago, today during these incredibly divisive times we are being called upon  to speak out against intolerance and speak up for what is right.","status",NA,NA,10,0,2,1,0,0,0,0

During the meeting Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond, Assistant Democratic Leader James E. Clyburn and the CBC Executive Committee delivered a CBC-authored, 130-page policy document titled, “We Have A Lot To Lose: Solutions to Advance Black Families in the 21st Century” which includes detailed African-American history, CBC history, 21st century policy solutions for African-American families, and also highlights, Middle Neighborhoods, School Rehabilitation and Food Insecurity as main priorities for the #CBC policy agenda and solutions.  Since the day I arrived in Congress on November 14, 2016, I knew I had to enact a strategy that would create an agenda that prioritizes America’s Middle Neighborhoods. Today, I am proud to say that the first step of our process has been put into action. Members of our Executive Committee have made it clear to the President that in order to help America’s Middle Neighborhoods, neighborhoods on the verge of growth and decline, we need to act and tackle issues such as food insecurity and increased investments in school rehabilitation and infrastructure.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDwightEvans/photos/a.367457043636878.1073741828.364081370641112/388513251531257/?type=3",NA,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Under the #ACA, insurance companies are required to offer coverage to all Americans and cover 10 “essential health benefits”. Those essential #health benefits are:   Maternity care Prescription drugs Mental health services Emergency services Outpatient care Inpatient care Hospitalization Rehabilitative services  Preventative & Wellness services Pediatric services  If they introduce another health plan that takes healthcare away from millions of Americans, my colleagues and I will once again #resist a plan that does not provide quality care for our most vulnerable. We should look for ways to improve the #ACA not #RepealAndReplace a law that works.","link","https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-04/trump-white-house-pushes-new-gop-health-bill-deal-lawmakers-say","bloomberg.com",10,2,4,0,0,0,0,0

We are less than 120 days into the new administration and the President has already enacted the Global Gag Rule, which cuts 10 billion dollars from International NGOs, simply because they offer abortion services or provide referrals to a clinic that can perform an abortion. By cutting off funding to International NGOs, clinics lose money that they could use towards maternal health care, HIV prevention and treatment, and birth control to name a few.    Just last week Vice President Pence cast the deciding vote on Title X funding, that strips federal dollars from health clinics, such as #PlannedParenthood.   One of the Administration’s latest actions strips funding from the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA), which works with families on reproductive health, family planning, HIV/AIDS, and infant & maternal mortality in more than 150 countries—due to the recent action by the President the United States will no longer be funding this important and imperative program. The Administration’s attacks on a women’s right to choose will not be forgotten by the American people and the international community.    I will not stay silent in the face of an administration that prevents women from making decisions that are in the best interest of themselves and their families.","link","http://www.vox.com/world/2017/4/4/15177964/unfpa-abortion-defunding-trump-un-women-children","vox.com",16,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

This week’s horrendous attack was yet another atrocity in the Assad regime’s string of deadly attacks on the Syrian people.  Last night President Trump took unilateral action to use U.S. military force without the input of Congress. Congress needs to be a part of the conversation and more importantly a part of implementing a long term strategy in Syria.  History teaches us that the consequences of military action without a clear plan are catastrophic. As the voice of the American people, Congress has an obligation to take a vote to determine what the role and level of U.S. involvement in Syria should be moving forward.  As we reflect on the actions that took place last night, we are reminded that this week marked the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, exactly a year to the day after he delivered his infamous, antiwar Beyond Vietnam speech.

During their visit they explained how their customers often have to choose between medicine and food. They also talked about how President Trump’s budget cuts will not only affect them, but primarily hurt the customers they serve.  In #Philadelphia, 1 in 4 people are food insecure and 30 percent of them are children. Those who are food insecure lack access to adequate food and do not know where their next meal will come from.  What upsets me greatly is how older citizens have worked all their lives to uplift our nation in various fields, yet they oftentimes are struggling to feed themselves. No person in American should be worried where their next meal comes from!  If Republicans continue to vouch for President Trump’s budget, they are aligning themselves with a President who is in favor of cutting SNAP, Meals on Wheels, and after-school programs—to name a few.

I am pleased that as a Congress we were able to fulfill our Constitutional duty and pass a common-sense spending bill that will ensure that Philadelphians, Pennsylvanians and all Americans nationwide will not have to worry about their government doing our job.  I am also very happy to share that the spending bill does not include funding for the President’s border wall but instead includes appropriate funding for the McGovern-Dold Food for Education Programs and the Special Supplemental Nutrition for Woman, Infants and Children (WIC). The bill also provides a two billion dollar increase from last year to fund the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which you know makes me happy as #PA02 is home to many of our nation’s leading research institutions!   Although there are what I would count as small victories in this spending bill as I shared with you last week, our federal workers who help secure our nation’s borders, protect and monitor our food supply, and support businesses through agencies like the United States Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and the Small Business Administration deserve better and should not have to wait while a Republican Congress tries to figure out how to use the manual transmission which drives our economy.

Yesterday, I visited DaVita Dialysis Center as a part of my #PA02 hospital tour. I want to tell you a story about my friend, Ms. Jones.   Ms. Jones has been on dialysis for the last two years and receives her weekly care from DaVita. She comes in for treatment for several hours a day, three to four times a week to get her dialysis. Even though Ms. Jones is in a tough situation, she has an incredible spirit and shared with me how if she didn’t have help from the state and wasn’t benefiting from the #ACA she wouldn’t be able to get the care she needs. Ms. Jones worked hard for many years and earned a livable wage but now lives on a fixed income and needs help to pay for her medicine.   When we think about how the health care debate in Congress impacts the quality of life for Philadelphians we are talking about people like Ms. Jones. We know health care is a matter of access. If you don’t have the financial means you don’t have access to quality care. Ms. Jones’ story is like so many of our stories.

The museum’s Founding Director, Lonnie Bunch, said it “is a painful reminder of the challenges that African Americans continue to face and the noose has long represented a deplorable act of cowardice and depravity—a symbol of extreme violence for African Americans.”  This is the second time in less than a week that a noose has been found on Smithsonian grounds and it highlights that hate and intolerance are sadly still prevalent in 2017.

If the President rolls back the birth control mandate over 55 million women will be affected nationwide. His actions would force our mothers, sisters and daughters to pay OUT-OF-POCKET for birth control, if their employer does not allow them to use birth control due to religious beliefs.  I believe an employer’s religious beliefs SHOULD NOT dictate whether a woman has to pay-out-pocket for medication that she feels is in the best interest of the health and safety of herself and her family.

Together, we will fight back against and overcome the intolerance and hate in our communities.","link","http://www.upworthy.com/philadelphia-added-2-new-stripes-to-the-pride-flag-heres-what-they-stand-for","upworthy.com",41,1,7,7,0,0,0,0

While in Israel I spoke with policy makers, elected officials, and residents to hear their stories and learn more about their experiences. For me it’s always all about people. Talking to people is the only way to learn about their needs and figure out solutions.    We visited the vibrant and culturally diverse city of Tel Aviv, toured historic sites like Jerusalem’s Old City, took a trip to the Iron Dome to see firsthand what’s at stake when it comes to safety and security in the region, had a meeting at the Knesset, and visited many more memorable sites.   You may know that I talk a lot about the strength of our neighborhoods and making our neighborhoods nationwide that much stronger. I was so impressed by the sense of pride everyone had in their neighborhoods in Israel. I loved seeing that as pride in our neighborhoods is a theme near and dear to me!   After our time in Israel some members of our delegation went on to Jordan. While we were in Jordan I visited the Zaatari Refugee Camp, the largest refugee camp in Jordan. There are more than 80,000 refugees from Syria at the Zaatari Camp. A lot of our conversations were focused on global poverty and laying out  strategies to help those most in need. As you know, helping people overcome poverty both in our country and around our globe is an issue I am deeply committed to.   I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be a part of this very beneficial and valuable trip.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDwightEvans/photos/a.367457043636878.1073741828.364081370641112/447953042253944/?type=3",NA,30,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

These events did however catalyze a national conversation around Confederate symbols in our country.   Confederate symbols, such as the battle flag and monuments, were built between the late 19th century and early 20th century, during the Jim Crow Era. They weren’t created to “honor” anyone’s heritage, but instead were constructed to terrorize African-Americans and remind people in the South that if the Civil War had not ended as it did, slavery would still exist today.  American history includes African-Americans—our suffering and our survival. The 1,503 symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces, must go!

The March on Washington in the summer of 1963 was a pivotal moment in our history as it raised the economic, social, and political injustice African-Americans continued to face.   The March on Washington created a dialogue across the country around desegregating schools, the right to vote, and creating comprehensive civil rights legislation.  We must never forget the impact this march had on not only the African-American community but to our country as a whole. Today as interfaith leaders marched together as one we remember we are a country united when we stand together as one and speak up for what is just, equitable and fair.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDwightEvans/photos/a.367457043636878.1073741828.364081370641112/470540063328575/?type=3",NA,20,1,6,4,0,0,1,0

But as we know, the wrath of Hurricane #Irma has left many in an incredibly challenging situation.   People from the Virgin Islands, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, and St, John have been assessing the damage of the Hurricane Irma the past few days and many are left picking up the pieces of their homes, valuables, and lives. With this, many Floridians are determining what’s left of their homes, while government officials across the state assess the structural damage.  While we shift our focus on the recovery efforts for #Florida and the Caribbean islands that were hit by Hurricane Irma, we must understand the importance of economic development in states across the country and why there is a need for an increase in federal dollars.  I proudly voted in favor of the $15.25 billion hurricane relief and debt-limit package because as Americans we must come together in a time of need and help out our fellow brothers & sisters.   When, not if, we are hit with a category 5 hurricane or met with an earthquake similar to one that struck Mexico--America must be prepared. One way to prepare for weather-related disasters is paying attention to our infrastructure plans, which includes the need for more money for infrastructure.   Infrastructure is bridges, roads, airports, water treatment facilities, streetscapes, and so much more. If we want to be sure that buildings are up to code and can withstand hurricane-forced winds, our water is clean, and every family in America has access to broadband then both Democrats and Republicans must focus on infrastructure during the recovery efforts of Hurricane Irma.   Hurricane Irma is an example of why we as a nation need to pay attention to not only our infrastructure plans, but #climate change and its impact globally.","link","http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/10/549981547/the-rubble-and-recovery-of-u-s-virgin-islands-will-we-survive-the-aftermath","npr.org",15,1,6,0,0,0,0,0

Seems like the Senator has quickly changed his views on that!   In case you missed it here is what he said:   “No family should be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can’t afford it.”  Well it turns out that Senator Cassidy’s (R-LA) own healthcare bill, #GrahamCassidy, would in fact raise premiums for Americans who have pre-existing conditions. Which includes, pregnancy, asthma, various forms of cancer, autism, heart failure, depression, and so much more.   It seems that Senator Cassidy and Republicans who support this slightly modified version of #TrumpCare have not learned that the American people want to keep their healthcare and are so afraid even about the thought of losing their healthcare coverage simply because of partisan politics.

This landmark legislation modernized the food stamp program, which we have come to call the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).   Many of our senior, working families, and college students lack the financial means necessary to put food on the kitchen table. SNAP is a remarkable and important federal program that communities across the country rely on for stability and survival.    As we celebrate SNAP’s 40th year anniversary, I will continue to fight on behalf of #PA02, the hard-working Americans who utilize this important federal program to feed their loved ones. And I’ll continue to work across party lines to fight for #SNAP, because every American should have access to healthy, nutritious food and not have to worry about where their next meal will come from.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/29/oh-snap-its-been-40-years-since-the-food-stamps-act/?utm_term=.7bd117af5f43","washingtonpost.com",20,1,3,0,0,1,0,0

Therefore, he organized what we think to be 400 ministers to boycott companies who did not believe in equal opportunity employment. His slogan, “Don’t buy where you don’t work” was extremely successful and led to similar boycotts around the country. His actions provided over 5,000 jobs in #Philadelphia, #Pennsylvania.   While the boycott was successful, Rev. Leon H. Sullivan realized that some African-Americans were not trained and prepared for their new jobs. To make sure they would have the skills necessary to keep and retain these jobs, he founded the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America.   His dedication to communities of color and creating an organization that help people obtain the skills needed to succeed, is still an incredible model for cities across our country!   Heroes, like Rev. Leon H. Sullivan did not get enough recognition for the ground work they helped lay for people like me, who want to help build stronger neighborhoods block by block. That is why, I am so proud to share that this week a state historical marker was placed in North Philadelphia to honor Rev. Sullivan and his impact on our neighborhoods!    It was wonderful to attend the ceremony with leaders in our City who understand the importance of Rev. Sullivan’s work and celebrate his accomplishments that continue to inspire generations to create positive change in America in the face of adversity.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDwightEvans/photos/a.367939856921930.1073741829.364081370641112/491662591216322/?type=3",NA,33,6,5,9,0,0,0,0

According to researchers at The Reinvestment Fund in Philadelphia, approximately 48 percent of city residents, across the country, live in “middle neighborhoods,” which are described as stable, working-class communities that generally lack outside investment.   Middle neighborhoods typically are affordable, safe, and functional. In Philadelphia’s middle neighborhoods, schools are generally good, crime is relatively low, and housing is stable, but danger of decline lingers. Middle neighborhoods are incredibly viable and valuable to our city.  They provide a considerable portion of our city’s property tax revenue, yet we often do not give them the credit, attention, and support they deserve.

This critical health program provides 9 million children nationwide with health insurance. In the coming months federal dollars to fund the program will run out, which means children in our neighborhoods nationwide will no longer have a healthcare plan that serves all their medical needs.   Republicans inability to pass CHIP further highlights their lack of consideration for the #healthcare needs of our youngest & brightest minds!  I won’t stop speaking out for the 9 MILLION children nationwide in need and encourage you, your family, and friends to press Republicans as to why #CHIP has yet to be renewed—this inaction simply cannot continue!","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/opinion/governors-children-healthcare-congress.html","nytimes.com",15,1,3,1,0,0,0,0

Since then, no meaningful gun legislation has been passed in Congress, in spite of the widespread public support for common-sense gun reform. According to the CDC, on average, 93 Americans are killed with guns every day in our country and our nation has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate among the world’s most developed nations.   In October 2017, there were over 232 homicides in #Philadelphia, meaning the homicide rate was 8 percent higher than it was during the same time last year according to date from the Philadelphia Police Department.  As your Member of Congress and a proud Philadelphian, I am tired of the excuses and inactions from this Congress when it comes to common-sense gun legislation!
