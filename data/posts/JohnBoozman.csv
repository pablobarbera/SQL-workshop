I am looking forward to working with the capable leaders at the Departments of State and Homeland Security to craft and implement policies that ensure that we are maintaining the highest level of security. For more, see the statement below:   ""Protecting our national security must be a top priority. Our intelligence community and citizens in communities across Arkansas and the United States lack confidence in the programs we use to vet refugees fleeing from persecution and war-torn countries like Syria. We need reasonable measures that allow us to evaluate safety checks for people coming into our country.

She brought with her nearly two decades of nursing experience to the nurse corps, serving with the 148th Evacuation Hospital. Sears became active in National Guard Association of Arkansas as a member of the Board of Directors. In various leadership roles, she helped grow the association into what it is today, while breaking through the glass ceiling. She was the very first female in any National Guard Association or any of its territories to become President of a National Guard Association.

I am pleased that VA has offered strong support of several of the bill’s provisions. I am particularly grateful for VA’s support of the bill’s efforts to create a pilot program for peer-to-peer assistance for women veterans and to expand support programs for female veterans who are homeless.  But while VA has indicated support for a large majority of what the bill sets out to accomplish, it has expressed reservations about two provisions in particular—one that requires at least one full time or part time women’s health primary care provider in each facility and a second provision that aims to improve data collection on the health care needs of female veterans.  I stressed the importance of achieving these goals to the first panel’s lead witness, Dr. Jennifer S. Lee, the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services at VA.

I commend President Trump for taking the appropriate steps to make a clean exit from it so we can continue to pursue an “all-of-the-above” approach to meeting our energy needs free of the significant litigation risk created by the agreement.  Typical of Obama-era actions, the agreement picked winners and losers. China, an obvious winner, is allowed to operate without making any significant changes. Meanwhile, the U.S., which was expected to make up 21 percent of all emissions reductions while subsidizing the efforts of other countries, was clearly on the losing side.  It is important to stress that a clean exit from the Paris climate accord will not take away the United States’ seat at the table in future discussions, nor will it detract from our efforts to pursue renewable energy solutions. We need to use everything our nation has been blessed with, including wind, solar, renewable biomass and hydropower to diversify our energy portfolio. Emissions-free nuclear must also play a big role. We will continue to make advancements in these areas and that will not stop once the nation withdraws from this agreement.","status",NA,NA,1130,822,272,98,8,1,28,697

We were fortunate enough to hear from an Arkansan with direct knowledge regarding lack of access to running water in northwest Arkansas.  Mike Frazee testified about his experience living without access to a public water system since moving to Rogers in 1990. In 2014, Mike and his family reached out to my office and we were able to connect him with the Water Systems Council which was able to drill wells that brought fresh, reliable drinking water to him and his neighbors' homes. Mike is now a vocal advocate for upgrading and improving water infrastructure systems and offers his help and advice to other Arkansans facing this type of challenge. Mike said it is his hope that ""through telling the story of my family’s struggle to secure safe, reliable, drinking water that Congress will put in place policies that will bring affordable drinking water to thousands of Arkansans and millions of Americans who live in our nation’s rural areas.""  At the conclusion of his opening statement, Mike shared a portion of this video documenting the Well Water Trust Fund's efforts to ensure that safe, affordable drinking water is accessible which has transformed the lives of his neighbors in Arkansas.

In fact, I recently appeared on an episode of RFD-TV's ""This Week in Agribusiness"" and discussed how I'm communicating this position with the US Trade Representative and the Trump administration.  Now, I've written a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asking the Administration to conduct a robust economic analysis to evaluate how any changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would impact our nation’s crop and livestock sectors. An economic analysis of this type will help us understand the ramifications on the full supply chain of the industries involved.

Boozman said the interviews give families like Roach's something to pass down through generations.  ‘This is important not only for the historical perspective but also for the families,’ he said.”  I appreciate the staff at the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette / ArkansasOnline.com for covering my office’s efforts to promote the Library of Congress Veterans History Project in Arkansas. This really is a special project for me. My dad served in WWII, but I didn’t get to hear about his experience in as much detail as I would have liked. And since he has passed I can’t get that opportunity back.   I’ve learned a lot since we began this effort, but the biggest takeaway is that we should take any and every opportunity to sit down with our veterans and listen to and document their stories. They are amazing, inspiring, full of courage and heroism, heartbreaking, sobering, and each one is unique.  I’m thankful for the folks throughout Arkansas who are getting involved in this effort and I encourage you to join us. It’s an incredibly worthwhile endeavor for many reasons, but mostly because these stories need to be heard by us and by future generations.

This is simply unacceptable. The men and women who have served our nation in uniform were promised that they'd be taken care of by their country in return for their sacrifice. The VA is charged with helping to fulfill that guarantee, especially as it relates to delivering the medical care that veterans need.  I'm troubled by the information that has come to light. The VA must conduct a nationwide review to identify all providers who were known to have had adverse actions taken against their clinical privileges, to include the revocation of state medical licensure, and were subsequently hired by the Department.

That's a record for a president's first year in office, surpassing presidents Kennedy and Nixon, who had 11 federal appeals court nominees confirmed during their first year in office.  This is a really big deal and should not go unnoticed. Federal courts play a large role in our country and the laws that govern it, especially in how laws and statutes are implemented. Judges help shape the direction of the United States for decades. And, since only a very small percentage of cases reach the Supreme Court, it's even more important to appoint and confirm justices who will uphold the constitution at the circuit court-level.  I want to congratulate the president and my colleagues on their diligent and important work to confirm judges appointed by the president over the past year. We have moved at a record pace and the result is that more judges – who serve on the bench for lifetime appointments – committed to upholding the constitution and ruling on the law as Congress intended it to be followed and implemented will now be serving on federal courts.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JohnBoozman/photos/a.380440125735.163066.7686715735/10154971383160736/?type=3",NA,288,262,40,43,6,3,11,143

Most importantly, it's going to help everyday Americans by letting them keep more of their own hard-earned money. CBS This Morning asked three families for their tax returns and found that all three families would receive tax cuts next year because of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.","video","https://www.facebook.com/JohnBoozman/videos/10155879736039360/",NA,561,426,238,43,52,3,6,180

We’re so grateful for their service and sacrifice as they help protect and defend the freedoms we enjoy every day. Wishing all our military, and especially those who are away from home this holiday season, a safe and merry Christmas.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JohnBoozman/photos/a.10151700016425736.1073741826.7686715735/10154996184805736/?type=3",NA,288,62,18,29,0,0,2,12

Our economy is growing. We’ve achieved an unprecedented level of success in confirming qualified, constitutional judges to the bench - including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and 11 nominees to the federal circuit courts of appeal - as well as passing bipartisan reforms to help improve the Department of Veterans Affairs and passing historic tax reform, among other important successes.  Personally, I’ve also experienced some life-changing moments this year from successfully undergoing a major follow-up medical procedure to welcoming a new grandchild into our family. Events like these help me to truly appreciate how precious life is and remember not to take the ones you love for granted.   Now that 2017 is almost over, its time to start looking ahead to what next year will hold and what we can accomplish together. I believe we can and will work with one another to improve the lives of all Americans and create a brighter future for our children and grandchildren. There is no limit to the good things we can do when we come together, determined to make a positive difference in the country we all love and cherish.   I’m looking forward to getting a lot more done in the new year and I hope yours is happy, healthy and full of love and success. May God bless you in 2018.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenateGOP/videos/10155898162179360/",NA,136,152,1,12,30,2,2,69
