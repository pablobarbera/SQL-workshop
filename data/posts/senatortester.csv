They used every incident in my medical record to justify not covering a person who went to the doctor and took care of himself. I could not afford any medical intervention on several conditions that continued to worsen. In 2013 I was involved in a vehicle crash and grossly self-underinsured. I am still paying St Pats the equivalent of a new F250 every month. Nine years after my first denials I was insured through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and managed to catch up on some of my health issues. Among other things my back was too far gone and needed a double fusion. This year I had total knee replacement. I have endured years of pain and could not work.

Four years ago, my wife and I decided to cash in what chips we had saved and start a little organic farm on a piece of land that has been in my family for three generations. Transforming a raw strip of land into a verdant vegetable farm capable of supplying vegetables for a couple hundred families has been the most challenging thing we've ever done, and sufficed to say, things were lean the first few years. Knowing that our children would have health care allowed us to take the kind of risk that our nation is built on. Our growth has been exciting, and we hired two new employees this year.

Dozens of wildfires consumed hundreds of thousands of acres and two firefighters tragically lost their lives. As first responders fought off the flames, I worked to make sure Montanans had the resources they needed to recover from the devastation. And over the past few months, it’s been amazing to see Montanans coming together to rebuild.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatortester/videos/10155673160591665/",NA,194,13,3,21,2,1,1,0

And this year we proved it by sending 11 bipartisan bills to the President’s desk. Yes, legislating is hard these days but together we delivered for Montana.","link","https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=5566","tester.senate.gov",1701,142,64,271,25,4,2,2

And I know thousands of Montanans agree, because when Betsy DeVos was nominated to lead the U.S. Department of Education I heard from just about all of them. That’s why I spent this year holding her feet to the fire to make sure our public schools didn’t lose out on a single opportunity to succeed.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatortester/videos/10154967325676665/",NA,550,68,20,85,11,1,2,2

If that isn’t Washington dysfunction at its worst, I don’t know what is. After calling out this absurdity, telling the success stories of these students, and introducing legislation to hold Secretary Betsy DeVos accountable, we finally got the DOE to reverse its decision and fund the program for the next five years.","link","https://sen.gov/WOPW","sen.gov",563,109,28,48,8,18,6,93

When President Trump first got elected I committed to working with him to “drain the swamp.” Well, here we are almost a year later and my bill hasn’t even been brought up in committee, government agencies have been silenced or censored, and the Administration’s two biggest legislative efforts relied on loopholes to bypass public debate and bipartisan consensus. Regardless, I will keep working to hold our government accountable & I hope more folks join me.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatortester/videos/10155505433926665/",NA,612,57,34,68,6,39,7,10
