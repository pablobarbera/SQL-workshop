Being part of this group gives us the important power to veto any resolution that is not in the interest of our nation or our allies. The Obama Administration recently failed to exercise its veto power on UNSC Resolution 2334, which classifies the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall, Judaism’s holiest site, as “occupied territory,” effectively allowing for Palestinian occupation of these areas.   Since 1972, the U.S. has vetoed 42 anti-Israel resolutions like this one. I strongly oppose the Obama Administration’s abstention – the resolution in question severely undermines the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. If any solution is to be realized, it must come from bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not through the United Nations.   Only weeks before this vote, Russia and China exercised their own respective veto power to strike down a UNSC resolution that would have initiated a seven day ceasefire in Aleppo, Syria in order to allow for humanitarian aid and to resume settlement talks. While Russia and China have made clear that they intend to continue vetoing resolutions that are in conflict with their Syrian allies, the U.S. must make clear that we will stand by our Israeli allies.   The House passed H.Res. 11 this week, which opposes UNSC Resolution 2334 and calls for its repeal. I was proud to vote in favor of this legislation and would urge the incoming Administration to reject resolutions like this one, which obstruct the peace process and are counterproductive to a safe, strong Israel.","status",NA,NA,68,18,12,4,0,1,0,0

Since 2008, nearly 3,300 NEW federal regulations are imposed on job creators and workers every year. It's estimated that these regulations impose a $1.9 trillion burden on consumers and entrepreneurs while raising prices, reducing choice, and making it harder to start businesses (much less, run one!).   At the state level, the real-world impact of regulations vary depending on the unique mix of industries in a given state. Since regulations are designed to target particular sectors of the economy, states like Louisiana that have a concentrated mix of targeted industries will disproportionately feel the impact of those regs.   One study (published by George Mason's Mercatus Center) ranks states by the extent to which regulations impact their economies. Louisiana was on top of that list and found that the impact of federal regulation on Louisiana industries was 74 percent higher than the impact on the nation overall. (Main drivers of this ranking are Louisiana's chemical products manufacturing and oil and gas industries.)   We've made reducing current burdens on our businesses and consumers and preventing future, unnecessary and exorbitant regulatory costs a top priority of our service in Congress, and today marks an important step in a better direction for America.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGarretGraves/videos/680210388825713/",NA,66,14,8,0,0,1,0,0

After Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August of 1990, the United Nations struck back with an embargo and sanctions on Iraq and the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. The U.S.-led coalition of countries began its campaign on January 17, 1991 at approximately 3:00am local time. By February 28 of that year Iraqi troops had retreated and the U.S. declared suspension of the offensive.   This successful campaign reminds us all that the U.S. and its allies remain a global force for good - able to defeat any entity that works against peace in the world.    Before the operation began, President George H.W. Bush commented that he was “convinced not only that we will prevail, but that out of the horror of combat will come the recognition that no nation can stand against a world united. No nation will be permitted to brutally assault its neighbor.” These words continue to resonate with me even 26 years later.   https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/gulf-war","link","https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/gulf-war","history.state.gov",9,2,1,2,0,0,0,0

The project could be completed in approximately two years – and the state has the federal funds available now to build it. Through funds appropriated by Congress, Louisiana has more than $250 million in available flood and disaster prevention funds.  With these Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds, the state just has to prioritize the goals of the Comite project and move forward.     Completing the project would also lower the region’s base flood elevation and eliminates the need for many home and business owners from having to raise their homes, which carries a price tag few can afford.

See the official word from FEMA below, and don't hesitate to contact our office if we can be of assistance.   ###   The Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) requires a policyholder to send the insurer a complete, signed, and sworn proof of loss within 60 days after the date of loss.  Due to the significant, widespread flooding that occurred in portions of Louisiana between August 9, 2016 and August 31, 2016, FEMA issued two Write Your Own (WYO) Bulletins extending the proof of loss deadline:   • WYO Bulletin W-16067 (September 9, 2016) – 60 Day Extension • WYO Bulletin W-16089 (December 2, 2016) – 60 Day Extension   To allow policyholders time to finalize their claims, an additional limited waiver of the 60-day proof of loss requirement has been issued, extending the period an additional 90 days.  With this extension, a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholder will have a total of 270 days after the date of loss to provide the completed, signed, and sworn-to proof of loss to the insurer.  This waiver is issued pursuant to 44 CFR § 61.13(d) and the SFIP.  This waiver does not alter any other terms or conditions of the SFIP.   In order to expedite the recovery process, policyholders are urged to submit a proof of loss as soon as possible.  Policyholders should contact their insurer for assistance with filing a proof of loss.","status",NA,NA,32,3,16,0,0,0,0,0

The WINGMAN Act makes it easier for congressional offices to provide customer service by allowing them to have read-only, direct access to necessary casework documents, removing the bureaucratic middle man from the process.   The HIRE Vets Act creates a self-funded awards program that recognizes the meaningful work of employers to hire and retain veterans.

We discussed some of the most pressing concerns affecting Lebanon and the region - issues that affect us all due to the instability in the Middle East resulting in a refugee crisis.   Dynamics in the Middle East are complicated.  One of the most important components of a Middle East strategy is stabilizing conditions in Syria.  While many focus on where to settle all of these refugees, much of our attention must be on reducing conflict in Syria and other areas -- this prevents the creation of refugees.  While Russia, Iran, China and others prop up the Assad regime, ISIS and other factions attempt to topple him.

According to government data, the average red snapper weighs around 8 pounds. That means fishermen can catch 518,750 fish.  The feds set a two-fish limit per day. That means, in a 10-day season, about 25,937 fishermen would hit the federal waters each day to catch their quota. If, on average, four people ride on a boat, that means each day 6,484 boats would have to leave docks along the Gulf Coast, every day.  For those numbers to make sense, you would literally have to have hundreds or thousands of boats leaving all of those Gulf Coast docks, every day.'  Do you think that's happening when the 10-day season normally includes just one weekend? Come on.

Under H.R. 1004, agencies would be barred from communicating through social media and other means to promote or solicit public support for agency actions.  The bill would also set requirements for communications that are allowed and would direct agencies to disclose additional information about regulatory activities.  In a December 2015 letter, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that Environmental Protection Agency communications related to the “Waters of the U.S.” rule violated prohibitions on spending money on publicity, propaganda and grassroots lobbying.   In another instance, the Homeland Security Department didn’t provide advance notice or an opportunity for public comment when it adopted the DAPA policy granting deferred action to undocumented immigrants with children who are U.S. citizens, according to a report on the bill from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  Agencies should be focused on their core mission and use what resources are available for communications to raise the public's awareness/solicit public comment - not to push an agenda. This is true regardless of which party is in the White House.

Each of us have personal opinions on the law that are drawn mostly from experience (my family has an ACA plan, and we're paying more and getting less - others have a different story).   The objectives of comprehensive healthcare reform 8 years ago were pretty straightforward: improve access and quality, and lower costs. I support all of those objectives - but those objectives have not been met.   In the aggregate, we're worse off now than we were before:  • Premiums have increased by an average of 25% just this year. • Nearly 1/3 of all U.S. counties have only 1 insurer offering plans on their state’s exchange. • 34% fewer doctors and other health care providers accept Obamacare insurance compared to private insurance.   These are just a few examples...   Some core tenets of the American Health Care Act are to deliver relief from the individual and employer tax burdens required through the ACA, eliminate mandates that force people who don't want insurance into buying it, preserve important patient protections (pre-existing conditions/dependents staying on until 26) while creating mechanisms that give providers, payers and patients the opportunity to innovate the way care is delivered.   Encourage you to continue weighing in with our office so that we can keep incorporating your feedback into the process as this thing moves forward.  http://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/","link","http://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/","housegop.leadpages.co",32,24,7,0,0,0,2,3

A needs based spending approach would look at the numbers: traffic counts, highway dollars spent vs community hours saved to direct transportation spending, etc.  As we continue to work with the Administration on a federal transportation package, we're also emphasizing how critical it is to include ports and waterways, which are critical to US trade and economy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGarretGraves/photos/a.370989789747776.1073741828.369885249858230/713158455530906/?type=3",NA,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The letter attempts to suggest that the Snapper Barons are providing a public service by making the fish available to the “general public”.... But in reality, these prices rival the cost of prime filet mignon.  The “general public” I know cannot afford these prices.    The bottom line is that the letter represents an “alternative reality” where a select group of people gave themselves the winning lottery ticket and the rest of us are paying for it.  Unfortunately, the most affected are those of us in Louisiana and on the Gulf Coast simply wanting to enjoy one of our favorite family pastimes in the Sportsman’s Paradise -- fishing.

This will further delay the allocation of badly-needed flood relief funds that we appropriated in September. It is impossible to explain to flood victims why $1.6 billion in recovery dollars are stuck in the bureaucracy while homes remain gutted, moldy and un-insulated.   This also further challenges our efforts in Congress to provide additional flood relief dollars when not a penny of September funding has been allocated to flood victims. On August 19th, I urged that a contractor be hired to administer this program.    Taking away $250 million or more from flood victims and giving it contractors to administer this program and to take seven months or more to get the money out the door further victimizes our flood survivors.   This has nothing to do with politics, it is just frustrating and sloppy.  Finally, anyone that attempts to blame these delays on the federal systems lacks a fundamental understanding of the process and opportunities to expedite flood relief.","status",NA,NA,77,47,54,0,0,3,8,18

We need to find ways of expediting employee review processes, particularly when employees are responsible for Veterans’ lives.   This week the House passed the VA Accountability First Act, an important step in reforming the dysfunctional VA and getting our veterans the care they need in a more timely fashion. This legislation gives the VA Secretary more discretion in dealing with VA employees’ misconduct and poor performance – it also provides protections for whistleblowers at the agency, making it easier to hold employees accountable.

Sec. Carson’s office says that the state can start drawing down money from this line of credit upon both parties signing a letter sent to the governor this afternoon.   This means that the state now has the go ahead to mobilize its plan (is the plan ready?) and obligate funds. The process is simple: the state submits work orders/draws that are paid within 48 hours.  (What stops the state from having a pile of these ready to go?)  Here’s why we’re frustrated:  HUD informed us today that the state asked them to not release the $438 million appropriated in September until the Action Plan for the second tranche of money was also approved. That's like refusing to throw a drowning person a life raft because you're waiting on the rescue boat to come. Makes no sense.   You'd think the extra time would allow the state to ensure its spend plan was locked and loaded in preparation of the second approval.   Nope. In the state’s own words: “the Restore Louisiana Homeowner Assistance Program will begin in early April. It will consist of two main parts – an initial survey and the application [emphasis added]. The survey determines when a homeowner may apply for assistance.” So, the program starts mid-April with… paperwork. Only to be followed up with… a determination of when you may apply for assistance. But what about actually getting the assistance and when?  Further, the state says that “when the survey becomes available in April, more information will be available.” …So even at some undetermined time in April, even after the line of credit has been established, still NO money will go to homeowners. Not a single dollar will be going into a home until possibly 9 months after the flood – that’s outrageous.   The point is that this timeline could have been shortened had things been done more efficiently by the state.   It's April. The flood happened in August. This isn't a victory, it's a shame.If money was approved in September, how can anyone be content with April/May relief?","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGarretGraves/photos/a.370989789747776.1073741828.369885249858230/722469691266449/?type=3",NA,29,17,33,1,1,0,4,11

The $1.65 billion that is available TODAY to the state of Louisiana for flood recovery will never be wired  to a Louisiana-controlled account; that's not how it works. It will stay at the HUD CFO Accounting Center in Fort Worth and the state will draw down the money as necessary.  The first step is for the State to upload its Action Plan to HUD's software pictured in the screenshot. The reason it says $0 is because the state hasn't uploaded its plan.   Once the state does upload the plan, the process will work like this:   Let's say The Action Plan budgets $25 mm for drywall and the state needs to purchase $10 mm now.   The State submits a  draw request for $10 mm and then the state gets paid within 72 hours. Now the state’s drywall budget is $15mm and so on...   The bottom line is that the state has known for more than 191 days (Sept. 28 is when Congress appropriated funds) that it would receive federal disaster money through the CDGB program, and should be ready to disburse those funds. They're not ready.   Everything else you're hearing is noise.  Louisiana is one of the most frequent users of DRGR. The state should be able to submit action plan in its sleep.

Students submit entries to their representative’s office, and panels of district artists select the winning entries. Winners are recognized both in their district and at an annual awards ceremony in Washington, DC.   The winning works are displayed for one year at the U.S. Capitol.

The National Coastal Zone Management Program is a critically important voluntary federal-state partnership that protects, restores, and responsibly develops our nation's coastal communities and resources by balancing economic development, coastal uses, and natural resource protection.   NOAA's investment of more than $5.3M over FY16 and FY17 is leveraging over $4.3M in state funds.These funds will support jobs and provide continued assistance to the Louisiana coastal management program to address many important coastal issues in the state including coastal hazards, habitat protection and restoration, and water quality.  For example, one project will begin a process to develop new and revised standard operating procedures for Local Coastal Parish programs related to floodplain mitigation and participation in the National Flood Insurance Program and the Community Rating System. These new procedures will help increase community resilience and guard against hazards by improving construction and development in high hazard areas of coastal Louisiana.

We cannot allow the tragic shootings of 2016 or the fallout to define us or our community, but we can learn from those experiences.  All loss of life is tragic.  We’ve already lost Deputy Brad Garafola, Officer Matthew Gerald, Officer Montrell Jackson and Alton Sterling.  Deputy Nick Tullier is an amazing warrior overcoming all obstacles, but his life is forever changed and Deputy Bruce Simmons continues to recover from being shot.  Nothing good has resulted from these shootings.  Right or wrong, each loss represents a loved one, a friend, a confident, a husband, a community member – a life or part of life suddenly, prematurely, and in many cases, senselessly taken.     The abundant evidence in this case –video footage, eyewitness accounts and other sources – faced the extensive scrutiny of both President Obama’s Department of Justice and the current Administration’s. Due to the prolific evidence, this decision should have been issued sooner; however, we trust that this decision is the product of a meticulous and fair investigation.  The Capital Region has endured tremendous hardship – this tragedy, an ambush attack on law enforcement, historical flooding and the recent fatal shooting of a Baton Rouge Deputy.  We now have two choices:  1) We can come together as a community, be neighbors and lift one another up as we did in the August flood, or 2) We can, once again, go down the path of violence, death and loss.  Only one makes sense.  I was born and raised in the Baton Rouge area.  What I experienced on July 17 when our officers were shot was unrecognizable.  It was like we were in a foreign country – not home.  An outsider spread his evil and hatred here.  Someone from out of state hijacked our community.  While Baton Rouge has its share of imperfections, we are better than that.   From here, let’s work with our new mayor to convert the city we have into the city we want. I urge our community to continue to pray for the victims and their families and to pray for peace and understanding.","status",NA,NA,291,34,45,33,0,1,0,4

We talked through some legitimate concerns people have with the AHCA and were able to clear up some of the misconceptions about the bill.    Story after story reaffirmed the extraordinary financial, regulatory and access  challenges present throughout our current system, but I'm encouraged by the thoughtful dialogue and will use the ideas discussed to continue to advocate for our constituents as the current and subsequent reform bills work through the Senate and the legislative process.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGarretGraves/photos/a.370989789747776.1073741828.369885249858230/743791305800954/?type=3",NA,18,9,2,0,0,0,0,1

When you go to the grocery store for example, you have all the info needed to decide whether to buy name brand or store brand and you're the one who decides based on circumstance, finances, preference, etc... That's not the case in healthcare today. How many times have we all gone to the pharmacy to get a prescription filled, approached the counter and literally had no clue whether we were about to pay $10 or $100 or more? And that's just one example.   Lee Zurik rolled out a new investigative series that takes a deeper look into how the lack of transparency in healthcare can distort prices and hurt people. I highly recommend you watch it.   We're continuing to work on policy changes to advance consumer practice in healthcare too, so stay tuned for more details to come.   http://www.fox8live.com/story/35334208/zurik-absolutely-ridiculous-medical-bills-show-critical-need-for-transparency","link","http://www.fox8live.com/story/35334208/zurik-absolutely-ridiculous-medical-bills-show-critical-need-for-transparency","fox8live.com",29,28,10,2,1,0,0,0

Since first serving in the House in 2015, Congress has allocated a total of $20.7 million toward the canal. This amount is grossly insufficient to finish the project, but the $20.7 million since 2015 represents the vast majority of funding for the project in the last 10 years, when funding for the project had essentially dried up.   Seeing Comite through to completion remains a top priority of mine and is critical to a true, long-term recovery in South Louisiana. Until we address the flood protection problem, lives and property remain at risk.  We also announced funding for the following projects:  $500,000 for continued wastewater and environmental improvements in Baton Rouge $500,000 for wastewater improvements in Ascension Parish $450,000 to complete the justification analysis to deepen the Mississippi River to 50 feet, thereby allowing for larger commercial vessels $9 million for continued project construction in the Louisiana Coastal Area (restoration of Coastal Louisiana)  Read more: http://www.wafb.com/story/35529377/millions-in-funding-approved-for-comite-diversion","link","http://www.wafb.com/story/35529377/millions-in-funding-approved-for-comite-diversion","wafb.com",80,17,24,4,0,0,0,0

We will continue to pray for him, his wife Jennifer and kids as he goes through the healing process.  We also pray for the staff and others wounded in today's attack.    The heroic efforts of the Capitol Police protection detail cannot be overstated – their sacrificial patriotism prevented a massacre. This hero and shero risked their lives to save many others. God Bless them, and we pray for their speedy recovery.   Today is sobering and frustrating. It is sobering because it reminds us how quickly these senseless attacks can destroy lives. These can be fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, friends and neighbors.  They are not nameless or faceless individuals.   The attack is frustrating because I expect that this will ultimately demonstrate that words and rhetoric have consequences. Over the last several months, verbal attacks, divisiveness, and polarization have reached inappropriate and unhealthy levels in our government. Many thoughtlessly lob verbal grenades without considering the consequences.   The 435 members of the House represent the great diversity of our amazing nation. We bring these broad perspectives and priorities of our districts together in the House to advance America.  It is our job to find common ground and to work together to actually solve problems. We can disagree and have different perspectives without being disagreeable.  Sadly, it seems, politics in many cases has devolved into a dehumanized ‎blood sport. Contributing to the problem, many in the media and bloggers have evolved from reporters to editorialists and provokers spreading misinformation and sensationalism. I apologize for any contribution I may have caused.     All of us should take a big step back‎ to remember and embrace that above the tags of left, right, liberal, conservative and every title in between – we are FIRST Americans. This bond we share is more important than the politics we don’t. We must work together, from the foundation of our shared love of our country, our heritage and our freedom, to constructively create the America our countrymen and women deserve. Binding up the wounds will take time, but we must start now.   ###","status",NA,NA,400,59,91,45,0,1,32,0

Graves introduced the bill to fight poverty, support families and promote self-sufficiency while helping stem the tide of government dependence.  Graves’ legislation builds upon the successful track record of mandatory federal work requirements first established in President Bill Clinton’s 1996 “welfare reform,” taking a similar approach to strengthen the work requirements for “able-bodied adults without dependents” who are food stamp recipients through SNAP.  “There are talented people across our country who aren’t pursuing the full potential of their capabilities largely because government incentives make it more profitable in some cases to stay home and collect welfare than to pursue personal growth and responsibility through work,” said Graves. “Government needs to provide a safety net for the vulnerable, but it’s become a lifestyle for some to actively choose government assistance over work – that’s a disservice to those people, the economy and the taxpayer. We have to restructure incentives to achieve the outcomes we want and to get capable people off the sidelines and involved in building America’s future. This bill is a small step toward that goal.”   Click the link to read more. https://garretgraves.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/graves-introduces-common-sense-snap-reform-bill","link","https://garretgraves.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/graves-introduces-common-sense-snap-reform-bill","garretgraves.house.gov",158,43,28,15,0,0,0,1

The additional dollars will help reimburse the cost of response and recovery efforts at 16 educational facilities across the parish.   The following schools will receive funding through today’s announcement:  Brookstown Magnet Middle School, Greenbrier Elementary School, Glen Oaks Park Elementary School, Glen Oaks High School, Howell Park Elementary School, Lanier Elementary School, Merrydale Elementary School, Northdale Superintendent’s Academy, Park Forest Elementary School, Park Forest Middle School, Twin Oaks Elementary School and Westdale Middle School.  Funding will also assist with recovery efforts at four administrative buildings.  East Baton Rouge Schools have received more than $14 million for flood damage. FEMA has awarded more than $87 million for schools for this disaster. The Public Assistance (PA) program has obligated more than $388 million to reimburse local and state governments as well as certain private nonprofits for the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities and infrastructure.  Funds also cover debris removal and emergency response activities in designated parishes. PA helps to repair or replace critical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and schools. PA offers supplemental financial assistance on a cost-sharing basis. FEMA typically reimburses 75 percent of eligible PA expenses. However, FEMA will reimburse applicants 90 percent of eligible PA expenses given the magnitude of the August floods. https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/07/05/east-baton-rouge-schools-receive-64-million-more-disaster-funds","link","https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/07/05/east-baton-rouge-schools-receive-64-million-more-disaster-funds","fema.gov",46,5,5,5,0,0,1,0

The bill converts existing Russia sanctions into law, imposes new sanctions on Russia for assisting the Assad regime and requires any Russia sanctions relief by the president to be subject to congressional review.  It also introduces consequences for anyone contributing to Iran’s ballistic missile program and imposes sanctions on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps for their support of terrorism.  And in North Korea, the bill sanctions entities using slave labor and tightens the reins on illicit trade by targeting its shipping industry and access to international ports. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/25/house-approves-russian-sanctions-bill.html","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/25/house-approves-russian-sanctions-bill.html","foxnews.com",57,17,3,0,1,0,0,1

More than 29,600 flood claims have been filed for this disaster in southern Louisiana.   WHAT:          A Proof of Loss form is a sworn statement made by the policyholder that substantiates the insurance claim.                                                                                                                                              WHO:            The extended deadline applies to all policyholders who filed a flood claim following the August 2016 severe storms in southern Louisiana. FEMA’s Bulletin to Write Your Own companies and NFIP Direct Servicing Agent on this extension is available online here.             WHY:             This deadline extension ensures that policyholders have every reasonable opportunity to request payment for all covered losses. The additional time allows policyholders to work with their insurance company to finalize claims.  This is the fifth extension of the deadline for sending proofs of loss in Louisiana for claims related to the severe storms commencing on August 9, 2016 through August 31, 2016.  NOTE:           The extension also applies to supplemental claims. Policy holders can submit a supplemental claim if additional damage is found while making home repairs. FEMA urges policyholders to submit all forms as soon as possible.","status",NA,NA,7,2,10,1,0,0,0,0

Multiple government and independent reports show that every one dollar invested in prevention and resiliency saves as much as four dollars in disaster response costs. But our government is stuck on stupid: instead of making these investments on the front-end, it’s dead-set on this broken process of coming in after a disaster and spending exponentially more dollars.   We have to break this cycle and redesign policies around resiliency to stop hemorrhaging billions of dollars after the fact - that approach is wasteful and leaves our communities, economies and ecosystems just as susceptible as they were before the event.

How does that make sense? Not to mention our current tax code is incredibly draining on our economy, costing us an average of $1 TRILLION dollars annually.  Since the tax code is so complex, hardworking Americans have to spend their time, and money (over $400 billion a year) on accountants, tax lawyers, and other costs in tax compliance.  Americans spend more than 6 billion hours complying with the tax code annually, and over $400 billion of their hard-earned money.    The American people shouldn’t have to spend their finances on tax compliance… They should be able to invest, save, and spend their money how they see fit. I am advocating for a complete overhaul of our tax system and replacing it with a SIMPLE plan.  Filing your taxes shouldn’t be this difficult.

This project was expedited, along with a handful of other similar situations due to the flood with the hope of being open within approximately one year.    However, once work began, it was obvious that the initial plans for pile length needed revision to be longer.  As a frame of reference, these piles will be more than three times as long as those removed from the previous structure in order to meet current standards.

Louisiana's exclusion from this bill is ridiculous and we are fighting to fix it.   We fully support providing this relief to Harvey, Irma and other recent flood victims who certainly need it, but we've been pushing for nearly 14 months for this relief for the 1,000 year flood event that occurred in Louisiana last fall. Our 1,000 year flood wasn't the result of a named storm, but its impact was historically devastating.   When disaster strikes, affected homeowners shouldn't be subject to the limbo of waiting/hoping for ad hoc government/congressional intervention. What's needed is a set of tools that can be leveraged to accelerate recovery. While we continue working for immediate relief for recent and 2016 flood victims, we also want to see a permanent fix so that future victims can have more predictability and stability in the wake of disaster.

Going to try again:  1) Puerto Rico was badly damaged and food/water supplies are badly needed.  2) Today, the Dept of Homeland Security waived the Jones Act (allows for foreign vessels to travel to two or more points in the U.S.).  The reason they did this is because there was a belief that cargo could not get TO the island.   3) At a hearing this morning, it became very clear that getting cargo to Puerto Rico's port facilities was not the problem.  Rather, the issue is actually distributing the food/water/supplies FROM Puerto Rico's port to the disaster victims.  The trucks, roads, bridges and other transportation systems on the island are damaged so they are having trouble getting out of the port.  Several thousand shipping containers are in Puerto Rico now full of relief supplies. 4) The point was that the federal government had better not sit back and do nothing now that the Jones Act has been waived because this will not solve the problem of getting relief supplies to those in need.  More needs to be done.  5) FEMA, DHS, our military and others need to use aircraft to get supplies to disaster victims.  We also need to be working to restore infrastructure like roads and bridges as quickly as possible.    Hope that helps. ###  As was made clear at this morning's hearing, this is a solution in search of a problem. There are several thousand shipping containers sitting at the docks in PR today. The problem isn't the Jones Act. The problem is that there was a hurricane. Logistical systems are destroyed. Trucks, highways and other transportation systems are gone. They can't get food and supplies to hurrucane victims. Already, two-thirds of the commerce arriving in Puerto Rico arrives on foreign vessels.   Anyone that thinks this waiver just solved the problem is confused. I'd argue that it just did more harm than good. We have a huge shipping industry on the Gulf Coast that needs the jobs and economic activity now to help economies recover from their disasters. You just took American jobs and sent them overseas.   The governor of PR needs to focus on real recovery for the island and stop asking for unicorns.  http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2017/09/white_house_waives_jones_act_t.html","link","http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2017/09/white_house_waives_jones_act_t.html","nola.com",159,78,51,4,0,3,16,12

Every year, our office is given the opportunity to nominate Louisiana high school seniors to United States Service Academies.    In 2016, Aleah Harris came to our office for a Congressional nomination and was given the opportunity to attend the United States Air Force Academy’s Prep School.  After a successful year there, she was granted another nomination and will soon attend the United States Air Force Academy full-time.    When Aleah arrived to the AFA Prep School, she wad disappointed to learn that there were not enough lady players to form a women’s soccer team, but she was soon given the opportunity to join the men’s team where she excelled.  She also excelled in trig/pre-calculus and was in the top 10% of her class for overall physical fitness. This year, she has made time management a priority and is thankful for the bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood that she has formed at the prep school.   Aleah wanted to recommend that all students interested in attending an academy do their research on each of them and start preparing for the application and physical fitness exam as soon as possible. Over the next four years. Aleah plans to ""embrace every aspect of life at the Air Force Academy and to learn as much as I can.""  She is majoring in Computer Sciences and hopes to pursue a career in special investigation after graduation. Good luck Aleah! Continue to make us proud!  Service Academy nomination applications are currently being accepted from students throughout the Sixth Congressional District who are interested in attending one of our Nation’s prestigious Service Academies.

Rainer Weiss, an LSU adjunct professor and MIT professor emeritus, will share this year's Nobel Prize in physics with California Institute of Technology professors emeriti Barry Barish and Kip Thorne. The professors were recognized for advancing the world's first detection of gravitational waves, a development made possible by a large research facility in Livingston Parish.  The parish is home to a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO; companion facilities operate in Hanford, Washington, and Pisa, Italy.  Albert Einstein theorized the world was shaped by gravitational waves, and thanks to LIGO researchers, we now have physical proof.  With admirable humility, Weiss said the Nobel really recognizes the work of thousands. Among that number are the many local researchers and officials who helped make LIGO's work possible.

The lede should be “Shortfall in coastal funding the predictable consequence of uniformed policymaking,” and the rest of the story should be an explanation of how this is an example of the impact of regulations when they are not fully thought through and that federal policy decisions have lasting effects. The story seems to suggest that the revenue shortfall is because of proposals to cut the GOMESA program, but that’s a misunderstanding of reality; GOMESA is intact (watch this video for more on that: https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGarretGraves/videos/777132952466789/).   Here’s what’s really going on. GOMESA funding – by design – is directly correlated to production levels. When there’s less production, there’s less revenue for coastal projects. There’s less production today in part because of offshore energy policies that go back to President Obama: the moratorium/permatorium in 2011 and the well control/BOP regulation finalized in 2016, which has been a functional moratorium on production in the Gulf.    What’s ironic is that these policies where pushed under a pretext of “protecting the environment,” but it’s clear now (as we predicted then: https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGarretGraves/videos/527256207454466/ )that these policies are actually harming the environment by preventing restoration and will result in more federal expenditures by delaying important flood control projects.","link","http://thelensnola.org/2017/10/18/louisiana-faces-unexpected-shortfall-in-major-source-of-funding-for-coastal-protection/","thelensnola.org",4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0

We could allow this project to be done through the Corps of Engineers - but the reality is that there has only been one project finished over the past 20 years in Louisiana by the Corps (outside of post-Katrina projects, which were completed outside of normal circumstances). Bottom line is that waiting on the Corps is not a viable path; we've been doing that for 30 years.  The other option - the one we've been advocating for - puts the state parishes, the Amite River Basin Commission and others in the driver’s seat. We have identified $2 Billion in federal funds that have been brought to the state of Louisiana. Enough of those dollars could be used to not only advance, but to finish the Comite River Diversion Canal Project.

Veteran's care is high priority and VA reform is long overdue. As of Veterans Day 2017, the Trump Administration has enforced strict accountability standards for VA personnel, with over 1163 employees fired, 387 suspended, and 61 demoted.    Congress has stepped up too. This year, the House passed 43 pieces of legislation to reform the VA and other VA assistance programs, many of which have passed the Senate and signed by the President.

This will improve the health of the economy, increase wages and create more employment opportunities in Louisiana and other states. All income brackets are reduced by the legislation and the standard deduction is nearly doubled. To put this in perspective, the average American family of four making $55,000 will pay no taxes.  This is a huge win and I look forward to working together to continue to address priorities and help to perfect the bill through the legislative process. Specifically, we need to ensure students and retirees are treated fairly and that the value of a reformed historic and new market credit program is considered.

There are over 200 sanctuary cities in the US, and according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, illegal immigrants account for 75% of federal sentences for drug possession and made up more than a third of all federal sentences. This is absurd.  The CLEAR Act ensures that state and local governments have the tools they need to help the federal government get these criminals out of the country, and also withholds funding to sanctuary cities that prohibit officers from doing their job. The bill will also require the Department of Homeland Security to train state and local police in enforcing the United States immigration laws.  We must make sure that our law enforcement has the tools and training they need to carry out our immigration laws and to do their jobs. Many states and cities have not prepared their officers to deport these criminals, and some even prohibit them from following the laws. It’s unacceptable, and I think that the CLEAR Act helps put us on the right track in preparing our police and making our country safer.","status",NA,NA,87,34,9,6,3,1,1,11

Per NOAA:   ### Today, NOAA Fisheries will announce the certification of the Louisiana Recreational Creel (LA Creel) survey design. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) uses LA Creel as an alternative general survey to estimate recreational fishing catch and effort. It was designed to provide catch estimates for state drainage basins, particularly for offshore fisheries, that are more precise than the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) general survey estimates, and also to provide preliminary estimates weekly during the fishing season.   Since 2014, Louisiana and NOAA Fisheries, along with outside consultants, have been working collaboratively to develop and refine the LA Creel sampling and estimation methods. LDFW developed the survey design, and MRIP provided technical support for subsequent improvement. MRIP also coordinated the independent peer review of the design.   Now that the LA Creel survey design has been certified, it is eligible for federal funding to support ongoing improvements and implementation. Use of LA Creel catch statistics in stock assessments and management actions requires their conversion into a ""common currency"" that makes them comparable to historical MRIP estimates. Implementation of such a conversion requires development of peer-reviewed scientifically valid methods.   LA Creel is one of several Gulf of Mexico surveys that has been developed by the States with technical support from MRIP. Survey designs to supplement MRIP catch and effort estimates for red snapper are currently under review for certification in Alabama and Mississippi. Additionally, Florida has developed a supplemental reef fish survey design that will be peer reviewed in February 2018.   The process of supporting the development and certification of new survey designs demonstrates MRIP's commitment to working with our State and regional partners to meet their unique data needs and advance new methods and technologies. This is critical to improving recreational fishing data collection efforts and ensuring fishing opportunities for future generations.  http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/lacreel","link","http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/lacreel","wlf.louisiana.gov",44,10,3,0,0,0,0,0
