Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Emily and her husband often had to make the impossible choice between paying for her health coverage or going into debt. The Affordable Care Act has had a tremendous impact on her life, and today, her family of four gets quality coverage for less than the cost of her old individual plan, which didn’t even cover maternity care.

As a former investigative reporter, I’ve been extremely disturbed by the steady stream of false information coming from the President and his Administration – from undeniably false allegations of widespread voter fraud to something as petty and small as arguing about the size of his inaugural audience. And once presented with facts, one of Trump’s top advisors responded that the media should ‘keep its mouth shut.’  This is not normal, and it goes well beyond the normal disagreements between political parties.  Just one week in, President Trump’s erratic temperament and utter lack of preparedness is already wreaking havoc on the American people. His impulsive federal hiring freeze could break the backbone of our VA system. His diplomacy-by-tweet approach to foreign affairs is damaging our credibility around the world. His reckless demand to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it will increase prescription drug costs for seniors, deny care to millions of Americans with preexisting conditions and put the profits of insurance companies ahead of the health of our families.  This week, President Trump also broke his signature promise to the American people. After years of making the ridiculous claim that ‘Mexico will pay for the wall,’ President Trump flip-flopped and now American taxpayers will have to foot the bill.  The Presidency doesn’t come with training wheels – I strongly urge President Trump to put down his unsecured cell phone, turn off the TV and start doing the job he was elected to do. The American people do not care about the size of his inaugural audience or the ratings of his interviews. They care about their jobs, their health care and their children’s future. They deserve competent, stable and honest leadership from the President of the United States.  Democrats stand ready to work with President Trump if he will end this behavior and start putting working families first, but if this week is a model for the rest of his Presidency, we’ll have no choice but to resist.","link","https://bustos.house.gov/congresswoman-cheri-bustos-statement-president-trumps-first-week-office/","bustos.house.gov",1224,279,349,142,10,9,14,52

After seven years of refusing to work in a bipartisan manner to improve the Affordable Care Act, Washington Republicans have now released their bill, which will lead to less coverage, higher costs and fewer protections for the American people.  Trumpcare undermines the economic security of older Americans and leaves behind millions of hardworking families across the heartland. While the Affordable Care Act helped Illinois’ seniors save $1,000 per year on prescription drug costs, Washington Republicans are proposing an age tax that will charge older Americans five times more for their care.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in the 17th Congressional District has been cut in half. Additionally, the Medicaid expansion has been a lifeline for many of our rural hospitals and clinics while helping them expand and provide new services and programs to patients in rural Illinois.  As a former investigative reporter, I’ve also been extremely disturbed by the lack of transparency surrounding Trumpcare. Rather than allowing the American people to fully examine their health care repeal bill, Washington Republicans are attempting to rush it through Congress before it sees the light of day. We still do not know how much the bill will cost taxpayers, how much more older Americans will pay, how much premiums will rise, how many Americans will lose their coverage or how many patients will go bankrupt because of medical bills under Trumpcare.  While many questions remain about Trumpcare, it’s crystal clear that this bill is a prescription for disaster for older Americans and hardworking families in our heartland.","link","https://bustos.house.gov/bustos-statement-trumpcare-washington-republicans-attempt-repeal-affordable-care-act/","bustos.house.gov",195,59,59,5,1,1,16,34

Instead of laying out a real strategy to create jobs and grow the economy across rural America, President Trump has introduced a budget that will do the exact opposite by making some of his deepest cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  His cuts to rural economic development funding will mean lost jobs and fewer opportunities for small town Americans. His decision to slash federal dollars for roads, bridges, airports and water infrastructure will ensure that thousands of hardworking men and women are left behind. President Trump is choosing to damage our agricultural economy by making it harder for our growers and producers to sell their crops by cutting agricultural research, market data collection, and closing local offices across rural America.  During the campaign, President Trump promised to stand up for family farmers and make meaningful investments in our infrastructure, but once again he is proving that it doesn’t matter what he says, it matters what he does. We absolutely need to make government more efficient and cut costs where it makes sense, but we need to do it in a way that puts hardworking families first. That is the exact opposite of what President Trump’s budget does.","link","https://bustos.house.gov/congresswoman-cheri-bustos-highlights-president-trumps-budget-hurts-rural-america/","bustos.house.gov",220,63,78,1,4,2,30,47

Under TrumpCare, people with pre-existing conditions will be priced out of the insurance market with nowhere to turn for affordable care. Older Americans will still be stuck with an age tax and charged five times more for basic coverage, just as they approach retirement. And lifetime limits will return – cutting off care when families need it the most.   “But this debate isn’t just about statistics. That’s why in my first ‘Hear from the Heartland’ series, I spoke with Anastasia, whose son Gryphon has cerebral palsy. Children like Gryphon deserve far better than TrumpCare – he didn’t choose to be born with a pre-existing condition, and he shouldn’t suffer because of this disastrous, indefensible bill. It’s time for Republicans and Democrats to work across the aisle to fix what’s broken in health care and bring down health care costs for all Americans.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepCheri/videos/1940058846020323/",NA,60,18,14,3,0,0,7,8

As a result of the Affordable Care Act, the Thickstens were able to find affordable, comprehensive coverage. Like Jim says in the video, the medication he receives “allows [him] to be a husband and a dad, and an employee. Without that medication, [he’d] be in a lot of trouble.” But under Trumpcare, they could lose access to their care – and affordable medication – because of Jim’s preexisting condition, and ultimately hit a lifetime limit on insurance coverage, forcing their family to choose between sickness and debt.  While I’m pleased that the Senate delayed their vote on health care, the fight to protect hardworking families from the devastating Trumpcare bill is far from over. Families like the Thickstens who speak out about the real impact of this bill are truly making a difference, and their voices are the most important in this debate. Nobody should be forced into bankruptcy or priced out of having quality health care because they have a preexisting condition, so I’ll continue fighting for families like the Thickstens who simply want to work hard, live a healthy life and raise their son.

She has a condition that causes her body to develop blood hemangiomas on her colon and small intestines – a potentially life threatening condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Amber regularly had to get blood and iron infusions, which cost her $3,000 each time and created significant medical debt. Because of the Affordable Care Act, Amber can now get the treatment she needs at prices she can afford.  President Trump promised ‘insurance for everybody,’ but if Washington Republicans move ahead with their plan to take health care away from millions of Americans, it’s people like Amber who will be forced into debt as their out of pocket costs explode. Hardworking men and women like Amber aren’t asking for a handout – they just want stable, affordable health care that covers life’s unexpected challenges. Instead of pushing for a dangerous repeal of the Affordable Care Act without replacement, the Republican Majority should reach across the aisle and work with Democrats to fix what’s broken in health care and bring down costs for all Americans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepCheri/videos/2024175027608704/",NA,104,33,14,1,0,5,17,2

This is dangerous.   Last year, after a brave survivor from Stanford University shared her story with the world, I spoke on the House Floor about this epidemic. I said it then and I will say it again today – far too many women are sexually assaulted during their undergraduate years, and I will not stay silent until meaningful action is taken by Congress on this issue.

The last Trumpcare bill would have taken health care away from nearly 45,000 people in my Congressional District, killed 60,000 Illinois jobs and imposed an age tax that would have cost older Americans up to five times more than others. With nearly 700 rural hospitals already considered vulnerable, ending Medicaid as we know it would force many of them to shut their doors for good, undermining access to quality care in rural communities and ripping the economic heart out of small towns across the country.  While we’re still waiting for a final breakdown of how deeply this new Trumpcare bill would hurt hardworking Illinoisans, we already know that, just like the last Trumpcare bill, it will lead to higher costs and less coverage. That’s why it’s already being opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society and even several Republican Governors. Every day that the Republican Congress wastes on Trumpcare is a day that we could be working on bipartisan proposals to lower the costs and improve the quality of health coverage.","link","https://bustos.house.gov/congresswoman-bustos-statement-washington-republicans-revived-effort-raise-health-care-costs-limit-coverage/","bustos.house.gov",287,115,58,11,11,2,33,65

Instead of sticking millions of Americans with skyrocketing health care costs, Republicans should work across the aisle to lower the cost of coverage and expand access to more Americans.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/10/13/daily-202-throwing-a-bomb-into-the-insurance-markets-trump-now-owns-the-broken-health-care-system/59dff67a30fb041a74e75d48/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_daily202-759am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory","washingtonpost.com",291,176,116,6,10,7,41,163

I strongly disagree with the Washington Republicans' budget proposal that will give massive tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy while raising taxes on the middle-class and cutting a trillion dollars from Medicare and Medicaid. Because Speaker Ryan's budget adds more than a trillion dollars to the deficit, this plan intentionally sets Congress up for a budget shortfall which will inevitably lead to Washington Republicans demanding more cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, workforce training and job-creating infrastructure programs.  Instead, we should be working across the aisle to cut taxes for the middle-class, bring down the cost of health care, help small businesses grow and expand workforce training programs to get more Americans into good-paying jobs. As Democrats, we have proposed a Better Deal to the American people that is built on a foundation of delivering better jobs, better wages and a better future for all.

Rodney Davis and I introduced to level the playing field for small communities recovering from natural disasters in today’s Disaster Supplemental Bill.
