I am encouraged by President Donald Trump‚Äôs commitment to putting patients at the center of our health care system, to reforming the tax code so that families can save more of their hard-earned dollars, and to reining in federal regulations to return power to our local communities. These solutions reflect the ideas that we ran on to provide relief from Obamacare‚Äôs broken promises and unleash economic growth nationwide.   Our agenda is bold because Americans demanded change and a better way. The House has already made progress by passing over a dozen jobs bills to stop harmful regulations, and the wheels are in motion to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a  plan that gives people more affordable choices and increased access to the care they need. As the health subcommittee chairman, I hope Democrats join us in this effort because as the President said, Obamacare is collapsing. We must move forward with reforms that protect our constituents from a failing system.  President Trump‚Äôs speech tonight was inspirational and it struck the right tone. America‚Äôs future is bright, and we want to empower people who make it so. That is an optimistic vision everyone can come together on.   http://tiberi.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=395117","link","http://tiberi.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=395117","tiberi.house.gov",160,112,16,24,6,1,0,43

Next year, 47 counties will have zero coverage options‚Äîthat includes 18 counties in Ohio.   Medicaid is also on an unsustainable fiscal path. If we don‚Äôt act, federal and state Medicaid spending will top $1 trillion in 2027. That isn‚Äôt just a budget issue, it is a moral one that threatens care for the most vulnerable citizens across the country.  What can we do to fix it?

We will simplify the code, make it easier for everyone to file their taxes, and allow middle-income Americans to keep more of their paychecks so they have the confidence and ability to save, plan for the future and get ahead.   We have more work to do to transition this framework into legislation. During that process, it is one of my top priorities to ensure that tax reform includes tools that unleash economic growth and job creation in communities that need it the most. This is an historic opportunity to overhaul our code and identify solutions that work to fight poverty and ensure more people‚Äîno matter their background or zip code‚Äîare empowered to succeed. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I‚Äôm honored to be a voice in this process and I look forward to advocating for essential reforms that will support a stronger Ohio and nation.
