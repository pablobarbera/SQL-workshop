Trumpcare would put my daughter’s future in danger.” That’s what Zoe Lihn’s mother told me today.   All too often, discussions of the policies we debate in Washington can get lost under layers of numbers and data. Yet when it comes to health care, it is clear that all politics is personal.   When people ask me about why I am fighting so hard to protect the Affordable Care Act, I’m often brought to thinking of Zoe. She was born with a heart defect in May 2010. She faced her first of three heart surgeries at 15 hours old. Remember, this was in the days before the Affordable Care Act did away with lifetime caps on care. By six months old, Zoe was halfway to the lifetime limit her insurer placed on her care.   Think of it – just 6 months had gone by, and already she was facing the possibility of an insurance company saying her life had cost too much money. And that wasn’t even factoring in the reality that she would be carrying a pre-existing condition that required attention and care for the rest of her life.    That is the reality that we face if Republicans pass Trumpcare.  People all across the country – seniors, children, and veterans – will have their futures thrown into jeopardy.   Every American deserves a chance for a healthy life. That’s why I fought for the Affordable Care Act as Speaker.

Jeremy Dilts knows it goes beyond that. ACA and its expansion of Medicaid have played a crucial role in the years that followed his son's illness.  “It’s been seven years since my son, Eli, was diagnosed with Stage IV brain cancer. The Affordable Care Act helped us get Eli the treatment he needed – but our fight isn’t over.  “Even now, we count on Medicaid to afford the physical, occupational, and speech therapy sessions Eli needs every week – not to mention the costs of his medication. These therapies have so far helped Eli go from wheelchair bound and barely able to speak or to eat ‘normal’ food to a walking, talking, and often joking young man without dietary concerns. If the Republicans’ Trumpcare plan becomes law, there’s no way we’d be able to get Eli the treatment he still needs.  If Trumpcare takes away his Medicaid, my son won’t get to become the fully independent member of society that he deserves to be.” – Jeremy Dilts of Indiana  p.s.

I have no family history of the disease, and I lead a healthy lifestyle. Everyone was shocked. While I have insurance through my employer, I am scared that should I ever lose my job or wish to pursue my own company or start working freelance again, that I could be denied coverage based on my pre-existing condition. Without insurance, just one life-saving chemotherapy infusion costs $70k. My particular type of breast cancer has a high rate of recurrence. I have barely begun to live my life. I didn't ask for cancer. In fact, I was doing everything to avoid it: Eating well and working out regularly.
