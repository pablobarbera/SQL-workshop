The synthetic drug is laced with elephant tranquilizers, an opioid known as “carfentanil” – a drug so strong that it can kill a dog with just a whiff, and kill users with a single dose.  The opioid and drug epidemic in the United States will continue to worsen unless we take action. Last week, Congress passed a government funding bill that directed $500 million to fund the implementation of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) that strengthens and expands resources to help victims, and protect our families and communities from this epidemic.   With opioid-related addiction plaguing the state of Illinois, it’s important that we as a community work together to raise awareness of the changing threats that those suffering from addiction may be facing.

May is #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth, and although the month is ending, the conversation of mental health must continue to build.

The innovation around self-driving vehicle technology carries a lot of potential to improve the safety of our roads as well as quality of life for folks in IL-16, especially for the elderly, disabled, and individuals underserved by public transit. This morning’s committee markup opened up the conversation on clarifying federal and state roles as we ensure proper oversight of the changes self-driving cars will undoubtedly have on our daily lives. Illinois lost nearly 1,100 lives on our roads last year alone, so safety is and always will be the underlying concern as we continue this conversation.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepKinzinger/videos/1830698356957038/",NA,29,19,1,1,0,0,0,1

An important reminder to drivers in IL-16 and across our great state: please keep your eyes on the road while driving. Illinois tragically lost 1,081 lives in motor vehicle crashes in 2016. It is estimated that 94% of car accidents are attributable to human error and unfortunately the number of fatalities due to distracted cell phone usage is on the rise.  These 1,081 lives were lives of mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, friends, neighbors – precious lives that could have been saved with a little more caution and care. If your eyes are on your phone, your mind is elsewhere and it’s a lose-lose for everyone on the road. Safe driving habits will help each of us protect ourselves and our loved ones.

It’s becoming more and more challenging to know when we come across disinformation.  Here in Congress, I’m working to address this issue. Through legislation and writing to social media giants, we must find a way to combat this disinformation in our news cycle and our society.   I was particularly alarmed by the report this week that confirmed Russia paid for Facebook ads to push propaganda in attempts to influence the 2016 Presidential election. Such attempts at interference is a clear undermining of our democratic system and it is beyond unacceptable.
