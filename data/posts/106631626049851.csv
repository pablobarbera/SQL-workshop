The terrorists used a car bomb and two suicide attackers in their assault shortly after midnight on the army outpost in the town of al-Dour on Tikrit's outskirts, killing two officers and two soldiers, the sources said. Gunmen separately attacked the police station a short distance away and set fire to the building before fleeing the area. There were no casualties from that attack.  ·Bangladeshi police shot dead two Islamist terrorists on Friday in a gunfight in Dhaka, including a prime suspect in the killing of 20 hostages, mostly foreigners, in a cafe in the capital last year. Nurul Islam Marjan, a commander of a splinter group of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), was killed along with another suspected terrorist, Saddam Hossain.  ·Elite Iraqi troops bridged a river under the cover of darkness to seize a district of Mosul in an unprecedented night raid early on Friday, part of a new phase in the battle to capture the city from ISIS after weeks of slowed momentum. Since last week, Iraqi forces have launched a renewed push to seize ground in the nearly three month-old offensive to capture the city, after progress stalled last month because of a need to slow the advance to protect civilians.  ·US-backed militias in Syria have captured an ancient citadel from ISIS in a strategically significant advance against the jihadist group in its stronghold of Raqqa province, a spokesman said on Friday. The Jabar citadel on the banks of Lake Assad was taken by the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance on Thursday, militia spokesman Talal Silo said. It is located near a dam on the Euphrates River that the US-backed alliance also aims to capture in the current phase of its campaign.  ·The Department of Defense announced yesterday that multiple airstrikes killed an estimated 20 or more al Qaeda “militants” in northern Syria at the beginning of the month. The results of the bombings are still being “assessed,” but US forces “struck two al Qaeda vehicles that had departed a large al Qaeda headquarters near Sarmada,” which is in the northern Idlib province, on January 1st. Then, on January 3rd, US forces “struck the headquarters compound itself, including multiple vehicles and structures.” Although the Defense Department doesn’t say it, the airstrikes were likely among the most significant carried out against al Qaeda facilities in Syria to date.  ·The State Department announced on Thursday that Osama bin Laden’s son, Hamza, has been added to the US government’s list of designated terrorists. State cites Hamza’s appearances in al Qaeda’s propaganda since Aug. 2015 as evidence of his important role in the organization. The junior bin Laden has called for terror attacks throughout the West, including inside the US, and he also encouraged “Saudi Arabian-based tribes to unite with” Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) “to wage war against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” Al Qaeda has released several messages from Hamza since mid-2015, but they have all been audio speeches. The terror organization has not published photos or video of Hamza as an adult, likely for security reasons.  ·Two car bombs in Baghdad claimed by ISIS killed at least 14 people on Thursday, police and medics said, part of a surge in violence across the capital. The first blast shook Baghdad's eastern al-Obeidi area during the morning rush, killing six and wounding 15. The second explosion hit the central district of Bab al-Moadham near a security checkpoint, killing eight.  ·The US has killed four mid-level ISIS commanders involved in military, suicide, chemical, and financial operations in airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria since the beginning of December 2016, the military announced over the past week.","link","http://poe.house.gov/index.cfm?p=terrorism-update","poe.house.gov",24,8,12,1,0,5,1,3

A statement from the interior ministry said the group had ties with commanders of the Sunni Islamist group in Syria, Iraq and Libya and had set up a hideout in the coastal town of El-Jadida. Morocco, a Western ally against Islamist terrorism, says that since 2002 it has dismantled more than 150 cells linked to jihadist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq.  ·A former Indonesian finance ministry official has been detained on his return home after being deported from Turkey for trying to cross into Syria on suspicion of intending to join ISIS, Indonesian authorities said on Friday. Police identified the man as Triyono Utomo and said he was detained along with his wife and three children after they arrived back in the Indonesian island of Bali.  ·On Thursday, just one day after executing a deadly suicide assault on a popular hotel in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu, al Shabaab announced that its religious courts executed “three spies.” One of the alleged spies was accused of working for the CIA to direct drone strikes on al Shabaab, al Qaeda’s branch in East Africa. Radio al Furqan, an al Shabaab radio station and media outlet, reported that the three spies were killed in the town of Yaaq Barawe in the Bay Region of southern Somalia.  ·Forces from France's Operation Barkhane have arrested three people in connection with a suicide bombing in northern Mali that killed at least 77 people, Mali's Security Minister Salif Traore said on Thursday. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb said five of its fighters conducted the attack on Jan. 18 on a military camp in the town of Gao that also wounded more than 100 people.  ·An upstate New York man was sentenced on Thursday to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, in connection with his alleged role in preparing a New Year's Eve attack in 2015 at a local club or bar. Emanuel Lutchman, 26, of Rochester, was sentenced by Chief Judge Frank Geraci of the federal court in that city, following his August 11 guilty plea, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The prison term was the maximum possible, and Lutchman was also sentenced to 50 years of supervised release.  ·A debate is under way in the Trump administration about whether the United States should declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and subject it to U.S. sanctions, according to U.S. officials and people close to President Donald Trump's transition team. A faction led by Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Advisor, wants to add the Brotherhood to the State Department and U.S. Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations, the sources said. Other Trump advisors, as well as some veteran national security, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence officials argue the Brotherhood has evolved peacefully in some countries.","link","http://poe.house.gov/index.cfm?p=terrorism-update","poe.house.gov",24,5,6,0,0,3,0,0

The man shouted Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) and rushed at police and soldiers before being shot near the museum's shopping mall, police said, adding a second person had also been detained after acting suspiciously. The attacker was alive but seriously wounded, the head of Paris police Michel Cadot told reporters at the scene, adding the bags he had been carrying contained no explosives.  · Warships shelled suspected al Qaeda strongholds in a mountainous region of southern Yemen on Thursday, government officials said. The officials said they believed U.S. forces carried out the operation, though Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis quickly denied any U.S. involvement. The strikes come less than a week after a covert U.S. Navy SEAL raid, also in Yemen's south, the first ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump as commander in chief.  · The U.N. envoy for Iraq says military operations to liberate Iraq from the Islamic State extremist group will be coming to an end ""in the rather short foreseeable future."" Jan Kubis told the U.N. Security Council Thursday that ""the days of the so-called ISIL are counted."" He said progress and the government's successful campaign to retake the eastern part of Mosul ""should not conceal that fighting has been and will be a massive challenge, in particular inside the old city in western Mosul.""  · U.S. President Donald Trump is poised to impose new sanctions on multiple Iranian entities, seeking to ratchet up pressure on Tehran while crafting a broader strategy to counter what he sees as its destabilizing behavior, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The new sanctions, which are being taken under existing executive orders covering terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, may mark the opening shot in a more aggressive policy against Iran that Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign.  · Faced with a diminishing number of fighters, ISIS is relying on retrofitted commercial drones to guide suicide car bombers to their targets and to launch small-scale airstrikes on Iraqi forces. The extremist group is spending freely on drone technology as it faces pressure from coalition forces, hacking store-bought machines, applying rigorous testing protocols and mimicking tactics used by U.S. unmanned aircraft. In all, a half-dozen storehouses ISIS used to make and modify drones have been found recently in Mosul, Iraqi military officials said.  · Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a powerful faction of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan (TTP), has released a video detailing a training camp somewhere in Pakistan’s northwest tribal frontier. The video also highlighted the training of suicide bombers and an assault on a Pakistani military base that took place last November.","link","http://poe.house.gov/terrorism-update?ID=24899E63-0B98-4A51-9B83-5A5B61E44BCC","poe.house.gov",43,43,20,1,0,7,10,5

A man believed to belong to ISIS blew himself up inside the Sayidati al-Jamila (""My Fair Lady"") restaurant at lunchtime, killing at least four people and wounding 15. The second attack was a suicide car-bomb that killed a soldier and wounded four others in the al-Nour district. Both districts were recently retaken from the terrorist group by U.S.-backed Iraqi forces. An explosive belt of the style usually worn by suicide bombers also blew up in a street of al-Zuhour without causing casualties.  ·A powerful Syrian jihadist group has made rapid gains against more moderate factions in northern Hama and southern Idlib provinces in recent days, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Friday. Jund al-Aqsa, which has had links with the al Qaeda’s branch in Syria, this week captured weapons and bases from groups operating under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner, and has detained dozens of rebel fighters.  ·ISIS fighters have shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya's political divisions after defeat in their former stronghold of Sirte, security officials say. The terrorists, believed to number several hundred and described as ""remnants"" of ISIS’ Libya operation, are trying to foment chaos by cutting power and water supplies and to identify receptive local communities, the officials said. They are being monitored through aerial surveillance and on-the-ground intelligence, but Libyan officials said they cannot easily be targeted without advanced air power.  ·Four people have been arrested in and around the southern French city of Montpellier on suspicion of planning an imminent terrorist attack in France, the interior ministry said on Friday. Police and judicial sources said those in custody included a 20-year-old man and his 16-year-old girlfriend, both known to authorities for connections with radical Islam, and said the attack had been due to take place in Paris. Police found TATP explosives and other bomb-making materials in the man's home.  ·Russia intervened to halt a clash between Syrian government forces and Turkey-backed Syrian rebels in northern Syria, sources on both sides said on Friday, the first confrontation between them as both sides fight ISIS in the area. ISIS is under attack from separate campaigns in northern Syria by Russian-backed government forces and Turkey-backed rebels. The clash on Thursday near the IS-held city of al-Bab underlined the risk of the parallel offensives igniting new fighting between the government and its rebel enemies. Russia and Turkey have backed opposing sides in the war but recently started cooperating over Syria, brokering a truce between government forces and rebels and working together to try to revive peace talks.  ·The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said on Thursday he needs several thousand more international troops in order to break a stalemate in the long war with Taliban insurgents, signaling the matter may soon be put before President Donald Trump. So far, the Trump administration has offered little clarity about the possibility of more forces in Afghanistan, where some 8,400 U.S. troops remain more than 15 years after the Islamist Taliban government was toppled by U.S.-backed Afghan forces. A U.S. soldier was severely wounded in fighting in Afghanistan on Thursday, and  Army General John Nicholson, who leads U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, acknowledged Taliban gains over the past year, when deployed U.S. forces were reduced even as security deteriorated.  ·Fareed Mumuni, a 22 year-old man from New York City, admitted on Thursday that he had sought to provide support to ISIS and tried to kill an FBI agent with a knife when authorities came to his home to execute a search warrant in 2015. He was one of six young men in New York and New Jersey charged in a probe into what Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Solomon called a ""group of like-minded individuals who had pledged allegiance to ISIL.”  ·The head of a new alliance of Syrian Islamist factions, including an al Qaeda affiliate, has promised to escalate attacks against the Syrian army and its Iranian-backed allies with the goal of toppling President Bashar al-Assad. Hashem al-Sheikh, leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was formed last month, also said in his first video speech that the new grouping sought to ""liberate"" all of Syria's territory.  ·Katibat Imam al Bukhari, also known as the Imam Bukhari Jamaat, has claimed an ambush on Afghan troops in northern Afghanistan in a statement released through the terrorist group’s Telegram channel. The statement did not specify the Afghan province where the attack occurred. According to the statement, KIB jihadists destroyed three Afghan humvees in improvised explosive device (IED) blast before opening fire on soldiers. Additionally, the group claimed to kill four Afghan troops. Pictures showing the explosions and subsequent ambush were released alongside the statement.  ·ISIS has claimed Wednesday’s suicide assault on a hotel in the northern Somali town of Bosaso in a statement released online. The attack left at least four security guards and at least two gunmen dead. According to local media, militants affiliated with the Islamic State faction operating in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland stormed the Village Hotel in Bosaso. This prompted a fierce shootout between the militants and the hotel’s security guards, with four guards and at least two gunmen dying.","link","http://poe.house.gov/terrorism-update","poe.house.gov",60,24,39,0,0,9,3,1

The bombing took place outside Maiduguri, the population center at the heart of a government campaign to eradicate the Islamist group, whose more than seven-year insurgency has killed 15,000 people and forced some two million from their homes. The Borno State Emergency Management Agency said eight members of a local militia, the civilian Joint Task Force, were wounded in the attack.  ·Pakistani security forces killed dozens of suspected militants on Friday, a day after ISIS claimed a suicide bombing that killed more than 80 worshippers at a Sufi shrine in the latest of a series of attacks across the country. The bombing at the famed Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine in southern Sindh province was Pakistan's deadliest attack in two years, killing at least 83 people and underlining the threat of terrorist groups like the Pakistani Taliban and ISIS.  ·ISIS fighters are developing a network of passageways and tunnels in the narrow alleys of west Mosul that will enable them to hide and fight among the civilian population when Iraqi forces launch an attack that is expected any day now. Residents said the fighters have been opening passages in the walls between houses to allow them to move from block to block undetected, disappear after hit-and-run operations and track government troop movements. They have also opened sniper holes in buildings overlooking the Tigris river bisecting the city into east and west.  ·Turkey's military said on Friday it was close to taking Syria's al-Bab from ISIS, but a war monitor said the jihadists still controlled 90 percent of the town itself and that shelling and air strikes had killed dozens of civilians in recent days. Al-Bab, an ISIS stronghold 20 miles from the Turkish border, has been a prime target since Turkey launched an incursion last August to push the jihadists from its frontier and prevent gains by a Kurdish militia also fighting them. Taking control of the town would deepen Turkish influence in an area of Syria where it has already effectively created a buffer zone and allow Turkish forces to press on towards Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria.  ·The government of the restive far-western Xinjiang marched thousands of armed officers through the region's southern city of Hotan in a shock and awe campaign against what it says is the rising threat of terrorism and ethnic separatism. The large-scale parade in Hotan, a hotspot of ethnic tension in Xinjiang's southern Muslim Uighur heartland, involved thousands of armed police and paramilitary officers and was designed to ""show strength and intimidate"", according to a front-page report in the official Xinjiang Daily on Friday.  ·U.S. and coalition military forces continued to attack ISIS conducting 15 strikes consisting of 19 engagements in Syria and nine strikes consisting of 16 engagements in Iraq.","link","http://poe.house.gov/index.cfm?p=terrorism-update&id=774C8CBB-86AE-4529-95C0-77C722DB3BE2","poe.house.gov",29,25,16,0,0,2,6,1

The ICRC ""condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons during fighting around the Iraqi city of Mosul"", it said in a statement.  ·Rival Kurdish groups clashed in Iraq's northwestern Sinjar region on Friday, two Kurdish security sources said. The deadly fighting erupted when Peshmerga Rojava forces moved towards the border with Syria, encroaching on territory controlled by a local affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The unrest highlights the risk of conflict and turf war between the multiple forces arrayed against ISIS, many of which lean on regional patrons for political support and arms.  ·The Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday that Russian military advisers had planned and overseen the Syrian army's recapture of the city of Palmyra and that Russian warplanes and special forces had played a decisive role. The Syrian army said on Thursday it had retaken the ancient city from ISIS for the second time in a year, with help from allied forces.  ·Bangladeshi police have arrested the head of an Islamist terrorist group accused of inspiring followers to kill foreigners, the chief of the counter-terrorism unit said on Friday. Shaikh Mohammad Abul Kashem, who founded an offshoot of the larger Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) group, was picked up on Thursday night in the Senpara Parbata area of the capital, Dhaka. Kashem worked alongside Canadian citizen Tamim Chowdhury and Nurul Islam Marjan, two men police accused of masterminding an attack on an upscale Dhaka cafe in July in which 22 people were killed, most of them foreigners.  ·Residents in Yemen said U.S. soldiers fought two separate gun battles with al Qaeda overnight on Friday, supported by heavy aerial bombardment. If confirmed, it would be the first time Washington has deployed ground troops in the country since a Navy Seal was killed in a similar operation on January 29.  Just a day earlier, the United States said it carried out more than 20 precision strikes in Yemen targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula on Thursday, in the first major operations against the group since a January raid by U.S. commandos. The Pentagon said the strikes targeted al Qaeda fighters, heavy weapons systems, equipment, infrastructure and the group's fighting positions. They were carried out in the Yemeni governorates of Abyan, Al Bayda and Shabwah.  ·Mali's main jihadist groups said on Thursday they will merge under Islamist leader Iyad Ag-Ghali whose fighters have claimed multiple attacks on Malian, French and U.N. peacekeeping forces, Mauritania's Nouakchott News Agency (ANI) reported. ANI said Ag-Ghali's Ansar Dine would join with al-Mourabitoun, led by Algerian jihadist and smuggler Mokhtar Belmokhtar, which claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack on a military camp in northern Mali that killed up to 60 people and wounded more than 100 in January.  ·Brussels police detained a man with suspected terrorist links who was found to be carrying two gas cylinders in his car after he was pulled over on Thursday for running a red light, officials said. After checks were conducted on the vehicle, prosecutors said that one of the cylinders was empty, and no explosive or mechanism of detonation was found in the car.  ·Kenya said its forces had killed 57 Islamist al Shabaab terrorists in a battle in southern Somalia on Wednesday, but the group denied any of its fighters had died in the clash. Kenyan troops under the African Union command used artillery and helicopter gunships against the Islamists in Afmadow, a town about 60 miles inland from the port of Kismayu, Kenyan military spokesman Col. Joseph Owuoth said in a statement.  ·On Wednesday the Taliban rejected US General John Nicholson’s call for reconciliation after a press release announcing the death of Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban’s shadow emir for Kunduz province. US, European, and Afghan officials had been urging the Taliban to reconcile for well over a decade. But the Taliban had proven unwilling to negotiate a peace deal and join the government, even after suffering setbacks. In his response the Taliban spokesman, Zabihulllah Mujahid, said that the Taliban would fight until NATO forces withdraw from Afghanistan and “accept the lawful demands of the valiant Afghan,” which means the return of a Taliban government.","link","http://poe.house.gov/index.cfm?p=terrorism-update&id=3316FC21-3AF3-4F89-810C-EEBE60A85009","poe.house.gov",17,27,10,1,0,0,4,3

The Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group has announced on its affiliated online media outlets that it killed several soldiers from Ethiopian forces stationed at the city's airport. Local residents said there has been a heavy exchange of gunfire between the attackers and Ethiopian troops serving under AMISOM. AMISOM, however did not comment on the airport, which is housing hundreds of Ethiopian troops.  ·The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) announced on Thursday the arrest of a suspected Palestinian Hezbollah operative who was allegedly instructed to carry out terror attacks against Israelis as well as kidnap Israeli civilians. The suspect, Yusef Yasser Suylam, a 23-year-old based in the Palestinian West Bank town of Qalqiliya, was recently arrested in a joint Shin Bet, Israel Police and IDF operation. Following his arrest, the Shin Bet interrogated Suylam and discovered that Hezbollah had recruited him through social media, luring the young man to join their ranks through a Facebook profile the Shi'ite terror organization regularly uses to track potential recruits.  ·A new U.S. strategy to break a stalemate in Afghanistan will require additional American troops, the head of the U.S. Central Command said on Thursday."" I do believe it will involve additional forces to ensure that we can make the advise and assist mission more effective,"" Army General Joseph Votel said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Vogel also said as many as 12 civilians died in a raid against al Qaeda in Yemen in late January, the head of the U.S. military's Central Command said on Thursday.  ·U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will host a 68-nation meeting in Washington this month to discuss the next moves by a coalition fighting ISIS, the State Department said on Thursday. The March 22-23 meeting of coalition foreign ministers aimed ""to accelerate international efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it holds in Iraq and Syria and maximize pressure on its branches, affiliates, and networks,"" the State Department said in a statement.  ·Iraqi forces aim to dislodge ISIS fighters from west Mosul within a month, despite grueling urban combat in densely populated terrain, the head of the elite Counter Terrorism Service said on Thursday. As Iraqi forces advance deeper into west Mosul, they are facing increasingly stiff resistance from ISIS using suicide car bombs and snipers to defend their last major stronghold in Iraq.  ·Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney urged Iraq and the world’s nations on Thursday not to let ISIS “get away with genocide.” Clooney, who represents victims of ISIS rapes and kidnappings, told a U.N. meeting that what’s “shocking” is not just the group’s brutality but the “passive” response by the world’s nations to the campaign to investigate its crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice. She urged Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to send a letter to the U.N. Security Council so it can vote to set up an investigation into crimes by the group in Iraq where ISIS once controlled about 40 percent of the country’s territory.  ·Yemen's local al Qaeda wing appealed for help on Thursday to fend off an offensive by the armed Houthi movement in central Yemen, and accused the United States of coordinating attacks with the Iran-aligned group, according to an online statement.

The blast, 50 yards from the base, was heard several miles away and damaged several shops, homes and a school. In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had caused heavy casualties however; the terrorist group often exaggerates casualties caused by its operations.  · Iraqi forces battling ISIS in Mosul advanced into the Old City and around the al Nuri mosque on Friday trying to seal off a main road to prevent terrorists sending in suicide bombers. Troops are meeting fierce resistance as terrorists retreat into the Old City, where street fighting is expected in the narrow alleyways and around the mosque where ISIS declared its caliphate nearly three years ago.  · The Israeli military said it shot down one of numerous anti-aircraft missiles launched on Friday at its air force which was operating in Syria, in a rare such incident that spilled over into neighboring countries. The Syrian army said it had shot down an Israeli jet during the operation. Israel denied this, saying that all its aircraft had returned unscathed.  · A Saudi Arabia-born man was convicted on Thursday of participating in a 2003 attack in Afghanistan that killed two U.S. servicemen and plotting to bomb a U.S. embassy in West Africa, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said. A jury found Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Adam Harun, known by the nom de guerre Spin Ghul, guilty of all counts after only two hours of deliberations. The al Qaeda operative faces life in prison at his sentencing.  · A female employee of the International Monetary Fund suffered injuries to her face and arms on Thursday when a letter bomb mailed from Greece and addressed to the world lender's European representative blew up as she opened it, officials said. Paris anti-terrorism prosecutors opened an investigation and although a terrorist Greek group, Conspiracy of Fire Cells, claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb mailed to Germany’s Finance Minister on Wednesday, but there was no immediate claim for the Paris attack.  · The Somali terrorist group, al Shabaab, is letting civilians in drought-hit regions under their control move with relative freedom to find food, the group and a U.N. official said on Thursday, but they are continuing to restrict the access of international aid groups. Somalia, struggling to recover from more than 25 years of civil war and an ongoing battle between its U.N.-backed government and Islamist insurgents, could sink into famine if the April rains fail.  · Warplanes struck a mosque in the rebel-held village of al-Jina, in northwest Syria, killing at least 42 people and wounding dozens, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said on Thursday.  · An air strike carried out by U.S. forces on Thursday in Idlib, Syria, killed several al Qaeda militants, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. ""Idlib has been a significant safe haven for al Qaeda in recent years,"" the statement said, making no mention of civilian casualties.  · U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis met with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday and they discussed U.S.-Saudi military cooperation in the fight against ISIS, the Pentagon said in a statement. Mattis and Prince Mohammed, who is the kingdom's defense minister, also discussed ""confronting Iran's destabilizing regional activities.""","link","http://poe.house.gov/index.cfm?p=terrorism-update&id=343C572A-5E81-4E37-A010-489E6D2E6238","poe.house.gov",31,142,6,0,1,0,0,3

The explosion in a remote area bordering Afghanistan came as people gathered for Friday prayers near the women's entrance of a Shia mosque in the central bazaar, the latest in a series of attacks across Sunni-majority Pakistan this year.  Three suspected al Qaeda members were killed overnight in what local officials believed was a U.S. drone strike in southern Yemen. Residents and local officials said on Friday the attack took place in Mozno in al-Wadie district of Abyan province. The three killed included the local leader of the terrorist group, Waddah Muhammed Amsouda, who was meeting the others in a house in the area. Abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern Yemen where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its local affiliate Ansar al-Sharia operate.  Kenya has arrested a suspected ISIS terrorist on the country's ""most wanted"" list who allegedly helped send recruits to Libya and Somalia, police said on Thursday. Police seized Ali Hussein Ali, who is nicknamed ""Trusted One"", and two accomplices in the coastal town of Malindi on Monday. In a statement, the police said Ali had helped smuggle recruits to ISIS in Libya where he has ties with a human trafficking ring, and to the al Shabaab terrorist group in Somalia. He also moved money around East Africa and beyond for ISIS, police said.  Anjem Choudary, a high-profile British Islamist preacher who was sentenced to prison last year for inviting support for ISIS terrorism, was added to the U.S. global counter-terrorism list, the U.S. Treasury said on Thursday. Choudary was one of seven people added to the list, which blocks their assets in the United States and prohibits U.S. citizens from dealing with them.  A former violent criminal who converted to Islam and kept out of trouble for more than a decade, the killer who struck Britain's parliament last week was probably a ""lone wolf"", self-radicalized by material on the internet, investigators say. Police say Khalid Masood, who tried to put his troubled past behind him by turning to religion, had copied the low cost, low tech attacks espoused by ISIS, but investigators have found nothing yet to link him to extremist groups at home or terrorists abroad.  German prosecutors have charged an Afghan citizen with being a member of the Taliban and an accessory to attempted murder by taking part in armed attacks by insurgents against policemen in Afghanistan. The Federal Prosecutor's Office (GBA) said in a statement on Thursday that 21-year-old Hekmat T. received military training by the Taliban after he joined the militant group in mid-2013 and took part in four attacks against policemen.  Germany has deported 10 potential attackers since January as part of a tougher approach toward failed asylum seekers and other foreigners it deems dangerous after one of them killed 12 people at a Berlin market, security sources said on Thursday. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and other top officials have been pushing for quicker deportations of those denied asylum, while working with Morocco, Tunisia and other countries to speed up the repatriation process.  ISIS claimed responsibility on Thursday for two suicide attacks that killed at least 31 people in Damascus on March 15. The group made the claim in its weekly online newspaper al-Nabaa. The newspaper said the two suicide bombers, identified by the group as Abu Musa al Golani and Abu Firas al Shami, had killed and injured over one hundred people in two separate attacks. The first attack was on a courthouse in central Damascus near the Old City and the second struck a popular restaurant in the al-Rabweh area of the capital. As many as eight militants have blown themselves up with a grenade north of the Bangladeshi capital rather than surrender to officers who had cornered them in their hideout, police said on Thursday. Police urged the militants in Nasirpur, northeast of the capital Dhaka, to give themselves up on Wednesday, but instead they detonated the grenade.","link","http://poe.house.gov/terrorism-update?ID=37B963D2-4EE7-4E0C-BE64-E5FE0ECD5AA5","poe.house.gov",23,18,17,0,0,1,1,7

In the years since, the Affordable Care Act has failed and imploded faster than anyone ever imagined. Skyrocketing premiums, lower quality of care and job killing regulations are just a few of the ways Obamacare has burdened individuals and businesses. This law is not sustainable, and doing nothing is not an option, so today we voted to repeal the failing Obamacare system and replace it with one that offers affordable, quality care. This repeal and replace legislation is a step in the right direction with further administrative reforms and separate legislation also needed down the road.  I supported the bill for a number of reasons:  For starters, this bill helps to make premiums affordable for everyone by providing tax credits. Texas has the highest number of uninsured Americans of any state in the nation. Millions of Texans lack health insurance because they either can’t afford to purchase it or they are not covered by an employer. This legislation provides the uninsured with an opportunity to buy health insurance in an affordable way with tax credits if they choose to do so This bill also sets aside $85 billion dollars for the purpose of providing tax credits for Americans over 50 who are not insured by an employer or on Medicaid to help them buy insurance that they may not be able to afford otherwise.     The American Health Care Act empowers individuals to make their own decision on whether or not they want to purchase health insurance. In my opinion, the individual mandate is unconstitutional. This bill removes that. Furthermore, it eliminates the employer mandate, which required employers to purchase health insurance for their workers or pay a penalty and which has forced businesses to not create new jobs, fire employees, or even close their doors.  Contrary to the heated, false rhetoric, this bill protects Americans with pre-existing conditions by ensuring that health insurers cannot deny coverage to people solely because of a pre-existing condition. As a cancer patient myself, I know the importance of this, and I know how important it is for the 27% of Americans with preexisting conditions.  The bill also includes a provision that prevents insurance companies from charging higher premiums to individuals based on the fact that they have a pre-existing condition.  The legislation permits states to apply for a waiver of this prohibition through the Department of Health and Human Services, but only if the state has chosen to offer another coverage option, like risk-sharing pools or reinsurance. No matter what: no person can be charged more money based on a pre-existing condition if they maintain continuous insurance coverage. In fact, the legislation allocates $138 billion for risk-sharing programs which help protect those with preexisting conditions.  It also allows young Americans under age 26 to stay on their parents’ insurance plans.  Under Obamacare, the federal government seized the power to determine the ten essential health benefits that insurance companies were mandated to cover. This bill transfers that power to the states, who can apply for an exemption to these mandates if they have a high-risk insurance pool to help ensure coverage for their citizens. It also provides $15 billion in safeguards to cover coverage costs for mental health care, substance abuse, and/or maternity care.   The bill defunds Planned Parenthood and redirects $500 million to community health centers, which are spread across our district and the nation. These centers provide important women’s health and cancer screenings. The bill also expands tax-free health care savings accounts for those with high-deductible insurance plans. It doubles the amount that individuals can contribute to their accounts.  This bill gives Americans the choice over whether or not they buy health care, and it provides extensive resources and financial incentives for them to be able to do so.  Obamacare has failed; it is time for a new path forward driven by individuals and their doctors, not politicians in Washington. This bill is the first step forward on that path.”","status",NA,NA,299,296,148,19,0,4,12,165

Hodgkinson of Illinois opened fire at the Republican team’s practice for the congressional baseball game, a nearly 100 year old bipartisan charity event that raises hundreds of thousands of dollars. This attack was deliberate, and Republican Members of Congress and their staffs were the targets. Five people were wounded: Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Zachary Barth with Rep. Roger Williams (TX-25), Matt Mika, Special Agent David Bailey, and Special Agent Crystal Greiner. If it wasn’t for the Capitol Police Officers who were at the baseball practice as part of Whip Scalise’s security detail, many lives could have been lost today. Those officers are heroes. I commend the Capitol Police Department, Alexandria Police Department, and first responders who helped treat the wounded, and I am grateful for their service. I continue to pray for the swift recovery of those wounded this morning.  No Member of Congress will be deterred from their service to this nation because of this morning’s attack. We need to put the hostile and inflammatory rhetoric aside and debate issues in a civil manner. We all stand united in shock and horror, but we are united to continue our service to this nation that we all love.","status",NA,NA,456,76,90,33,0,5,84,8

Those in the Pakistani military and intelligence services who thought they could keep betraying the United States while accepting billions in aid from Washington must now realize that the jig is up. For years I have championed a tougher line on Pakistan in Congress precisely for the reasons the President laid out in his speech: Pakistan supports terrorist groups of all stripes operating inside Afghanistan, providing them with money, arms, and logistical support. Despite Pakistan’s ongoing treachery, Islamabad is among the leading recipients of U.S. foreign assistance since 9/11 and is praised in some quarters of the U.S. government as a “vital” ally. This must stop – if we want to stabilize Afghanistan, we must deal first with Pakistan.  President Trump’s speech marked a positive shift in U.S. policy, but it must not be limited only to words. If Pakistan does not stop aiding terrorists with American blood on their hands we must cut all aid to Islamabad, revoke their privileged status as a Major Non-NATO ally, and designate Pakistan a State Sponsor of Terrorism.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has more than 400 Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) personnel working to save lives in south Texas. Another 500-plus personnel are in the state and are expected to be performing rescues this evening.  National US&R teams, located across the United States, are trained and equipped to handle structural collapses and swift water rescues.  State and local officials are asking those in the impacted area to please remember:  -Stay calm, do not panic. -Do not go into your attic – rescuers from the air cannot see you. -Safely seek higher ground if able to do so; get to a safe place. -Safely mark your roof to be seen by the air. To get rescuers’ attention, wave sheets, towels etc.  If you feel your life is in danger, call 911. First responders are not responding to requests for assistance received through social media, so if you cannot get through to 911 at first, keep calling.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has also stated that if you are in need of immediate rescue you can call them at the following numbers:  281-464-4851 281-464-4852 281-464-4853 281-464-4854 281-464-4855  The Coast Guard has over 420 personnel conducting operations in south Texas, with 16 helicopters in the air and 8 more inbound.

You can even claim the loss on your 2016 tax return to get more immediate relief. If you already filed for 2016, you can amend the return to claim the loss.  If you choose to claim a loss: Document everything and take many pictures! Every item lost must be documented.   Get appraisals as soon as possible. You will need to know the value of the property immediately before the disaster and the value immediately after. You can deduct the fee for the appraisal!  Document the original cost of the property (your basis).  Insurance proceeds and reimbursements are subtracted from the amount of loss, so keep good records of any proceeds.  You can find more information about claiming casualty losses here:https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p547.pdf.

We must work towards immediate recovery, address maintenance of current infrastructure and plan for future flood mitigation.   We agreed that we must remove debris from existing lakes and rivers. Then build at least one more reservoir to protect the flooded areas on the west side and the areas downstream from lake Conroe. This original plan dates back to the 1930’s. Engineers reiterated the need for this third reservoir again during the 1940’s. An additional reservoir would allow flood waters to be stored, alleviating the need for unplanned water releases that we experienced during Hurricane Harvey.   Other viable ideas have been presented, such as creating underground reservoirs for the storage and reuse of flood water turned treated, potable water.  We discussed the dredging and debris removal from existing lakes and the San Jacinto River, which could be done by private companies who want to reuse the sand (as payment for the dredging).

He fled the scene, sending bystanders into a panicked frenzy until peace officers apprehended the radical Islamic terrorist. Just blocks from the World Trade center, 8 individuals lay dead and at least 13 more were injured.   We must not allow terror to strike fear on American soil.

Meanwhile, the United States does not have a whole of government approach to combatting terrorism on the cyber battlefield.

Ever resilient, we rallied together and began the process of rebuilding our homes and our lives. Today, Congress took another step forward in helping those affected by the treacherous floodwaters. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act, passed today by the House, helps reform the floundering National Flood Insurance Program by injecting private market competition and pragmatic reforms.   Most importantly for Houston, the legislation requires funding to be prioritized for properties that have experienced repetitive flood losses and improves mapping technology so that policies are based on more accurate information and data. The passage of this legislation will help Texas with the recovery process and works to improve already existing flood protections. I urge the Senate to move quickly on this bill.

Brian Babin, Michael McCaul, Rep. Kevin Brady and I released the following statement regarding the Office of Management and Budget Supplemental Disaster Request.  “After reviewing the latest Office of Management and Budget (OMB) supplemental request for disaster recovery, we find the proposal insufficient and unacceptable. We have met personally with the Director of OMB and explained in detail the disaster of Harvey on Texas. Even so, we strongly believe the request is woefully inadequate. Hurricane Harvey and the subsequent flooding events that followed ranks as the second most costly disaster in modern times (the Fukushima Disaster ranks first). While damages are still being determined, estimates currently sit at approximately $190 billion or more.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act creates a simpler and fairer tax code, giving relief to middle income Americans. It also lowers the corporate tax rate to 21%, which is currently one of the highest in the world. This will help make our country more competitive, create more jobs, and increase paychecks.   A typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:  ✔️Simplifies an outdated tax code and promotes domestic and global economic competitiveness. ✔️Increases the standard deduction by nearly double ($12,700 for individuals and $24,400 for joint filers. That money is not taxed at all). ✔️Lowers tax rates across the board.  ✔️Expands the child tax credit to $2,000, giving parents more money to help raise their families. ✔️Lowers the corporate tax rate to 21%. This means real tax relief to small business job creators. ✔️Eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax, allowing Americans to buy the health care that is right for them, if they choose to.  ✔️Supports graduate students by continuing to exempt the value of reduced tuition from taxes.  ✔️Increases the exemption amount from the Alternative Minimum Tax.   ✔️Reforms the Death Tax by doubling the amount of the current exemption.
