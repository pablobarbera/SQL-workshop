After two years and a Republican entering the White House eager to work with us, the 115th Congress has finally begun the process of repealing and replacing the ill-advised law.   The Senate took the first steps recently by passing a repeal resolution, a necessary component that will allow us to repeal the law later this year by a simple majority vote. Meanwhile, the Senate continues to work on a replacement that is affordable, market-driven and truly centered around the patient. These are the fundamental principles that Obamacare has failed to deliver to the American people.   As the repeal timeline is established, there will be a transition period before its replacement is fully implemented. We recognize the need to protect healthcare benefits during this transition. There is agreement that continuation of coverage is an important part of any replacement plan. We anticipate that there will be many options made available for health care design and coverages through this replacement legislation. However, all will include a guaranteed renewal of coverage, portability of coverage and children remaining on their families’ plans until the age of 26.  Since the partisan law was enacted seven years ago, Americans have been painfully aware of its shortcomings. Supporters of the law promised that premiums would go down. Instead, they continue to skyrocket, increasing 37 percent in South Dakota this year alone. Supporters also promised that those who liked their coverage could keep it, yet since the ACA was enacted nearly 5 million Americans lost the health care plans they enjoyed.   Americans are also left with fewer health care options when seeking coverage. Because insurers are losing so much money on Obamacare, many have left the marketplace altogether. Over half of the Obamacare co-ops have already failed. South Dakota is one of nine states which have only two health care providers offering insurance plans on the exchange. Five more states have only one provider in their state, a dramatic decrease from the pre-Obamacare era.   Countless South Dakotans have contacted my office to share their problems with Obamacare. One father of three from Rapid City wrote me recently to explain that his family’s premium was rising 357 percent for 2017. “I do not know what my next year will bring,” he wrote, “but I do know that I will likely be unable to afford my premiums or my needed health care.”   Another gentleman, from Sioux Falls, is facing a 47 percent increase in his premium this year, on top of an increase in copays and the deductible. A South Dakota veteran also wrote asking Congress to provide Obamacare relief to small business owners after seeing his premium more than double from $800 a month to more than $1,600 between 2014 and 2016. Hard-working, middle-class South Dakotans “are falling through the cracks,” he pleaded. I couldn’t agree more.   Since the law was being debated in 2009, I have warned that Obamacare is unaffordable and unsustainable, and that it would eventually crumble under its own weight. That is what we are seeing today, and that is why the 115th Congress acted swiftly to begin the process to repeal it. As we continue the march toward repeal, we will also work on a replacement that is truly affordable, patient-centered and market-based.","link","http://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-repealing-obamacare-first-step-toward-replacing-it-with-a-truly-affordable-patient-centered-plan","rounds.senate.gov",32,32,2,0,0,0,0,9

At noon on January 20, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump becomes President Donald Trump, after he is administered the oath of office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  The oath of office of the President of the United States is only 35 words long, and is stated in the United States Constitution: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” The first president to take the presidential oath was George Washington at his inauguration on April 30, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York City, the temporary seat of government at that time.  President Washington also set the precedent of delivering an inaugural address following his swearing-in ceremony, a tradition that has led to some of the most renowned quotes from our presidents. Washington swore to preserve “the sacred fire of liberty” and uphold the “Republican model of Government.” Other famous lines from inaugural addresses include John F. Kennedy’s “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,” and Ronald Reagan’s “In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” These remarks continue to inspire Americans today.  The entire ceremony takes place on the West Front Lawn of the U.S. Capitol, as it has since 1981. Attendees fill the National Mall from the Capitol steps to the Washington Monument, all to catch a glimpse of living history. Following the swearing-in and inaugural address, an inaugural parade and numerous balls take place throughout Washington, D.C.  While January 20th is the official day the president takes office, months of preparation have gone into the planning of the inauguration ceremony and official events, such as the parade and the formal balls. Since 1901, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has been in charge of setting up the swearing-in ceremonies. Thousands of men and women have been working behind the scenes to plan the ceremony and make sure the Capitol remains secure. I’d like to thank them for their hard work, as well as all the members of the law enforcement community who have been putting in long hours leading up to inauguration weekend. Their job protecting the attendees at the inauguration is incredibly difficult, and their dedication to the security of the attendees is deserving of praise. Without their commitment, this very special day for our nation could not run as effortlessly and with the dignity it deserves.    In his inaugural speech, Thomas Jefferson said, “But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle…We are all republicans. We are all federalists.” His wise words ring true today. Though we may disagree with one another on certain policies, we are all Americans, and our presidential inaugurations reflect a decidedly American ideal: the peaceful transition of power from one administration to the next.","link","http://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-a-peaceful-transition-of-power","rounds.senate.gov",37,1,2,1,0,0,0,1

Justice Scalia was one of the strongest defenders of the Constitution who fought fiercely against judicial activism and legislating from the bench. Replacing him will be extremely difficult, and is of the utmost importance, as Supreme Court Justices can dramatically alter the course of our nation in just one vote.   President Trump has made an excellent choice in nominating Judge Gorsuch to replace Justice Scalia on the bench. An avid outdoorsman, Judge Gorsuch was born in Colorado, educated at Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, and for the past 10 years has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver. He has previously clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. Throughout his career, he has a clear record of following the Constitution as it was written and following the rule of law.  We believe Judge Gorsuch espouses the same approach as Justice Scalia and has a strong understanding of federalism upon which our country is built.   In our federal system, the Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the country and has ultimate jurisdiction over all federal courts. Because the current makeup of the court is evenly split between conservative and liberal-leaning justices, filling this 9th spot is as important as ever. This next justice has the potential to hold incredible influence over the ideological direction of the court for a generation to come.  The Supreme Court is the final authority for interpreting federal laws and the Constitution. It is one of the most important responsibilities in our federal system.   That is why the decision was made early on by Leader McConnell and others to give the American people a voice in the process of replacing Justice Scalia, by waiting to confirm the next Justice until the 45th President was in office and able to nominate someone him or herself.  We held that belief even when it looked like our party would not win the presidency. But as we have been reminded, elections have consequences. The American people chose to elect President Trump, who throughout his campaign said that he would nominate someone “in the mold of the late Justice Scalia.”  President Trump made good on fulfilling that promise when he nominated Judge Gorsuch to the Court. Judge Gorsuch is greatly respected on both sides of the aisle. In fact, he was previously confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit unanimously – with not a single Republican or Democrat member of the Senate dissenting. Nearly a dozen Democrat Senators who did not oppose his nomination in 2006 still serve in the Senate today, including Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Diane Feinstein and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.   As such, we expect the Senate will continue its tradition of approving highly competent, qualified individuals to the Supreme Court in an up or down vote following a thorough vetting process. We owe it to the late Justice Scalia, our judicial system, the Constitution and every American to see his confirmation through.","status",NA,NA,39,40,4,3,0,0,0,6

Most recently I introduced two pieces of legislation that seek to ease the regulatory burden on banks and other financial institutions, so they can more easily provide loans and other services to South Dakotans.  Many of the regulations hindering our financial institutions today are a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill. Dodd-Frank was an ill-advised attempt to correct the mistakes of the 2008 recession and collapse of the housing market. Unfortunately, the end result was more than 2,300 pages of new rules and regulations on our local banks and credit unions, despite having nothing to do with the housing collapse.  I recently reintroduced the Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk (TAILOR) Act to correct Dodd-Franks “one-size-fits-all” approach to regulating. The TAILOR Act would ease the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions by requiring regulatory agencies to take into consideration the risk profile and business models of individual financial institutions and tailor those regulations accordingly. Additionally, it requires the regulatory agencies to provide an annual report to Congress outlining the steps they have taken to tailor their regulations. This will allow the local banks and credit unions to focus their resources on taking care of their customers, rather than spending time and money on compliance, the costs of which are ultimately passed onto the consumer in South Dakota.  I also recently introduced legislation that would dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB, a product of Dodd-Frank, is yet another regulatory agency with the power to promulgate sweeping new rules on financial institutions, the cost of which has been handed down to families looking to do business with their local banks and credit unions. Even more alarming, the CFPB is an unchecked, unaccountable regulatory agency with no oversight from Congress. My bill would bar the transfer of funds from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to the CFPB. The bill also requires the CFPB to turn over all penalty funding and other money it has received to the Treasury.  As a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, one of my top priorities has been to provide regulatory relief to financial institutions so that South Dakota families can have better access to loans and capital – capital that can be used to purchase a home, buy a new car or invest in a new business that will bring economic activity to our state. I will continue to seek policies that allow our financial institutions to better serve their customers and strengthen our communities.","status",NA,NA,28,49,0,0,1,0,2,13

It was recently announced that I will have the opportunity to again be the chairman of the Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Management and Regulatory Oversight during this next session of Congress. I’m looking forward to building upon the work we have done to advance meaningful regulatory reform that will benefit our economy while simultaneously preserving our natural resources.   Our subcommittee is tasked with overseeing the rulemaking processes at agencies like the EPA and Army Corps. We will continue to hold hearings, as we did during the past two years, to make sure these agencies are using sound science and taking into account economic, state, and local concerns when issuing any new regulations. Under the Obama administration, we too often saw regulatory agencies fail to adequately consult with local units of government and other stakeholders before issuing regulations that directly impact their livelihoods. We will also continue to oversee the Army Corps’ management of the Missouri River and work with them to avoid another devastating flood event like the flood of 2011. We held a field hearing on the 2011 flood during the last Congress where it was revealed that there is room for improvement within the Army Corps to make certain they manage the Missouri River in an appropriate and responsible manner.   At a subcommittee field hearing during the last Congress, we heard from South Dakotans about the negative impact of one of these rules, the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule, which would give the EPA unprecedented authority over significant water bodies that it currently does not have jurisdiction over. The rule would create new barriers for not just the ag community but landowners and local leaders who simply want to keep weeds from growing along our roads and ditches. Yet, our committee found that EPA continuously ignored the concerns of farmers, ranchers, agriculture groups, state governors, attorneys general and the Small Business Administration before moving ahead with the WOTUS rule. Despite these concerns and a nationwide court stay against the rule, the previous administration also illegally worked to implement it.   Fortunately, President Trump’s newly-confirmed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt intends to turn a new page at the EPA. Administrator Pruitt is committed to working diligently to restore order at the agency, promising to consult with state and local leaders when making decisions, using only the most current, sound science and – importantly – working with Congress before making any sweeping regulatory changes. This is a breath of fresh air for many farmers, ranchers, local leaders and landowners across the state.   The success of the U.S. economy and the creation of American jobs depends on Congress making a concerted effort to take back their authority and reign in the rulemaking process, and the EPW oversight subcommittee is ready to take on that task. We will continue to conduct a thorough review of the regulatory process at the EPA, Army Corps, and other agencies. And when we see areas that need fixing, we will work with them to find solutions that take both our economy and the environment into consideration.   We all want clean air and water, and I believe we can achieve that without imposing excessive regulations on the American people. I look forward to working with EPW Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), other members of my subcommittee and the new administration to explore further ways to hold regulatory agencies accountable to the public.","link","http://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/rounds-weekly-column-advancing-regulatory-reform-through-epw-subcommittee","rounds.senate.gov",16,19,2,0,0,0,0,4

But we also spend a great deal of time helping South Dakotans who are having difficulties dealing with a federal agency. It is a lesser-known but equally-important service that allows us to act as a liaison between you and the federal government. Washington is so broken and our federal bureaucracy has grown so large that individual needs of American citizens are too often lost in a sea of red tape. Our goal is to work with federal agencies to identify your issue and fix it.  Over the past two years, working with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of South Dakota veterans has been the most common situation we’re asked to help with. We have assisted countless South Dakota veterans navigate the Veterans Choice Act and other VA programs here in South Dakota, while simultaneously seeking changes to federal policy that will improve the care they receive under the current law. We also work frequently with the VA to obtain overdue medals and awards for veterans and their families. I have been able to present a few of those medals to South Dakota veterans firsthand as I’ve traveled around the state. It is a very special honor to recognize these vets, with their family and friends in attendance, and say thank you to them for their service to our country.  In addition to helping veterans get the benefits and services they have been promised, we have also been able to bring families together by helping individuals get visas or expedited passports. We also help people access social security benefits, file tax returns, work with the Indian Health Service (IHS) and make sure that federal agencies are treating citizens fairly and with the respect and attention they deserve. I am very proud of the work we are doing to help South Dakotans who feel like they have been left behind by the federal government and have nowhere else to turn.  Our South Dakota offices are located in Sioux Falls, Pierre, Rapid City and Aberdeen. Our staff members who handle casework are available every week day, either in person, by phone or by email. You can find the contact information for our offices on my website, www.rounds.senate.gov. My team works closely together across the state and in Washington, and we strive to provide a timely response to everyone who contacts us, particularly if it is an urgent matter in which we are able to intervene.  We take our work on behalf of South Dakotans very seriously, and I am pleased that we’ve been able to help so many constituents already since setting up our office two years ago. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you are experiencing difficulty dealing with a federal agency. We are here to help.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-need-help-with-a-federal-agency-give-us-a-call","rounds.senate.gov",14,7,2,0,0,0,0,0

More than 2,000 of our state’s farms have been in the same family for 100 years. Our farmers and ranchers play a critical role in feeding and fueling a growing global population. It’s easy to take for granted the ability to have access to high quality food. Without a strong ag community, we would struggle to put food on our families’ tables. In South Dakota, agriculture accounts for more than half of our economic output each year.  Unfortunately, ag income has been declining over the past four years. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), national net farm income, which is a key indicator of the health of the industry nationally, is down nearly 9 percent from last year and 50 percent over the past four years. This marks the fourth consecutive year of decline, and is mainly the result of weak prices for crop and livestock products. As we get into the 2017 season, it looks like producers may continue to see low commodity prices.  I was recently in Highmore, and had coffee with a group of farmers from around the area. Many of them shared concerns that they would end this year without being able to make a profit. This reflects concerns I have been hearing from producers in communities all across our state over the past couple of years. I share these concerns and I will continue to work diligently to make sure that South Dakota’s producers have access to crop insurance and commodity support programs in the short term. In the long term, only a return to stronger commodity prices will actually provide real relief. Also, with the new administration in place, I believe we can improve the regulatory environment for farmers, ranchers and landowners so burdensome and unnecessary rules don’t hamper production capabilities.  USDA will soon be led by a very qualified individual, the former governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue. During the first day of his Senate confirmation hearing, Gov. Perdue promised to make farmers and those living in rural America a top priority. Gov. Perdue and I both served as governors of our states during the same time period, and I respect his abilities. His leadership skills and knowledge of production ag from growing up on a dairy farm will be helpful as Congress works on the 2018 farm bill. I am excited to work with him to promote our nation’s agriculture industry and provide stability to South Dakota producers.  South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers are resilient. In their difficult line of work, they have to be. The 2017 projections from USDA show a harsh environment for producers unless crop prices rise. This hinges on a number of different factors, including economic growth and an increase in consumer demand for products. I will continue to work to prioritize South Dakota’s ag products in any future trade discussions the administration may hold. In the meantime, I would encourage farmers and ranchers who need assistance to reach out to our office and share your story. As the Senate begins work on the next farm bill, input from producers will be critically important.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-ag-economy-is-crucial-to-the-future-of-south-dakota","rounds.senate.gov",20,6,1,0,0,0,0,0

Although I disagreed with his plan, it was a friendly conversation.  I wish the president would have considered some of our suggestions.  The most egregious and unsustainable portions of Obamacare were delayed. But, they are impacting us now. It was a smart political move by President Obama to delay the problems, and as I told him would happen back in 2009, those problems are hitting us square in the nose today.  I remember thinking that if all of the planned Obamacare provisions were in place, people like my dad, who is now 89, would be subject to more limitations on their health care delivery than the rest of us.  I also remember thinking that in South Dakota, we already had a plan to guarantee the renewal of insurance policies regardless of health, to assure that coverage was portable from one plan to another in the group market, and that there were limitations placed on the marketing of insurance plans so that there was a strict ratio of the most expensive premiums to the least expensive premiums. In South Dakota, this actually worked. We also allowed children to remain on their parents insurance policies until age 29, if they were a student. Once you were in the insurance system and kept your coverage in force, you never had to worry about pre-existing conditions.  Today, we also empathize with those who are concerned about running out of coverage if they or their family encounter a serious illness.  This is fixable, we know this because we did it in South Dakota.  You buy insurance assuming that when you really need it, it will be there.   Obamacare will collapse under its own weight, regardless of whether or not the Congress takes action. We need a new plan that prioritizes patients and the free market. The government has never been good at running health care. You need only look at the VA or Indian Health Service to know that.   I think the American Health Care Act, which recently passed the House of Representatives, is a step in the right direction. Removing the mandates, eliminating the taxes, providing more flexibility for states and clearing a path for the free market to work again are all good steps toward reducing premiums for families and employers.  But, it’s not perfect and I would like to see improvements, including a transition plan for folks closing in on retirement, clear assurances on how we’ll handle pre-existing conditions and stronger promotion of group insurance plans because that is the most effective delivery system we have.   Should the House bill be improved?  Absolutely. Is it still better that Obamacare? Without a doubt.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-obamacare-has-failed-time-to-replace-it-is-now-","rounds.senate.gov",36,84,12,1,6,0,1,37

Late last month, President Donald Trump signed into law legislation that includes a provision of a bill I introduced which, in essence, makes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the primary payer for services under the Choice Act.  This is important because now veterans will no longer have to pay higher health care costs when they seek care at a non-VA facility when using the Choice Act. This is especially great news for those who live in rural areas, as it will make sure that their cost of visiting a physician is the same regardless of if they see their own local doctor under the Choice Act or travel to get care at a VA facility. It is also a win for doctors in the private sector who serve our veterans, as it will eliminate the bureaucratic reimbursement process so they can get paid in a timely manner by the VA when they care for veterans under this same act.   The intent of the Choice Act, which is to provide relief to those facing long appointment wait times and those who live far from VA facilities, had been undermined because of higher out-of-pocket costs to veterans and reimbursement issues for providers. By eliminating the so-called ‘secondary payer clause’ and essentially making the VA the primary payer under the Choice Act, South Dakota veterans will no longer be forced to pay more for health care services they receive in the community than they would for the same care at a VA facility.   In addition to hearing from veterans, our office has heard from doctors who were struggling to be reimbursed for the care they had provided. We heard from one doctor who was waiting up to nine months to be reimbursed by the VA and was owed millions of dollars. In one case, a hospital had refused to accept referred veterans for physical therapy due to non-payment from the VA. They simply can’t afford to see patients when they know there is a strong chance they will not be paid for services rendered. The intent of the law is good, but the manner in which the ‘secondary payer’ provision was originally written failed both our veterans and the private-sector doctors who treat them under the Choice program. I’m glad we were able to fix this section under the extension, and I will work to include the fix as a permanent component of Choice in the future.   My staff and I heard time and again of the hardship caused by the ‘secondary payer’ provision. My interest in introducing this legislation was a direct result of the feedback we received from South Dakota veterans, their families and medical providers in South Dakota. I thank them for alerting us to this glitch in the system, and I look forward to working with the VA on its implementation. Our veterans make incredible sacrifices for our freedoms; they shouldn’t have to worry about reimbursement issues for the care they have earned upon retirement.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/weekly-column-a-big-win-for-south-dakota-veterans","rounds.senate.gov",28,39,7,2,1,0,0,1

Whether students are moving on from high school, college or a technical institute, each graduate has an opportunity to use his or her talents, education and determination to shape their future and begin a new journey in life. I congratulate all 2017 graduates as they step out into the world to make a mark of their own.   We are fortunate in South Dakota to have good, quality grammar and high schools and more than a dozen universities and technical colleges, allowing our young people to receive a top-notch education right here at home. We are grateful for the teachers and professors across the state who dedicate their lives to educating our youth. Their commitment to education and teaching plants the seeds for a brighter, stronger South Dakota in the future.   As they step out into the world, I hope this year’s graduates remember the values and lessons instilled in them by their teachers, families, communities and neighbors.  When our four kids graduated high school and college, Jean and I gave them as much guidance and advice as we could, but at the end of the day, it was their responsibility to choose what they wanted to do in life and to make it happen. We are tremendously proud of the people they have become, and we are glad they have all chosen to stay right here in South Dakota to put their talents to use and raise families of their own. One of our greatest joys in life is watching them raise our grandchildren, the next generation of South Dakota students.  The United States truly is the land of opportunity, and receiving an education is the first step that allows us to achieve our dreams. Graduation opens up a brand new world to discover, and I encourage graduates to explore each opportunity that comes their way.  Regardless of our graduates’ next plans, I hope they will move into their next chapter with a problem-solving, kind and generous attitude about whatever happens in life. A motto that I come back to time and again, especially in my current job as a senator, is, “leave this world better off than when you entered it.” I work to do that as I represent South Dakota in the Senate and I hope that South Dakota’s young people will follow a path in life that gives them the opportunity to make this a better world for themselves and for all future generations of Americans.  They have been given the tools they need to succeed; the future is now theirs to shape.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-south-dakota-students-taking-the-next-steps","rounds.senate.gov",13,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Historically, a president's budget, which is required by law to be submitted annually, is viewed as a framework for the administration’s priorities and typically kicks off the appropriations process in Congress, where we are supposed to work our way through 12 individual appropriation bills. These bills allow us to make important changes to policy in the United States. When the appropriations process works as intended, it is the best tool we have to make certain that the federal government is a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars, reining in wasteful spending and allowing us to review programs to make sure they are working as intended. The problem is, the appropriations process has only worked as intended four times in the last 43 years. Yet the process remains unchanged. It is the epitome of ""Washington is broken.""    Rather than working through the separate appropriation bills individually, Congress continues to pass spending bills that preserve the status quo. I, along with a number of my colleagues in the Senate, have grown increasingly frustrated by this broken budget process and are working to fix it.    Even when the appropriations process works as it should, Congress still only debates around 28 percent of our annual spending, as the 12 appropriations bills only include spending for defense and non-defense discretionary programs. Meanwhile, mandatory payments on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest on our ever-growing debt account for 72 percent of our budget and are not even debated in Congress. They run on auto-pilot. Discussions about lowering our federal deficit must include addressing the way we manage our mandatory payments if we’re ever going to address the growing fiscal crisis we’re currently in. We simply cannot afford to continue funding the government at the same levels year after year without addressing the major drivers of our debt.   By properly managing programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, we will be protecting future generations from being saddled with debt, and also making sure those important safety nets are still available for generations to come. I often use the South Dakota Retirement System Board of Trustees as a good example of how the federal government should manage these programs: they are proactive about managing the retirement system so they can address and fix any issues well in advance. If federal mandatory programs were debated and improved by Congress every year, they would be much easier to manage and we would be in a better position to help them stay in good financial shape.   It is up to Congress to be responsible stewards of Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars. By changing the way we address our budget each year, we will be able to cut wasteful spending, make federal programs as efficient as possible and, hopefully, allow more Americans to keep more of their money so they can reinvest in the economy instead of spending it on taxes. A growing number of members in the Senate are beginning to recognize the need to actually manage and vote on the entire budget, not just the 28 percent, as has been the case for the last 43 years. I think we are making progress.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-a-better-way-to-determine-how-your-tax-dollars-are-spent","rounds.senate.gov",27,37,5,0,5,0,0,14

These days serve as important reminders of the tremendous sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform and their families. They risk everything to protect the freedoms we enjoy in the United States each and every day.    While our debt to them can never be fully repaid, it is our duty to fulfill the promises we have made to them. I have the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services and Veterans’ Affairs Committees, where I have been working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance legislation that will streamline and improve services for our military families. The Senate recently passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which is a bipartisan bill that will improve the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It accomplishes this by further empowering the secretary to hold bad employees accountable for misconduct in the workplace and protect whistleblowers from unfair workplace retaliation and providing assurances to the many hardworking VA employees who are dedicated to the care of our vets. I was happy to cosponsor this legislation that will, when signed into law, remove some of the burdensome red-tape within the VA.    I have also been working on a few other bipartisan bills to improve veterans’ lives after they leave service and transition back into civilian life. The Veterans To Enhance Studies Through (TEST) Accessibility Act will make sure veterans aren’t forced to use up a full month of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in order to be reimbursed for an inexpensive test or job certification. Under current law, vets are required to use a full month of their Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility to be reimbursed for licensing, certification and national tests, such as those required to be an athletic trainer, fire fighter or medical technician. This legislation would further empower and encourage veterans to use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to increase their qualifications, which I hope will make veterans more successful when transitioning to civilian life.    I also introduced a bill with Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) to help veterans’ access to capital to start small businesses when their service is up. It would waive up-front fees for veterans who apply for the Small Business Administration’s Export Express, Export Working Capital and International Trade loans of $150,000 or less. This bill would simultaneously help veterans transition to civilian life and promote entrepreneurship.    Most recently, I introduced a bill to allow more flexibility in allocating Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to survivors of service members. The Increasing Transferability of Entitlement to Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Act of 2017 would allow survivors of deceased service members, who had Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred to them, to reallocate those benefits to other designated survivors. I expect this legislation to help the families, who have made enormous sacrifice to our country, to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits more effectively amongst a family’s recipients.  These are just a few examples of the bills we are working on to improve the quality of life for veterans and their families. I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate—on both sides of the aisle—to improve and streamline VA services for our nation’s veterans.  It is but one small way we can thank them for their service to our country.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/weekly-column-veterans-selfless-service-keeps-america-free-and-safe","rounds.senate.gov",17,8,2,0,0,0,0,1

It requires strong leadership, a commitment to investing in our military and an unbreakable alliance among our allies.   While attending the G-20 summit with other global leaders in Germany this month, President Donald Trump is able to further promote ‘Peace Through Strength,’ a central idea to his America First foreign policy agenda. ‘Peace Through Strength’ is the notion that a strong military presence can preserve peace. It has been used successfully by leaders throughout history, most famously by President Ronald Reagan, who used this approach of deterring aggression to end the Cold War in the 1980s.  In recent years, the drawdown of the U.S. military, largely due to sequestration, has threatened our military strength and global dominance. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), I have been opposed to arbitrary constraints on our defense budget. In not spending enough on defense and neglecting the advances other nations are making, we are putting our nation’s fighting ability and security at risk and weakening global alliances. I am glad to see President Trump and Defense Secretary James Mattis understand the need to wisely invest more in our defense and rebuild our armed forces.  When budget caps and the threat of sequestration went into effect in 2011, we had more than 560,000 active duty soldiers in the U.S. Army. By the end of this year, that number will shrink to approximately 480,000. Our Navy and Air Force are also vastly underequipped. Yet today, threats to our nation continue to increase at an alarming rate. Most recently, North Korea likely was successful in launching an intercontinental ballistic missile potentially capable of reaching U.S. soil. Meanwhile, Iran continues to develop ballistic missiles and support terrorism. In Syria, the ongoing civil war continues to escalate.  Russian aggression has intensified as well. Not only does Russia continue to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine, after annexing Crimea, they also brazenly engage in cyberattacks against their neighbors as well as the U.S., as exemplified by their efforts during our 2016 election.  As Chairman of the SASC Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, I am deeply troubled by the attempts by our adversaries to use cyber activities to delegitimize our democracy, influence our public discourse and ultimately undermine our national security.  I am pleased that this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, which recently passed SASC unanimously, takes important steps to rebuild our military and helps address the challenges our military leaders have laid out before us.  Prior to attending the G-20 summit in Germany, President Trump made a stop in Poland. During his speech in Warsaw, he declared that “Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests.” The president also renewed America’s pledge to confront and defeat the growing threats to the West through an unbreakable alliance with our allies.  These principles, coupled with rebuilding our armed forces, will allow us to promote ‘Peace Through Strength’ and keep Americans safe.","status",NA,NA,44,48,2,5,13,1,1,1

In the two-and-a-half years I’ve been in office, these are the issues I’ve focused on. While some progress has been made, there is much more work to be done to get us back on track. That’s why I was happy about the recent announcement that the Senate will be cutting short the August in-state work period to spend more time working in Washington so we can make further progress on these important issues.    I was part of a group of Republican senators who sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the end of June, requesting that rather than spending the whole month of August away from Washington, we remain in D.C. for a few weeks longer to get our work done. The fiscal year ends on September 30, and we still need to pass a budget to fund the government. We’ve been working every day on an agreement to repeal and replace Obamacare, and tax reform is a major priority that we’d like to accomplish before the end of the year. For these reasons, we found it necessary to request that we remain in Washington longer than planned and keep working on these issues that, once passed, will greatly benefit South Dakota families. I support Leader McConnell’s decision, and I’m eager to roll up my sleeves and work with my colleagues to get much-needed results.    Meanwhile, I continue to get home to South Dakota nearly every weekend and get input from folks on the issues we’re working on. During the Fourth of July in-state work period, I appreciated the chance to meet people at parades, pow-wows and coffees. The one thing nearly everyone continues to tell me when I’m traveling across the state is that they want to see results, not rhetoric. Nobody wants the status quo to continue on.    We expect to be back in South Dakota for our in-state work period starting mid-August, and until then I will continue returning home on weekends to speak with South Dakotans about their concerns. We will also continue holding tele-townhalls so that I can hear from you firsthand even when my work requires me to remain in Washington. Tele-townhalls are open to all South Dakotans, and folks can call in to ask me any questions they may have. We’ll be distributing call-in information through our website, Facebook page and via our e-newsletter, the Rounds Report, which South Dakotans can subscribe to from my website, www.rounds.senate.gov. Additionally, folks are encouraged to call, email or stop by our offices in South Dakota or Washington. We go to great lengths to make ourselves available to answer questions and hear about the issues that are most important to you.    Getting real, positive results for the people of South Dakota remains my top priority. I’m happy that my colleagues agree that we need to be spending more time on issues like repealing and replacing Obamacare, reforming the tax code and passing a responsible budget. Families in South Dakota and across the country deserve better than a broken government, and this is one small step we can take toward fixing the problems in Washington.","link","http://www.rounds.senate.gov/","rounds.senate.gov",18,40,0,2,0,0,0,10

This has been particularly true in the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, where we’ve already had an accountability bill signed into law as well as an extension of the Veterans Choice Act, which includes a provision of a bill I introduced which essentially makes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the primary payer under Veterans Choice Program and protects many veterans from paying higher health care costs.   Most recently, a number of us who serve on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee introduced comprehensive legislation to enhance and improve veterans’ education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Under our proposal, when returning veterans are able to access the educational benefits included in the Post-9/11 GI Bill, they will be better equipped to pursue a successful career in a competitive job market. We want every veteran to prosper as they transition into civilian life, and getting a great education is the first step toward a lucrative and rewarding career.   I’m pleased that our reform bill includes three bipartisan pieces of legislation that I introduced earlier this year, including a bill to add all Purple Heart recipients to the list of eligible veterans who can access full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Purple Heart recipients have made incredible sacrifices, and deserve to have full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, regardless of the amount of time they served on active duty. The reform bill also includes my provision that would allow survivors of deceased service members, who had Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred to them, to reallocate the benefits to another designated survivor. We know that when an individual decides to serve his or her country, their entire family makes sacrifices too. While they can never be fully repaid for their sacrifices, we’re hopeful that this change will make their lives a bit easier.   The third bill, the Veterans TEST Accessibility Act, included in the reform package specifically addresses veterans’ education opportunities. Under current law, veterans are required to use a full month of their Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility to be reimbursed for licensing, certification and national tests, such as those required to be an athletic trainer, fire fighter or medical technician. The bill I introduced would address this issue by reimbursing veterans for the cost of an approved test and pro-rating the affected month of eligibility to be used for future educational expenses, such as tuition. Many high-demand jobs, including those in the science, technology and engineering fields, require tests and certifications. This provision would make the reimbursement process fairer for veterans so they can get the credentials they need to compete for good jobs.  Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country, and they should be able to fully use the benefits they’ve been promised when they enter civilian life. The name of the bill we introduced in the Senate is the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, named for the Army Air Service veteran who drafted the original GI bill, the purpose of which was to improve the transition into civilian life for returning veterans. I’m hopeful our bill will do the same. We expect it to pass out of committee in the next week, and I look forward to seeing it pass the Senate and be signed into law by President Trump soon.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/preparing-service-members-for-post-military-careers","rounds.senate.gov",18,23,3,2,0,0,3,1

It would have caused farmers, ranchers and landowners to spend hours filling out paperwork just to procure permits to conduct normal agricultural activities or spray for weeds along country roads.

Following recent votes in the Senate, it’s clear that reforming our health care system is no easy task. However, I remain committed to working with my colleagues toward a solution.  We believe affordable health care is best achieved through a competitive, market-based system that allows for innovation, competition and optionality.    In the quest to address Obamacare’s failures, some have been advocating for a single-payer, government-run health care system in which health care is provided for every single citizen for free and financed by taxes. Care is rationed, and citizens cede their health care decisions to a central government bureaucracy. Additionally, the cost makes it unsustainable for future generations. Either taxes – which are already too high – will continue to skyrocket in order to pay for universal care, our debt will spiral even further out of control, or both. Our ability to make decisions for ourselves and our families will suffer. Bureaucrats don’t like taking advice.    And we have many examples to substantiate this: In the U.S., California and Vermont recently tried to implement universal health care at the state level; both were abandoned as quickly as they were enacted due to its cost. In Canada, long wait times in their single-payer system are the norm. According to a Fraser Institute report, British Columbia residents have to wait up to six months just to get an MRI. Ontario’s own Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care states that residents may have to wait up to 11 months for hip replacement surgery. Droves of Canadians seek care here in the U.S., at an additional cost to their already-high taxes to pay for government-run health care. Across Europe, where universal health care is prevalent, the cost to governments for this care is exploding, contributing to rising national debts. But instead of increasing taxes, which oftentimes are already over 50 percent of one’s income, governments are slowing down care to curb the cost, and innovation is stymied.     Here in the U.S., the federal government has proved inept at running any large, nationwide program effectively, especially when it comes to health care. Look no further than Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Indian Health Service (IHS) for proof. While there are good employees in South Dakota at both agencies, nationwide these programs have been plagued with decades of long wait times, bureaucratic mismanagement, corruption and – most importantly – providing inadequate quality of care to Americans. In some cases, patients have even died waiting for care. Meanwhile, administrative costs have skyrocketed, wasting countless taxpayer dollars on paperwork instead of focusing on patient care.    I wholeheartedly believe that everyone should have access to quality health care if they want it. No one should be priced out of health insurance for themselves or their families. But forcing all Americans onto a costly, ineffective system that will reduce the quality of care and making them surrender all control of their health care decisions to the federal government is not the answer. America is home to the best health care providers in the world, due to a free market system that allows for innovation and competition. Replacing Obamacare with a competitive, free-market system that actually controls costs, allows for innovation and focuses on the patient will allow us to continue our proud tradition of being the world’s health leader.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/government-run-health-care-does-not-work","rounds.senate.gov",56,107,8,5,3,0,0,22

No single week in the entire year boasts a greater influx in the state's overall population than the week of the rally and the weeks before and after the rally. During this time, motorcyclists gather together in perhaps the largest bike gathering of all time.    What began as a single motorcycle race in 1938, the weeklong rally takes place in the small town of Sturgis in the Black Hills of Western South Dakota, a normally quiet town with a population of almost 7,000. During the week of the rally, however, Main Street Sturgis evolves into a bustling hub where motorcycle enthusiasts and other tourists come to enjoy like-minded company, entertainment, the South Dakota landscape and local food. The economic impact of the rally is impressive. A study conducted by the Rally Department of the City of Sturgis gauged the economic impact of the 2010 rally, which hosted 466,000 attendees, as generating roughly $817 million dollars in economic activity for the state. That is just in one year.  The city of Sturgis benefits from the rally, but so does the entire state of South Dakota. Though the rally only lasts 10 days, visitors often like to extend their trip to explore the rest of the state. With the Black Hills National Forest, Badlands National Park, Mount Rushmore National Monument, the Mickelson Trail, Jewel Cave, historic Deadwood and the Crazy Horse Memorial all within biking distance of Sturgis, visitors can experience the fun and excitement of the rally one day and the pristine beauty of South Dakota's Black Hills the next.    While the Black Hills are a must-see for visitors to our state, opportunities for fun and adventure can be found in every part of South Dakota. In the central and eastern part of the state, a number of glacial lakes and reservoirs provide for top-notch fishing, especially if you’re trying to catch walleye or smallmouth bass. Visitors to our great state often like to camp, kayak, canoe, hike, bike or golf during their vacation—all great ways to explore the land of infinite variety that is South Dakota.    Jean and I wish everyone attending this year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally a safe and fun-filled trip.  We hope that visitors will take some time to explore South Dakota’s stunning landscapes and rich history while they’re here in the land of great faces and great places.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/the-sturgis-motorcycle-rally-rolls-into-town","rounds.senate.gov",44,10,4,1,0,0,0,0

The U.S. military is the most sophisticated and capable fighting force the world has ever seen, and, with continued support from Congress and the president, can regain the required level of readiness lost during years of underfunding. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I’m extremely proud of our ability to come together to support our troops and their missions each year.     Recently, news broke that North Korea has allegedly developed a nuclear warhead that could be mated to a missile and reach United States soil. Many Americans are rightly concerned about this development. In response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons initiatives, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to approve new, global sanctions against North Korea. This came shortly after Congress passed and President Trump signed into law an expanded set of sanctions against hostile actors, to include North Korea.     While the United States is capable of taking military action against those wishing to do us harm, sanctions can be a helpful tool we can use to deter and respond to destabilizing, dangerous behavior without the risks associated with a military response. The United States has a long history of using sanctions as a tool of foreign policy, and I support its use as a peaceful attempt to apply pressure to rogue nations. Further, if North Korea takes steps toward becoming a more responsible actor in the international community, the U.S. and international community could reward such behavior by rolling back selected sanctions. A successful implementation of sanctions on North Korea will require international cooperation, especially from China. Specifically, these sanctions would directly affect North Korea’s senior leadership and their supporters.    However, we must keep all options on the table as we continue our efforts to stabilize and de-escalate dangerous situations, including that with North Korea. As I’ve said many times before, the defense of our nation is the primary responsibility of the federal government. The North Korean regime has threatened the United States and our allies countless times, and we must continue to send a strong message that aggression will not be tolerated.    But the Korean peninsula isn’t the only area in which we must keep a careful watch on rogue actors. Elsewhere in the world, Iran continues to violate international restrictions prohibiting ballistic missile testing and illicit arms transfers. Russia has invaded Ukraine and, in violation of international law annexed the Crimean peninsula. It also brazenly engages in cyberattacks, as exemplified by their efforts during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The recent sanctions legislation that President Trump signed into law punishes both of these nations, in addition to North Korea, for their continued aggressive, destabilizing behaviors.     Earlier this summer, I wrote about the importance of rebuilding our armed forces and promoting ‘Peace Through Strength,’ a philosophy implemented by President Ronald Reagan to successfully end the Cold War in the 1980s. Now more than ever, we must be prepared to use our military strength along with non-military measures to deter aggression and, if deterrence fails, make certain that attacks on our country or our allies are soundly defeated.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/standing-strong-against-foreign-aggression","rounds.senate.gov",70,55,8,6,0,1,2,2

While there is plenty of blame to go around, the majority of this debt can be attributed to the past decade, as our debt was $10.6 trillion at the start of 2009. In other words, in the past eight years, the federal government has accrued as much debt as it accrued throughout the first 230 years of our country’s existence. It’s no wonder military leaders acknowledge it as being a top threat to our national security.  Even more frightening, there is no sign of it slowing down.   High debt threatens economic growth by driving up interest rates and discouraging businesses and individuals from investing back into the economy. And it breeds even more debt as the interest on our debt must be paid to those who hold it – leaving fewer resources for other priorities such as roads, research and education.   Our broken tax system also plays a role by limiting our ability to collect revenues. Our current tax rates create a disincentive for companies to do business here in the United States, which then leads to fewer high-paying jobs for American workers, and encourage businesses to keep their profits overseas. Lowering tax rates would incentivize companies to repatriate that money and invest it back into our economy. Earlier this year, I introduced a proposal in the Senate to lower the tax rate in each bracket. It is but one step we can take to overhaul the tax code that will provide direct, immediate relief to hardworking families, jolt our economy and increase federal revenues.   While I do believe tax cuts are an important step to controlling our debt, the biggest driver of our debt is the rapid, unchecked growth of mandatory payments on safety net programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. If we continue down our current path, in less than ten years 99 percent of all federal revenue will have to be spent on mandatory payments and interest on our sky-high debt. No amount of cuts to defense and other programs such as crop insurance, education, highways and bridges will have a meaningful effect on debt reduction without also controlling the cost of these mandatory payment programs.  Mandatory payments already account for nearly three-fourths of our total federal spending today. This is because Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security have never been properly managed and Congress does not currently appropriately oversee them. They run on auto-pilot. Given that they are our largest federal expenditures every year, it is time for Congress to take an active role in managing their funding levels on a regular basis. This does not necessarily mean making cuts - it simply means giving Congress the authority to review them to make them as efficient as possible and to make sure they are available for individuals who need them, both now and in the future.   Surpassing $20 trillion in debt should be a wake-up call to Washington, which for decades has failed to own up to their responsibility to balance its checkbook. I continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to shake up the budget process in Congress, and open up the entire budget to congressional review – including mandatory payments. It is the only way to slow down the fiscal train wreck. Simply delaying action and looking the other way is not an option.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/20-trillion-reasons-to-reform-taxes-and-mandatory-payment-programs-","rounds.senate.gov",54,103,22,1,16,4,6,15

The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, is one of the most important pieces of legislation to pass out of Congress each year, as it provides our armed forces with the tools to successfully complete their missions and keep us safe. This year’s NDAA includes provisions that will rebuild our military, at a time when it is the smallest it has been since World War II.    This year’s NDAA takes important steps to reinvest in our military capabilities and allows us to appropriately address the readiness shortfalls we’re facing. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis said that he was “shocked” by the decline in U.S. military readiness. The size of our armed forces has shrunk to levels that raise our risk of not being able to deter adversaries or, with deterrence having failed, defeat them in combat. At a time of increased global uncertainty and unrest, it is critical that our men and women in uniform are in the best position possible to defend our great nation.      To better support our troops, this year’s NDAA authorizes a 2.1 percent across-the-board pay raise for members of the armed forces. Since our military is made up completely of volunteers, we are hopeful that this will incentivize our service members to remain in our armed forces. It will make sure our troops and their families – who sacrifice so much to keep us safe - are adequately compensated for their service.    I was pleased that this year’s NDAA contains 13 provisions I offered, including a bill to help the families of wounded warriors. Unfortunately, in many cases, wounded warriors require around-the-clock care long after their service to our country. It oftentimes falls on family members to act as caregivers. My measure that was included in the NDAA would require that the Department of Veterans Affairs caregiver program be added to the list of statutorily-mandated counseling items for military members transitioning into civilian life.     As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I’m proud of Congress’s bipartisan tradition of passing the NDAA each year. We put the defense of our nation, our troops and their families before the politics of the day. I’m hopeful that we can do that more often in the weeks and months to come as we try to tackle other important issues, like tax reform and addressing our national debt. It’s clear that national defense remains a top priority for Congress, and this year’s NDAA shows our troops that they have our full support. I’m honored to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and to play a role in making life better for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/strengthening-our-armed-forces","rounds.senate.gov",60,57,7,6,1,0,1,11

Local papers play a vital role in keeping citizens informed of what’s happening in their hometown, from decisions being made at city hall to milestone anniversaries and other celebrations within the community. They also allow us to learn and understand events happening across the globe, right from the comfort of our homes. Reading the paper over a cup of coffee each morning is a part of my daily routine while I’m at home.    To recognize the important role that newspapers play in delivering information, the first week of October is dedicated to National Newspaper Week. This year’s theme is “Real News…Real Newspapers,” highlighting the importance of trustworthy, factual journalism and news.      “Real News…Real Newspapers” is a timely theme, especially as more and more Americans rely solely on social media feeds to get their daily news. It’s important to remember that anyone with a smart phone or computer can publish anything they want on social media—it isn’t always true, and is often based on personal opinion rather than researched facts. We hold newspaper reporters to high journalistic standards, and it is important that we can rely on them to write fact-based, unbiased stories. Now, the editorial page is another story!    One of the most important duties of all newspapers is to cover elected officials and government decisions at all levels—federal, state and local.  As a former governor and now U.S. senator, I have worked with newspaper reporters for years, and I appreciate the hard work they put into covering government. In fact, I invite all South Dakota reporters to join me on a media call almost every week to update them on the latest from Washington and allow them to ask questions on any topic affecting their readers.    A free and independent press is a cornerstone of our democracy. As President Lincoln said more than 150 years ago, ours is a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Our press corps plays in integral role in keeping government accountable and making sure the public is aware of the actions of those they elect.    From the editorial teams covering meetings and events around town, to the publishers, advertising teams, and the folks who wake up early to deliver our papers to our front doors each morning, I thank South Dakota’s newspapers for their tireless work keeping readers in-the-know about what’s happening in our communities, our state, our country and our world.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/newspapers-are-the-heart-of-local-communities","rounds.senate.gov",26,12,2,0,1,0,0,0

With the farm economy struggling over the past four years and commodity prices down, the policy changes we enact in this farm bill are as important as ever. I’ve been talking closely with farmers and ranchers across the state about their priorities for the upcoming farm bill to make sure their voices are heard.    One major issue that I hear about time and again is that producers are having difficulty accessing necessary capital during tough times. To help alleviate this concern, I recently introduced the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Loan Guarantee Enhancement Act, a bill to assist lenders in supporting producers during periods of economic downturn within the ag sector. This legislation would raise the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guaranteed ownership and operating loan guarantee from $1.4 million to $3 million, increased authorized private-sector loan offerings for guaranteed operating and ownership loans from $3 billion to $8 billion and raise the cap for direct loans up to $3 billion. Lastly, it would provide spending assurance, rather than have these programs depend on the yearly appropriations process.    Increasing both the individual cap for these loans and the total amount of money available for lending will allow a greater number of producers to utilize the program. The FSA Loan Guarantee Enhancement Act would more accurately reflect inflation and the increasing costs of agriculture production today and make certain lenders have the flexibility to allow farmers and ranchers to weather times of economic downturn. If passed, this bill has the potential to immediately help farmers and ranchers in our state and around the country. This bill was crafted in close consultation with producers in South Dakota, and has received the backing of the Independent Community Bankers Association (ICBA), South Dakota ICBA, the American Bankers Association and the Farm Credit Council.    I also recently wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Senate Ag Committee to outline a list of priorities for South Dakota producers in the farm bill discussion. We’d like to see the federal crop insurance program adequately supported. With 17 million acres covered under this program in South Dakota alone, crop insurance is a critical tool for farmers to protect themselves and their operations. We also put in a request to establish a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccination bank to combat economic, food and national security concerns. A major outbreak of FMD would be financially devastating to our producers. Finally, we encouraged the committee to increase the cap for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. CRP is an important safety net, designed to assist farmers and ranchers during adverse times, such as during a drought like we’ve experienced in South Dakota this year. I appreciate the bipartisan work the leaders of the Ag Committee have been conducting, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on ways we can strengthen agriculture across the country.     South Dakota producers work hard every day to feed and fuel a growing global population. As in all businesses, some years will be better than others. During those more difficult times, it’s important that our farmers and ranchers have access to tools that can help them keep their operations viable. I believe my legislation, along with the next farm bill, will provide them with additional solutions to the problems they face.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/upcoming-farm-bill-discussions-a-golden-opportunity-to-empower-south-dakota-ag","rounds.senate.gov",15,11,6,0,1,0,0,3

We are putting more of our personal information online than ever before, whether it’s when we do our online banking, make a purchase, pay bills or something as simple as sharing photos on social media. It is important that we take steps to protect ourselves from cyberattacks.    The month of October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is using this time to encourage Americans to be mindful of the risks that can happen when we’re not safe online. When our personal information is compromised, it can result in drained bank accounts, stolen identities, fraudulent credit card charges and more.    There are a few tips we can use to protect ourselves from a costly and worrisome cyberattack. First, it’s important to use strong passwords and avoid using the same password for multiple websites and online accounts. Make sure to lock your smartphone and computer when you’re not using them. If you receive a suspicious email, do not open any links or attachments that it may contain and delete the message immediately. You should also be cautious if you get a phone call or email from someone claiming to be a friend, family member or IRS representative asking for you to wire them money. Lastly, avoid accessing online banking accounts or other sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi or from a public computer, as hackers can more easily access your information when you’re on a public network that is not secure.    While we should always focus on protecting our personal information online, it is also important for the federal government to take steps to avoid cyberattacks. As chairman of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, one of my goals has been to increase and improve the defensive and offensive cyber capabilities of the Defense Department. However, our cyber concerns extend beyond our armed forces. For example, as we saw during the 2016 election, our adversaries will not shy away from using cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns to try to influence our public discourse or impact our elections.    This summer, I had the opportunity to attend the grand opening of the new Beacom Institute of Technology at Dakota State University (DSU) in Madison, where the university announced the construction of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) on campus. DSU is one of the nation’s leaders in cybersecurity education, and the SCIF will bring additional opportunities for South Dakota students looking at a career in cybersecurity. Once they graduate, students will be able to work directly on national security and cybersecurity issues here at home.    Cybersecurity is an issue that all Americans need to be concerned with, as we continue to put more of our personal information on the internet. During Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I encourage all South Dakotans to review their online security measures and make adjustments if necessary to stay safe online.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/protecting-ourselves-from-cyber-threats","rounds.senate.gov",25,26,2,0,0,0,1,0

I’ll once again be spending opening weekend near Presho, hunting with family and friends.    One of the aspects of hunting I enjoy so much is the camaraderie. Our kids grew up learning to hunt, and all four are planning to join us in the fields this fall, along with their own families. My oldest grandson will have the opportunity to mentor hunt this year. While the grandkids are still young, they look forward to hunting season as much as we do! They enjoy helping dogs chase down birds, and afterward we all enjoy a meal together as we share stories about that day’s hunt.    I first learned about hunting when I was just 3 or 4 years old, when my dad, Grandpa Don, and the man who raised my dad, John Kauth, took me out hunting with them for the first time. However, I was introduced to the sport on the day I was born—the opening weekend of 1954. Each birthday, my dad reminds me about how I messed up his hunt that year!    Hunting is more than just a hobby for South Dakotans, it’s also a big source of income for many of our small businesses. Each year, people from all over the country visit our state to hunt in the best pheasant habitat in the nation. They stay in our hotels, dine in our restaurants and enjoy all of the other things South Dakota has to offer. We’ve had a tough year in South Dakota with this summer’s drought, and there will be fewer birds out there, but I’m confident hunters will still be able to have a successful season – both South Dakotans and nonresidents alike.     Hunting plays a large role in land conservation, as well. One of the best things we can do as sportsmen and women is continue to promote the use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. It’s a good program for farmers, because it provides them with an additional source of income and it’s good for hunters because it creates excellent habitat for deer, pheasant and water fowl to nest. As we continue discussions on the upcoming farm bill, raising the number of CRP acres has been a top priority of mine.    We’re looking forward to enjoying some fresh air, hunting a few birds and making even more family memories this season, and we hope you, your loved ones and friends will do the same. We wish all South Dakotans safe, fun and successful hunts!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMikeRounds/photos/a.922150994496415.1073741828.912773462100835/1742578945786945/?type=3",NA,78,11,11,2,0,0,0,1

Not only does it open up important markets for South Dakota products, it results in higher wages and supports our small businesses and producers. Last year, we exported $1.2 billion in products to other countries, including goods, machinery and electronic equipment. In particular, the North American Free Trade Agreement—NAFTA—between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, South Dakota’s top two exporters in 2016, continues to benefit our farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.   Since taking office, President Trump has indicated that he has a desire to renegotiate our trade agreements, and in May of this year, he announced the administration would begin talks with Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA. I am supportive of him making the best possible deals for American producers, however simply withdrawing from NAFTA, without a similar structure in place, would harm South Dakota’s producers.   Just last year, American producers sent $20.5 billion worth of exports to Canada and $17.8 billion worth of exports to Mexico, which is the largest market for U.S. corn and soymeal. Mexico is also the second largest market for U.S. soybeans and the third largest market for U.S. beef. American trade with our NAFTA partners has more than tripled since the agreement took effect, and has increased more rapidly than trade with the rest of the world. Between 1993 and 2016, according to trade data reported by the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. trade with Mexico increased by 544 percent and trade with Canada increased 158 percent.   Agriculture is South Dakota’s number one industry, and trade contributes to the overall health of the ag economy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) concluded in a recent report that NAFTA has had a positive impact on North American agriculture over the past two decades. The value of U.S. agricultural trade with our NAFTA partners has increased from $8.7 billion in 1992—before the agreement was implemented—to $38.1 billion in 2016, while imports rose from $6.5 billion to $44.5 billion. The leading NAFTA-traded products are meat and dairy products, followed closely by grains. South Dakota is a top producer of these products.  I have encouraged the administration to maintain strong ties with our NAFTA partners as they continue their negotiations. I have repeatedly asked our U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, to stand up for the United States’ agricultural industry abroad, and work to open up new markets for American products. Earlier this year, the administration reached an agreement to allow for U.S. exports of beef into China. This was a win for South Dakota ranchers, who are now able to sell their top-quality beef in a lucrative market.  Canada and Mexico are essential trading partners for our state and nation, and I encourage the administration to continue working with their leaders to maintain an agreement for free and fair trade among our countries. At a time of economic downturn in our agricultural sector, continuing to increase trade with our North American neighbors and other global allies is of vital importance.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/south-dakotas-economy-benefits-from-nafta","rounds.senate.gov",21,38,3,0,4,3,2,2

Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us to thank those who have bravely answered the call to serve.                                                                                             As a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have been working on proposals to improve the quality of life for South Dakota veterans. Our committee has had a productive year, and is looking forward to making even more reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in the future. We were happy to see the president sign the Veterans Educational Assistance Act into law in August, after it passed out of the Senate with strong bipartisan support. This bill makes much-needed updates to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, especially for veterans wanting to pursue an education once they enter civilian life.    It included a few measures that I introduced, one of which is a provision to add all Purple Heart recipients—regardless of length of time spent on active duty—to the list of eligible veterans who can access full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.  Another included provision will allow for more flexibility in transferring Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to family members of deceased service members. The Veterans Educational Assistance Act will allow more veterans and their surviving family members to pursue educational opportunities to set them up for good-paying careers in a competitive job market.    The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), under Secretary David Shulkin, has been working to fix the problems plaguing the agency over the past years. While there is still work to be done to improve veteran care, Secretary Shulkin has been committed to the cause and is working to streamline the agency he leads. Recently, the VA proposed its CARE proposal—their vision of the future program to provide care in the community for veterans. I look forward to working with the VA and my colleagues on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee to improve care in the community for veterans.    Also this year, the VA announced it would comply with the Emergency Care Fairness Act (ECFA). This is a huge victory for the nearly 600,000 veterans who have been waiting for the VA to follow through on its legal obligations to pay for their emergency room costs at non-VA facilities. Last year, I spoke with an elderly South Dakota veteran who fell down in his home in the middle of the night. His wife called 911 and when the ambulance came to get him, he asked to be brought to a VA facility so he wouldn’t have to pay the costly emergency room fees out of his own pocket. He was told that his condition required him to be sent to a non-VA hospital. This veteran was faced with thousands of dollars in medical fees, simply because he wasn’t close enough to a VA facility with the needed medical services. We have a moral obligation, and in this case a legal one, to take proper care of our veterans during and after their service to our country. I was happy that the VA made this long-overdue decision, and I look forward to the department finalizing its rules to comply with this law.    On this Veterans Day, we thank our veterans and their families, we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and we continue doing what we can to improve the lives of the men and women who bravely served our country. The freedoms we enjoy today are a direct result of the sacrifices made by our veterans and their families.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/thank-you-veterans","rounds.senate.gov",41,16,2,3,0,0,0,0

I believe we should celebrate our diversity. To honor their culture and the countless contributions Native Americans have made to our society, President Trump recently designated November as National Native American Heritage Month.   Native Americans called South Dakota home long before Europeans settled in the West. South Dakota was originally a part of the vast territory of the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota people. A number of other tribal nations include the Dakota Territory in their histories as well.   Today, our state is home to nine sovereign tribal governments, comprising more than 70,000 enrolled members. I have appreciated the opportunity to work closely with tribal government leaders on a number of initiatives both during my time as governor and now as a senator.   One priority of mine has been to improve the quality of care at Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities in South Dakota. It is well-known that IHS has failed to live up to its trust responsibility to provide health care services to Native Americans, particularly in the Great Plains Region which includes our state. Decades of mismanagement and poor leadership at IHS have resulted in a health care crisis created by government bureaucrats.  The IHS facilities within the Great Plains Region have the worst health care outcomes of any of the 12 regions nationwide, including the lowest life expectancy, highest diabetes death rate, highest tuberculosis death rate and the highest overall age-adjusted death rate. This is unacceptable.   I have repeatedly said that the first step to fixing the crisis is to understand where the problems lie within the agency itself. For this reason, I introduced a bill that calls for an outside assessment of IHS. My bill would require an in-depth look at the overall financial structure, organizational structure and quality of care at the agency. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs recently held a legislative hearing on our bill. The hearing was productive, and the testimony from Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate Chairman Dave Flute in support of our IHS assessment bill was helpful in educating committee members about the severity of the problems at Great Plains Region IHS facilities.  Our proposal is now moving forward in the Senate. The problems at IHS are at a crisis level, and our bill is a first step toward getting the agency back on track. The federal government must live up to its trust and treaty responsibility to provide quality health care to Native American citizens.  This month, as we honor the culture of our Native American friends and neighbors, I encourage South Dakotans to also acknowledge the hardships they have faced throughout history and those they continue to face today. The health care crisis at IHS is just one example of how the government has failed to follow through on its obligations to tribal members, and I will continue fighting to fix this problem.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/honoring-native-american-heritage","rounds.senate.gov",65,21,16,3,0,0,0,0

During this festive time of the year, let’s not forget that the first Thanksgiving was a time to thank the good Lord for all of our blessings. I am especially thankful for the opportunity to be able to work on your behalf in the United States Senate. Even when the debates on Capitol Hill get contentious, working for the people of South Dakota is a privilege that I’ll never take for granted.  I’m also thankful for the love and support of my family as I do this job. I truly would not be able to do it without them. We’re looking forward to spending Thanksgiving together at our house in Fort Pierre with many of our immediate and extended family members, including a few of our eight grandkids—we have to share them with their other grandparents sometimes! With such busy schedules these days, quality time with our family is the biggest blessing Jean and I could ask for.   Earlier this month, we celebrated Veterans Day. It is because of the men and women who serve, and their families who support them, that all of us are able to freely celebrate the holiday season with those we love. I’m incredibly thankful to our military community and our veterans for all they do and have done to protect our freedoms, and I pray for those who will be spending the holidays apart from their families. We can never repay them for their service and sacrifice, but as a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, I’ll continue working on legislation to improve the quality of life for South Dakota’s veterans and members of the armed forces, along with their family members.  Especially during the holiday season, I encourage South Dakotans to find ways to give back to their communities. There are food pantries and churches in nearly every town collecting donations, so that all of our neighbors are able to put a good meal on their Thanksgiving table. Monetary donations and food donations are both helpful, and as winter in South Dakota sets in, coats and other cold-weather clothing items are needed for kids, teens and adults. A number of volunteer organizations, charities, churches and even many local businesses hold coat drives every year, starting around this time.   As we gather with our loved ones to give thanks and count our blessings, let’s also say a prayer for those who are having a hard time this year and for those who are unable to spend the holiday with their families. Jean and I wish all South Dakotans a very happy Thanksgiving and holiday season.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMikeRounds/photos/a.922150994496415.1073741828.912773462100835/1779102428801263/?type=3",NA,36,5,1,4,0,0,0,0

Local financial institutions help families buy a home, start a new business or save for the future. As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, one of my priorities has been to relieve community banks and credit unions from the unnecessary regulatory burdens imposed on them.  I recently joined a bipartisan group of Banking Committee members to introduce a bill that would improve our nation’s financial regulatory framework and promote a healthy economy. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank act, which was an over-reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, our financial institutions and our economy have suffered. Our proposal begins to roll back some of Dodd-Frank’s one-size-fits-all regulations, which have been disproportionally hurting small-and-medium sized institutions who had nothing to do with the financial crisis. While there is still work to be done, our proposal is a good step toward allowing community banks and credit unions to expand, and I’m happy that it includes a number of provisions that I introduced.  Included in our bipartisan bill is the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, which provides small banks and credit unions with data reporting relief. It also includes relief from Dodd-Frank capital rules that allows banks to count high-quality municipal bonds toward capital requirements. This will be helpful to both banks and local governments that issue debt.  Our legislation also contains provisions of my Community Bank Access to Capital Act that would free small banks from having to go through arduous and expensive tests mandated under Dodd-Frank, make it easier for banks with less than $3 billion in assets to raise capital and grow. It also includes language that protects the credit of our military veterans who are awaiting delayed payments from the VA Choice program. Lastly, it provides rural appraisal relief for situations when borrowers apply for a loan of less than $400,000 and have trouble finding a qualified appraiser.  In addition to our most-recent bipartisan proposal, I have also introduced a number of different stand-alone bills this year to help improve access to credit for South Dakotans and reduce the regulatory burden of Dodd-Frank on local financial institutions so they can better provide loans and other services to their customers. I continue working to move my TAILOR Act forward in the Senate—this bill would require regulatory agencies to take into account the risk profile and business models of individual financial institutions and tailor their regulations accordingly. This will help put a stop to the one-size-fits-all approach to rulemaking we’ve seen out of Washington during the previous administration.

Every step we can take to provide relief to our lenders is a win for South Dakota families and businesses who rely on them for credit.

This year, working within this broken system, we gave negotiators extra time to work out a compromise on spending.

Yet Congress continues this pattern of passing short-term, stopgap spending bills.""   “I cannot, in good conscience, lend my support to this continuing resolution that merely continues federal spending and whose lone policy change could actually end up hurting South Dakota families. If we are ever to get our spending under control, eliminate wasteful programs and provide much-needed stability for our military, we must reject the status quo.  “This practice will not change until more of us send the message that we must either repair this broken system or we get our work done on time.

Military leaders have repeatedly warned our committee of the dangers that these short-term, stopgap spending bills have on their ability to adequately train, equip and maintain the force. In particular, under continuing resolutions, the Defense Department is restricted from starting new programs which is deeply concerning in today’s rapidly-changing threat environment. An example is the mounting cyber threat to our armed forces and our civilian critical infrastructure.

I have been a vocal critic of the current system, which largely rubber-stamps federal spending with very little debate or discussion. I recently voted “no” on a continuing resolution, which funds the government for two weeks, through December 22, 2017. This is not a decision I take lightly, and I’d like to take this opportunity to explain what led me to this decision.   This year, working within this broken system, we gave negotiators extra time to work out a compromise on spending. Rather than getting to work on a compromise package during that period, a day before the extended deadline of Dec. 8, Congress was forced to vote on another extension because no progress had been made in the nearly three months when the original deadline was extended. This new deadline comes just before the holidays, hoping it will add pressure for Members to accept conditions they may otherwise disagree with. This is not a good policy.  A number of us have worked on proposals to modify our current budget ‘process’ – a term I use loosely – so that we can actually do the work we were sent here to do: make informed policy decisions and make certain the federal government is being a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars. Yet Congress continues this pattern of passing short-term, stopgap spending bills.

The federal government has an obligation to the American people to be good stewards of their hard-earned dollars. We simply cannot continue to allow spending to run on auto-pilot, without a genuine opportunity for Congress to manage and debate the merits of individual programs.

Led by President Trump’s ""America First"" agenda, we have made great progress changing course this year. Not only have we undone many of the previous administration’s excessive regulations that stifle economic growth, we passed historic tax relief that will significantly increase our global competitiveness. We must build on this momentum by increasing trade opportunities, a mission in which the Export-Import Bank plays a vital role.","link","http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sen-mike-rounds-trade-is-crucial-and-the-export-import-bank-is-a-vital-part-of-it/article/2644299","washingtonexaminer.com",54,42,10,4,10,1,2,17

I’ve said time and again that we must get away from the centralized, overregulated system of government that has stifled economic growth. In the past year, we’ve made great strides in getting back on track to a freer, less intrusive government.   Just before Christmas, President Trump signed historic tax relief legislation into law, the first major overhaul of our tax code in more than 30 years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which takes effect immediately, will lead to more jobs and bigger paychecks for hardworking families. Additionally, lowering the corporate tax rate for American businesses will put them on a level playing field with the rest of the world, and allow them to be more competitive in the global marketplace, keeping jobs and income here at home.   In 2017, we were also able to undo a number of burdensome federal regulations. We were able to undo 15 Obama-era regulations under the Congressional Review Act, saving taxpayers $36 billion and more than 4 million hours of paperwork. The Trump administration has also withdrawn or reconsidered close to 900 ineffective and duplicative regulations. Some of these regulations include the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule, the Clean Power Plan, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) power grab rule and retirement plan rules. Each of these ‘Washington-knows-best’ rules would have led to more paperwork, more government intrusion and less freedom for the American people.  In the Senate Banking Committee, we made progress this year on bipartisan legislation to provide relief to our financial institutions. Our bill, which includes six provisions I offered, will improve our nation’s financial regulatory framework by rolling back some of Dodd-Frank’s one-size-fits-all regulations. In doing so, our bill will help assure that South Dakota families and businesses have access to credit when they need it. This is critical as we work to grow a healthy American economy.  Our armed forces also received a much-needed boost. After years of underfunding, our military received additional resources for the second year in a row, allowing our military leaders to take necessary steps to regain the required level of readiness. I’m also pleased to report that the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual bill that specifies where funds should be spent, included eight of my provisions that will help our armed forces accomplish their missions and take care of our troops and their families.  With 2018 upon us, we are just eight years away from our 250th birthday. In 2017, we made significant steps toward a freer, less intrusive government that will help keep us safe and grow our economy. While we should be proud of the progress made, we will continue to work on the important issues that will shape our birthday celebration in 2026 and provide a stronger, healthier economy that we can pass onto future generations.","link","https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/weekly-column/2018-brings-us-a-year-closer-to-americas-250th-birthday","rounds.senate.gov",61,78,10,7,11,2,4,29
