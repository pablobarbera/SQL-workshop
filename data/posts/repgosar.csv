Sadly, this uniquely American principal was attacked during the Obama Administration by partisan ideologues looking to advance a far-left, secular agenda.

However, after working alongside my colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus, we have been able to secure Conservative, time-tested changes to the original version of the AHCA. These changes will immediately eliminate Obamacare taxes, lower health insurance premiums, offer more choices for Arizonans and begins the process of rebuilding a patient-centered market.   Millions of Americans are drowning right now under the tidal wave of Obamacare regulations and mandates that have destroyed our entire healthcare system. The American Health Care Act is a life raft to those suffering and represents a down payment towards a true market-based solution. Additionally, the AHCA preserves protections for all Americans with pre-existing conditions and gives states the control needed to lower premiums, provide increased patient-centered choices and stabilize the insurance market.  While I will never stop fighting for a full repeal and replacement of Obamacare, the revised AHCA finally opens the door to free-market solutions that empowers states and individuals to have more control over health care decisions.","link","http://gosar.house.gov/press-release/rep-gosar-votes-support-ahca-down-payment-towards-market-based-solution-0","gosar.house.gov",186,211,92,20,2,1,3,58

Today’s proposal was supposed to be published last summer. Unfortunately, the NPS has continuously pushed out half-cocked and costly management suggestions a day late and more than a few dollars short, failing to reduce the herd to sustainable levels and protect the Park from utter devastation.  After years of badgering, the NPS has finally warmed up to our proposal to put Arizona hunters to work and allow these skilled volunteers to keep the meat. While this is encouraging, the plan announced today is far from perfect. Legislation is still likely necessary as this proposal fails to provide a long-term management plan, creates a new 1:1 sex ratio goal to encourage future breeding, provides too much flexibility for the NPS to scrap lethal culling, and fails to allow skilled volunteers to keep the entire bison.

Western Caucus members look forward to working with the Secretary and working group as the Sage-Grouse review moves forward,” said Chairman Gosar. “The Department should unwind overly restrictive and job-killing changes to land use plans made by the Obama Administration. Additionally, less than 0.1% of actual sage grouse habitat exists in the proposed 10 million acre withdrawal area. This political attack on affordable American energy is not based on science and should be completely scrapped as a result. It’s high time for the misguided and out-of-touch Obama Sage-Grouse management plans to fly the coop.”","link","https://westerncaucus.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/western-caucus-members-laud-secretarial-review-of-sage-grouse-management","esterncaucus.house.gov",20,5,0,0,0,0,1,2

His rhetoric is manipulative to the American people and a slap in the face to anyone with common sense.","link","https://www.democraticwhip.gov/content/hoyer-statement-supreme-court-allowing-enforcement-muslim-ban-provisions-pending-ruling","democraticwhip.gov",145,61,34,15,4,13,0,7

Kate Steinle was a vibrant 32-year-old happily living her life in San Francisco. Two years ago,  Kate was murdered by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal immigrant who was roaming free despite his seven felony convictions.  He was deported five times, but simply walked back across our open border.  Let me repeat that for you. He was deported on five separate occasions and was still allowed to find sanctuary in San Francisco. It really is as ludicrous as it sounds, and you know who you can thank for that? The left.  Democrats in this country talk about how inspirational illegal immigration is, coining them as “dreamers,” but we know the truth. Criminals, sex traffickers, drug cartels, terrorists and others cross our borders illegally to commit crimes, use our health care, take our jobs and threaten our citizens. All because the Obama Administration allowed it to happen by diminishing the Rule of Law in the United States. But we must not quit fighting the good fight. The Rule of Law is the only thing that protects freedom from terror, and we must stop at nothing to maintain it.  We’ve had enough. Obama’s open borders have wreaked havoc all over this great nation. Taking back our country from an illegal invasion of criminals starts now.   Kate’s Law will increase the penalties that may be imposed on criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry, deterring reentry and keeping criminal aliens off our streets.  San Francisco calls itself a sanctuary city, but giving sanctuary to criminals, rapists and murderers is simply harboring fugitives and endangering the lives of real Americans.  In Arizona, Grant Ronnebeck was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant from Mexico, Apolinar Altamirano, while Grant was working his shift at a QT Market in Mesa.  Grant’s young life was taken needlessly by a criminal who never should have been in our country.    We must not forget those sent to their graves by people who had no right to be here.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repgosar/photos/a.112866018788325.18743.104329699641957/1566659906742255/?type=3",NA,113,38,19,12,1,0,5,15

This week, a number of bills will be going to the floor for debate and a vote.  The majority of these bills deal with veterans, small business, and national defense.  I am a strong supporter of increasing our defenses nationwide, supporting small business, and, as always, giving our veterans the help they need when they need it most.   While strengthening our nation’s defense capabilities is critical, working within our fiscal means is equally important.  That’s why I’ve offered two amendments that will block an onerous Obama-era carbon rule and military amnesty for illegals. Funding bad programs not only wastes national resources, it wastes taxpayers’ money.  Last week, the House was informed that we would be discussing and voting on HR 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations (MASA) Act.  This appropriations bill combines the funding language from the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations, Dept. of Defense Appropriations, Energy & Water Appropriations and Legislative Branch Appropriations bills passed out of committee.  I will be reviewing the bill in its entirety, making decisions on whether it represents a fiscally sound approach.  As I mentioned earlier, I will be offering two amendments to this bill.    We must do everything we can to support our veterans and our troops, providing them with the tools they need to be successful.  And that's the #CongressmansCountdown.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repgosar/photos/a.112866018788325.18743.104329699641957/1599613966780182/?type=3",NA,42,16,8,2,0,0,0,1

On September 6, 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Irma, which damaged the island’s energy infrastructure, but escaped the worst. Then two weeks later, on September 20th, the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria resulting in:   • Loss of Life: 16 confirmed fatalities to date, a figure that unfortunately is likely to increase • Destruction of Property: According to Moody’s initial estimates go from $45 to $95 billion  • Energy: 1.57 million or 95% customers without electricity • Water: 44% of population without running water and structural failure at a dam with 11-billion-gallon water reservoir • Food Security: People stranded in the rural areas are potentially running out of food. 8 days into the crisis without the ability to refrigerate or cook has left many hungry and scared • Hospitals: 59 of 69 hospitals operational with unknown status and running on back-up generators that could run out of fuel at any time • Health Conditions: Many ambulatory dialysis patients and other critical care patients are in dire need of hospital care. Medical supplies are running critically low. • Telecommunications: 71.5% of cell sites are out of service • Transportation: Severe damage to 18 bridges and 6 highways; sections of 11 roads closed and only 3 major routes cleared of debris • Air & Maritime Ports: The San Juan International Airport has lost 6 of its 7 radars, forcing use of visual flight rules (VFR), which commercial airlines refrain from flying under due to insurance reasons. Many other maritime ports and airports are closed. The ones open are operating on restricted basis solely for military and hurricane relief.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repgosar/photos/a.112866018788325.18743.104329699641957/1674057992669112/?type=3",NA,32,20,11,1,0,1,16,1

This has led to a boom in development on state and private lands and a loss of state and federal revenues due to permitting backlogs.  The states have developed extensive regulatory frameworks for permitting oil and gas development on state lands. Energy-rich states not only do the work the BLM does, but do it more effectively, efficiently, and with less cost.  The legislation seeks to facilitate responsible onshore energy production on federal lands and promote economic prosperity in energy producing states in the West and in Alaska.","link","http://westernwire.net/western-leaders-push-for-delegating-primacy-on-oil-and-gas-permitting-to-the-states/","esternwire.net",63,41,8,8,0,0,0,26
