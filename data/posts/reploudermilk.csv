You don't have to look far to find examples of the EPA's bureaucratic overreach being counter-productive to good environmental protection. As recently as 2015, the EPA ignored an environmental contractor’s objection to excavating the Gold King Mine in Colorado, warning of a potential blowout. The excavation ended up causing a blowout that contaminated waterways in three states with toxic levels of arsenic and mercury.

At our age, insurance is a complete necessity.  The first year, my out of pocket was about $2k, met it early and it paid at 100% for the remainder of the year. I also qualify for the advance premium tax credit, so that year my monthly premium was around $160.00. Year 2, same insurer (Humana), premium went up to $212 in spite of the tax credit, and deductible went up to $3600.   ""It was a pretty mundane health year except for the 2 spontaneous fractures in my right foot, but I am STILL making monthly payments to my provider, since I didn’t meet the deductible.  Humana is no longer available in my zip code for 2017. Enrolled in Kaiser Permanente.  Still have the APTC, premium is now $188/month.  Deductible is $1650, which, unfortunately, I have already met, due to an emergency room visit.  More monthly payments.  I am eligible for Medicare on 01JUL, but I will still be making monthly payments for 2016 and 2017 ACA coverage deductibles for at least the remainder of this year,” – Kerry, Cartersville.","status",NA,NA,14,44,1,0,0,1,4,5

In 2014, health insurance premiums for my husband and I totaled $289 per month. Today, we are being forced to pay $1757 per month, a total of $21,079 for 2017.

Not only must Equifax be held accountable for the breach of their systems, they must also be held accountable for their failure to notify the public of the breach in a timely manner. Businesses such as Equifax that obtain and store massive amounts of information on individuals must be held to the highest data protection standards. I will be working with the Financial Services Committee on investigating this data breach and the inadequate response of Equifax executives. Furthermore, we have already begun working on legislation mandating businesses to notify consumers affected by data breaches in a timely manner.   Unfortunately, the outrage that followed the announcement by Equifax caused a gross mischaracterization of a bill that I have been working on since early this year. It was falsely reported that this bill (H.R. 2359) was introduced to give immunity to Equifax from any liability over this data breach. This couldn't be further from the truth. The FCRA Liability Harmonization Act (H.R. 2359) was introduced back in May, and is aimed at curbing frivolous class action lawsuits against businesses under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The businesses affected by FCRA lawsuits include community banks, credit unions, auto dealerships, retailers, and many other small businesses that extend credit to consumers.   Reports that this bill would grant any immunity to Equifax for liability in this data breach are completely false. The bill does not give any immunity from prosecution or civil lawsuits for wrongdoing to any business.  Furthermore, data breaches are governed by state laws, not the FCRA, so this bill would not apply to Equifax in this case at all with respect to the 143 million people whose personally identifiable information was compromised.  Finally, given the unfounded attacks on me and the rampant misinformation circulating about this legislation, the Financial Services Committee has not scheduled further action on this bill at this time.","link","https://loudermilk.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1185","loudermilk.house.gov",146,67,28,2,0,2,5,6
