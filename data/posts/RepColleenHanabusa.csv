Answer:  1)  No more annual and lifetime limits.  Before the ACA, 462,000 policy holders in Hawaii were subject to lifetime limits on their policies, meaning their coverage could end precisely when they needed it most;  2)  An estimated 9,000 young adults in Hawaii benefitted by the ACA provision that allows young adults to stay on their parents' health plan up to age 26; 3) Free preventive care...it's  required under the ACA;  4) Better value through the ACA 80/20 rule that requires health insurance companies spend at least 80 cents of each premium dollar on health care or care improvements.    Yes, Hawaii is a leader in health care, but the ACA has made health care in Hawaii better.","status",NA,NA,21,0,3,1,0,0,0,0

Thank you, Anne, for the questions.    Q:  I'd like to hear where you stand on the issues that the OGE have brought to light regarding appointments not being properly vetted and being rushed through.  A:  The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) has rightly noted that the Trump transition team and the Senate Republicans responsible for putting together the schedule for hearings have rushed the process by which cabinet nominees are vetted.  The process exists precisely to ensure nominees do not have conflicts of interest that might influence their decision making.  I strongly object to rushing or shortcutting the vetting process and I also object to Republicans characterizing Democrats as having ""chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country.""  It is the duty of Congress (meaning all Members) and OGE to represent the people and make sure nominees for Presidential appointments are qualified to assume their positions.  Exercising that right is hardly politicizing the process...it is honoring the process on behalf of the people.    As but one example, Congress, including the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) on which I sit, had been requested to change the law allowing General Mattis to serve as Secretary of Defense without having the required seven (7) years separation from military service.  [The law was changed in 2008 to reduce from ten (10) to seven (7) the number of years that a nominee must be retired from the military.]  The purpose of the law is to ensure that our military is run by civilians well removed from the military.  When HASC leadership asked Gen. Mattis to appear before the HASC and discuss his views on civilian leadership of the military, he agreed.  However, shortly before the HASC hearing, the HASC was notified that the Trump transition team would not allow Gen. Mattis to appear.    While the Republican leadership of HASC disagreed with the Trump transition team decision to preclude Gen. Mattis from testifying, they nonetheless moved to waive the seven (7) year requirement without questioning Gen. Mattis.  I, along with every other Democratic member of the HASC, voted ""no"" on the waiver, not because Gen. Mattis was undeserving to be Secretary of Defense, but because President-elect Trump and the Trump transition team denied us, the elected representatives of the people, the opportunity to question Gen. Mattis on this seminal legal requirement before Congress changed the law.  The process serves a purpose and what the Trump transition team did was simply wrong.  They muzzled a General who was ready, willing and able to testify before the HASC regarding whether the law should be changed for him and whether the change was in the best interest of our Nation.    In my speech opposing the waiver, I noted that Gen. Mattis has previously written about the need for civilian control of the military.  Denying the HASC the opportunity to question Gen. Mattis regarding his views was completely unnecessary.  Gen. Mattis wanted to appear and testify.   In the end, it seems it was more about President-elect Trump and the Trump transition team asserting control over Congress and telling the HASC how the process would be run.  While the HASC Democrats would not have it, the Republican majority let the Trump transition team have their way and they voted to change the law.    The takeaway here is that if the President-elect and the Trump transition team challenge the process when it is unnecessary, just imagine what they might do when they think it is necessary.","status",NA,NA,18,5,5,1,0,1,0,1

I'd also like to hear your take on PEOTUS Trump's refusal to provide full disclosure of his finances and divesting of his financial interests into a blind trust as his predecessors, and even his Sec. of State appointment has done.   A. The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests.  In theory, public disclosure preclude financial conflicts of interest by providing for a systematic review of the finances of government officials.  Annual disclosures are reviewed and certified by ethics officials.  While President-elect Trump filed a financial disclosure form, he provided much less specificity than his tax returns would have provided.  In essence, Trump refused to comply with what has been a standard practice for all presidential candidates.  Trump did agree to make his returns public if he was elected president (following the conclusion of an IRS audit).  However, whether he does so remains to be seen.    While nominees for cabinet positions undergo rigorous financial conflict of interest vetting, presidential candidates do not get the same level of scrutiny.  They should.  H.R.6340, the Presidential Accountability Act, was filed in the 114th Congress (2015-2016) to extend conflict of interest provisions to the President and Vice President of the United States.  I cosponsored that legislation and expect the President and Vice President be held to no less standard than other government officials.    Finally, a blind trust is a blind trust and anything less offered or suggested by Trump is unacceptable.","status",NA,NA,18,3,2,2,0,0,0,0

Fred Korematsu was arrested in 1942 for violating Executive Order (EO) 9066 and failing to report to a Japanese internment center for incarceration during World War II.  President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed and issued EO 9066 on February 19, 1942, forcibly removing over 120,000 individuals, mostly American citizens of Japanese descent, from their homes and into camps.  In June 1983, the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians concluded that the removal of people of Japanese ancestry into camps during World War II was based on “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”  A simple man guided by universal principles, Fred Korematsu dedicated his life to the fight for civil rights and led a  crusade that would eventually earn him a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998.  Let us hope the life of Fred Korematsu taught our Nation, including its political leaders, that stereotyping entire communities based on the color of their skin is abhorrent and morally wrong.","status",NA,NA,56,3,9,2,0,0,0,0

Executive Order 9066, issued by President Franklin Roosevelt on the same date in 1942, authorized the evacuation of all persons deemed a threat to national security.  Over the next six months, over 100,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry, including both of my grandfathers, were moved to assembly centers where, after processing, they were evacuated to and confined in isolated, fenced, and guarded internment camps.

Located on 160 acres in west Oahu, Honouliuli was hidden from view in a hot and dry gulch the internees called jigoku dani, or “hell valley.”    President Obama said it best in his Presidential Proclamation establishing Honouliuli as a national monument:    'Honouliuli serves to remind every American about the critical importance of safeguarding civil liberties and maintaining our values during times of crisis.

Watson presiding, issued an order granting a temporary restraining order (TRO) stopping the Trump Administration’s Executive Order 13780 dated March 6, 2017, also known as “Travel Ban 2.0” or “Muslim Ban 2.0.”  In the 43-page Order, Judge Watson found that the underlying intent of the Order was to discriminate against individuals of the Muslim faith, and was thus a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  In reaching his decision, Judge Watson relied on evidence of President Trump’s own statements, as well as the statements of his surrogates, that the Order was intended to keep Muslims out of the United States of America.  Congresswoman Hanabusa:   I was pleased to read the Court’s decision today granting the TRO against enforcement of Executive Order 13780.  This second attempt by the Trump administration to ban a specific group from our country based on religious affiliation was no better than Trump’s first attempt.  I join my Democratic Colleagues in Congress in calling on President Trump to stop these unconstitutional and un-American attempts to discriminate against Muslims.   It is only fitting that Hawaii is playing a leading role in standing up for our country’s history and tradition of welcoming immigrants with open arms.  I encourage all people who believe in equality, justice, diversity and inclusiveness to continue to stand together in celebration of our shared American values.    ###","status",NA,NA,34,4,3,7,0,0,0,0

Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02), Colleen Hanabusa (HI-01), and Don Young (AK-AL) introduced bipartisan legislation today to exempt Hawaiʻi, Alaska, and communities that rely on essential air service as subsidized by the U.S. Department of Transportation, from increases in TSA air travel fees. The Passenger Fee Restructuring Exemptions Act (H.R.1782) recognizes the unique reliance on air travel that residents of Hawaiʻi and Alaska face by lowering the states’ TSA fee to $2.50 for interstate direct flights. Congress raised the national TSA fee to $5.60 in late 2013, and could increase the fee to $6.60 in FY2018.      “The doubling of the TSA fee since 2013 has had a disproportionate, negative impact on Hawaiʻi residents and businesses who rely on air travel as the only available mode of transportation for everyday necessities like commerce, healthcare, education, and more. As Congress considers raising the TSA fee again, our bipartisan legislation will help relieve this cost burden by exempting Hawaiʻi and Alaska, and other communities who rely solely on essential air service, from this tax,” said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.    “Hawaiʻi and Alaska share unique geographic challenges that make our dependence on air travel a necessity.  As such, any increase in TSA fees disproportionately hurts our residents, tourists and businesses alike. This bill redresses that wrong by exempting Hawaiʻi and Alaska from the disparate impact of these fee increases,” said Rep. Colleen Hanabusa.   “Simply put, current aviation security fees disproportionately affect the residents of my state due to our unique reliance on air travel. I have opposed fee hikes in the past and have consistently worked with my Hawaiian colleagues to alleviate the hardships placed on those without transportation alternatives. This bipartisan legislation will address this inequity and allow our residents, who depend on air travel, to access and grow their economies without being overburdened by the growth of government fees,” said Rep. Don Young.","status",NA,NA,23,9,4,2,0,0,0,0

We must do better than that and I support increased funding for this serious disorder.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepColleenHanabusa/photos/a.170632829644808.33121.169979129710178/1490735430967868/?type=3",NA,23,3,0,1,0,0,0,0

Colleen Hanabusa (HI-01) introduced the “Military Assets Protection Act,” a bipartisan bill to clarify the authority of the military to defend facilities and assets against Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones.   “Our Armed Forces face a new threat from drones, and the law needs to catch up,” Dr. Dunn said. “Military leaders have advised us that they lack clear authority to interdict drones over domestic installations, even though we’ve seen the devastating consequences of terrorist fighters using these new technologies in combat overseas. This legislation gives the Defense Department the clear authority to use the latest technologies against drones that are a danger to Americans on military installations.”  “As a longtime member of the Congressional House Armed Services Committee, we are often confronted with conflicting interests that require us to weigh the pros and cons of legislation restricting the use of new technologies.  In this particular instance, it is a matter of our national security and the safety and protection of our military assets, infrastructure and classified information, including the men and women who serve in our armed services, civilians and their families that we take these steps to protect against invasive threats to our military, inadvertent or otherwise,” said Rep. Hanabusa.     The legislation permits the Secretary to authorize “armed forces or contractors of the Department of Defense” to mitigate UAS threats to a military “facility, asset or classified information.” The bill authorizes security personnel to “disrupt control” of the system; “seize and exercise control” of the aircraft; “confiscate” the drone; “use reasonable force to disable or destroy” the drone; or “disrupt, alter or intercept any communications to or from” the drone.  Both the Department of Defense and the private sector have aggressively researched counter-drone technologies, including air-to-air techniques, lasers, software override technology, and directed-energy (microwave) weapons.  Earlier this year, senior leadership at Tyndall Air Force Base raised their concerns with Dr. Dunn that base security required clearer legal authority to interdict drone attacks on assets or personnel.   Along with the legislation, Dr. Dunn led a letter with Congresswoman Hanabusa (HI-01) earlier this week to the Armed Services Committee, asking for its support as the panel drafts the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act.   ###","status",NA,NA,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

And, after blocking a resolution demanding the immediate release of Trump’s tax returns, Congressional Republicans are complicit in keeping the truth from the American people.  The President’s tax returns will provide a clearer picture of the President’s financial interests, including potential ties to Russia and China, and possible conflicts of interest.  The American people deserve the truth about whether Russia has a personal, political or financial grip on President Trump.     Since Watergate, all presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, have released either their individual tax returns or summary tax data.  Nearly three-quarters of Americans, including 50 percent of Trump’s supporters, want the President to release his tax returns  (ABC/Washington Post poll).

The purpose of an AUMF is precisely that: To define the limits of the President's authority to use military force without obtaining or reobtaining authority from Congress.   On behalf of the American people, Congress cannot and will not tolerate President Trump using old AUMF's as the basis for his recent and future use of military force absent renewed Congressional review and authority based upon a coherent strategy and sound foreign policy.  While President Trump's most recent use of military force in Syria was surgical and measured, the end result is that it has accomplished very little, perhaps in part due to the conflicting statements coming out of the Trump administration (Secretary of State Tillerson versus UN Ambassador Nikki Haley).  As Americans, we deserve a coherent well thought-out strategy and policy that will protect us from the unintended consequences of reactionary bombings.  Finally, bombing Syria out of sympathy for the children of Syria means little if the United States continues to deny these same Syrian children and families refuge in America.  This lack of a humanitarian response following military engagement is more evidence that President Trump does not have a sophisticated coherent policy going forward.     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 7, 2017  Hanabusa Statement on U.S. Airstrikes in Syria   Washington, D.C. –  House Armed Services Committee Member Colleen Hanabusa (HI-01) released the following statement regarding the U.S. strikes against the Syrian government:  Congresswoman Hanabusa:  The U.S. strikes on Syrian military assets Thursday night were a targeted and measured response to what is widely believed to be Bashar al-Assad’s uncivilized and atrocious use of chemical weapons against his own people, especially children. While the U.S. cannot ignore the internationally banned use of chemical weapons, the President's failure to seek Congressional approval is unlawful and I expect that in the days and weeks ahead, President Trump will work in close coordination with Congress to clarify his administration's plan to address the civil war in Syria, restore stability in the region and protect the innocent lives of those living in the war torn state.  Further,  Congress and the American people deserve a clearer understanding of President Trump’s short term and long term strategies in Syria and the region.  #","status",NA,NA,20,1,3,0,0,0,0,0

It is a disaster and 2017           will be the worst year yet, by far! Republicans will            come together and save the day.""    What Democrats knew was that Trump's words were not a prediction as much as a threat and that he would sabotage Obamacare by cutting off key funding that would destabilize the insurance marketplace.   Today, as expected, Trump threatened to cut off funding for cost sharing reduction payments under Obamacare, subsidies which are paid directly to insurers and amount to about $7 billion a year.  These subsidies help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people.  In response, insurance companies warned that withholding the subsidies would destabilize the healthcare insurance market.  So there you have it folks, if you can't get your TrumpCare bill through Congress when you control both Houses and the Presidency, you attack Obamacare and try to force the Democrats to work with you to pass a TrumpCare bill that will raise premiums, lower coverage and increase deductibles while transferring billions of dollars to the wealthiest Americans.  Just goes to show this President will attack the neediest among us where it hurts the most to try and force Democrats to work with him on a bad healthcare bill.

If it is approved, Pai will begin seeking public feedback on the plan.  If net neutrality is important to you, you should monitor the FCC process and participate during the public comment period.","status",NA,NA,10,4,4,0,0,1,0,5

Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Representative Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii) today introduced the Coral Reef Sustainability Through Innovation Act of 2017. In response to increasing threats to coral reef ecosystems such as climate change, pollution, and direct damage from humans, this legislation directs federal agencies to establish a competitive prize to catalyze creative solutions to mitigate the decline or degradation of coral reefs.   “As an island state, Hawaii relies on healthy coral reef ecosystems to protect our communities from extreme weather events. These reefs are also home to marine life that feed our communities and support our local economy,” said Senator Hirono. “By supporting innovative solutions to real-world issues, this bill creates an opportunity for individuals, government, and the private sector to partner together to protect our aquatic resources and coastal communities now and into the future. Collaborative, science-based partnerships are the kinds of efforts we need to address our common challenges, like climate change. Strong public support for this type of approach was on display last weekend, when people in Hawaii and across the country turned out to celebrate Earth Day by participating in the March for Science.”   “As guardians of our planet, we cannot afford to look back and wonder why we did not take steps to prevent the total loss of our coral reef ecosystem when we had notice of its impending demise,” said Representative Hanabusa. “The time for action is now. As a Congress, we must take the steps necessary to inspire big thinkers to come up with real solutions that will protect our planet’s coral reefs.”  Threats to coral reef ecosystems due to climate change continue to increase. Just last week, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at Mauna Loa Observatory reached record levels of 410 parts per million. At the same time, scientists are also continuing to understand the downstream implications of degraded coral ecosystems. Researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey last week published a study showing that the sea floor around degrading coral reefs is eroding, exposing coastal communities to harsher waves and deepening coastal waters. Out of the three locations studied, which included Maui, the Florida Keys, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the seafloor near Maui had suffered the most extreme erosion.  Coral reefs in Hawaii alone are worth $385 million per year to the local economy and provide a total net present value of $10 billion.  Aimed at fostering coral reef conservation and innovation research, this bill authorizes the 12 federal agencies on the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to use existing cross-agency funding to carry out a competitive prize competition. Additionally, the legislation allows federal agencies to work with private entities to both fund and administer the prize competition.   The Coral Reef Sustainability Through Innovation Act of 2017 is co-sponsored by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Tom Carper (D-Del.); and Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), Madeleine Bordallo (D-Guam), Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).    The University of Hawaii and the Ocean Conservancy support this legislation.  “The University of Hawaii is thankful for Senator Hirono and Representative Hanabusa proposing innovative legislation to advance coral reef conservation and protection. The people of Hawaii, and the world-class faculty and students of UH, are recognized globally for their efforts to understand, conserve, and protect living reef resources throughout the Pacific. As ocean temperatures rise and the oceans become more acidic, the science and conservation communities are rapidly working to assess the impacts of a changing climate on future coral reef health. Utilizing the mechanisms proposed by Senator Hirono and Representative Hanabusa, we look forward to advancing new partnerships with government agencies, private industry, and the research community to advance the science and practice of coral reef conservation,” said Chris E. Ostrander, Assistant Dean of Strategic Initiatives & External Relations of the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s School of Ocean & Earth Science & Technology.  “Senator Hirono and Representative Hanabusa have taken an important step to safeguard coral reefs today, in recognition of how much coral reefs do to sustain coastal communities all around the United States. Rich coral ecosystems in both warm and cold water support thousands of fishing jobs every day and lure millions of visitors from around the world every year. Ocean acidification and warming profoundly threaten coral reefs and the coastal communities that depend on them. We are optimistic that the Coral Reef Sustainability Through Innovation Act will help bring together new creative partnerships dedicated to finding solutions for the threats coral reefs face,” said Sarah Cooley, Ph.D. and director of Ocean Conservancy’s Ocean Acidification Program.  ###","status",NA,NA,15,3,3,0,0,0,0,0

The Act passed with a vote of 217 Ayes against 213 Noes (including 20 cross-over Republican Noes). Prior to the vote, Congresswoman Hanabusa spoke from the floor of the House about the financial burden Hawaii seniors between 50 and 64 years of age will experience in terms of higher premiums under TrumpCare.    Congresswoman Hanabusa: ""We knew Speaker Ryan would never call for a vote on TrumpCare unless they had the votes to win.  In the end, it was close with 20 Republicans crossing over to oppose the TrumpCare bill.  Nevertheless, the bill passed out of the House and will now head to the Senate.  ""What is pathetic is that House Republicans had seven years to work with House Democrats to fashion bipartisan improvements to the ACA.  Instead, they waited until President Trump was elected to call for the ""repeal"" of Obamacare.  Succeeding today after one failed attempt, House Republicans celebrated with President Trump at the White House for having killed Obamacare.  What they actually did was much worse: House Republicans and President Trump betrayed their constituents.  President Trump promised a ""better"" health care plan with ""insurance for everybody.""  That is not, however, what TrumpCare provides.  ""The House TrumpCare bill will leave an estimated 24 million Americans without health coverage over the next ten years.  It will cut billions from Medicaid and transfer ~$600 billion to large corporations and the wealthiest families in this country.  TrumpCare forces Americans between 50 and 64 to pay an age tax that will increase their premiums by five times more than what others will pay for the same coverage.  TrumpCare also steals from the Medicare Trust Fund, shortening the life span of the fund by three years. Premiums and deductibles will also increase, along with out-of-pocket costs.  Finally, to secure the passage of TrumpCare the second time around, House Republicans had to agree to allow states the option of waiving ""Essential Health Benefits"" and the community rating rules, which prevent insurers from charging higher premiums to those with preexisting conditions. This will make it very difficult, if not impossible, for those with existing health issues to find affordable healthcare coverage.  Finally, the effect, if any, of the House TrumpCare bill on Hawaii's Prepaid Health Care Act remains to be seen, largely dependent on what happens in the Senate.  ""In closing, I am saddened and dismayed that House Republicans and President Trump, in their eagerness to pass healthcare legislation, would put forth a flawed TrumpCare bill largely opposed by the healthcare industry and then publicly celebrate having been made aware of the impending harm it will cause to millions of Americans.  I will now stand with my Democrat House colleagues and fight to stop this flawed TrumpCare bill from passing the Senate.""","status",NA,NA,55,15,4,1,0,0,3,4

Presidential budgets are usually submitted in February and hearings are typically being held in February and March.  The first step is for Congress to agree on the discretionary spending levels which are then split between Committees for markup.   Given Trump's skinny budget (the President's policy statement), we know he prefers huge cuts to discretionary spending as an offset against his increases in the DOD budget.  However, existing sequestration limits would result in disastrous results absent a bipartisan deal to raise the spending caps established in 2011.

In 2017, more than one in four borrowers are already in delinquency or default on their student loans.  Further, a quarter of borrowers default over the life of their loans.  With interest rates forecast to rise this summer, Congress needs to address the student debt crisis and allow borrowers access to lower rates.  H.R. 2477 would allow borrowers with outstanding student loan debt to refinance at the interest rates offered to new federal borrowers in the 2016-1017 school year.  Borrowers with existing student loans can refinance them to a lower rate just as they can with home loans, car loans, and credit card debt.  Borrowers with both federal and private student loans can refinance at today's lower rates.

Hanabusa to President Trump: Don’t Sabotage Healthcare  Washington, D.C. –Today, Rep. Hanabusa joined 195 House Democrats in a letter to President Trump reminding him that millions of working families around the nation are relying on him to continue paying the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments.  Since taking office, President Trump has raised doubts about the future of these payments, which help seven million hardworking Americans and their families afford their out-of-pocket health care costs, such as deductibles and copays, through the ACA Marketplace.    “It is your responsibility to the American people and your obligation under the law to make the cost-sharing reduction payments and to stop other acts of sabotage that undermine Americans’ access to affordable, quality health insurance,” Rep. Hanabusa and the House Democrats wrote.    The President’s failure to commit to paying these subsidies is destabilizing the Marketplaces, and will directly result in higher health care costs and insurance companies pulling out of the Marketplace, leading to fewer consumer choices.  If the Marketplace is destabilized, those constituents in Rep. Hanabusa's district who purchased high quality Marketplace coverage would face higher health care costs and fewer choices.    “The decision to unilaterally rescind support for these subsidies will cause premiums and out-of-pocket costs to skyrocket and could cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance coverage,” the House Democrats wrote.  “Insurers have little time left to finalize their rate filings for 2018, and without certainty as to whether or not cost-sharing subsidies will be paid, they will significantly raise their rates or exit the Marketplaces altogether.”     In April, a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that insurance premiums for certain plans would need to increase by 19 percent to compensate for the lack of funding for cost-sharing subsidies.   “Working families in every state are relying on you to pay cost-sharing subsidies to help ensure that they can afford the health care they need,” the House Democrats wrote. “The stability of the nation’s health care system and the health of millions of Americans now rest in your hands. Their health care coverage is not a bargaining chip.”","status",NA,NA,20,6,2,0,0,0,0,0

Hirono and Brian Schatz, and Representatives Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard introduced the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act today, a bicameral bill that would expedite the visa process for children of Filipino World War II veterans.    “When called to serve, Filipino World War II veterans fought and sacrificed alongside American servicemen,” said Senator Hirono. “However, as a result of our country’s antiquated immigration system, these brave soldiers have been waiting more than a half century to be reunited with their loved ones. While the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole program provides temporarily relief for Filipino World War II veterans and their children, this bill codifies our nation’s promise to reunite these families.”  “Filipino World War II veterans deserve to be reunited with their families in the country they served,” said Representative Hanabusa. “It’s time for Congress to put families before bureaucracy.  Congress must remove the artificial barriers to immigrant visas contained in the current law and bring the families of our veterans together now.”  “Filipino World War II veterans in Hawaii and across the country have been waiting to be reunited with their families for decades,” said Senator Schatz.  “For these aging veterans who are now in their 90s, time is running out. It’s time to finally do the right thing, honor our promise to these veterans, and reunite them with their loved ones.”     “More than 200,000 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers served our country during World War II, suffering, fighting, and giving their lives for the freedoms and liberties we hold most dear,” said Representative Gabbard. “Today, these brave veterans are in their late 80s and older, with many having waited decades to be reunited with their family members who are stuck in the immigration pipeline.  They cannot afford to wait any longer. This legislation recognizes and honors the service of our Filipino WWII Veterans by expediting the visa process for their children and allowing them to finally be together as a family in the nation our veterans served.”  Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Representatives Madeleine Bordallo (D-Guam), Judy Chu (D-Calif.), Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Al Green (D-Texas), Gene Green (D-Texas), Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), Scott Peters (D-Calif.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Bobby Scott (D-Va.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.), Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.), and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) are cosponsors of the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act.  In 1990, the United States granted Filipino veterans citizenship in recognition of their service to the United States during World War II. Their children, however, were not granted citizenship. Currently, veterans must file for a family visa to be reunited with their children in the United States. Because of an antiquated immigration system with limited numbers of family visas available each year, it can take more than 20 years for these applications to be reviewed. The Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act exempts the veterans’ children, approximately 20,000 individuals, from the numerical limitation on immigrant visas.    ""We sincerely thank Senator Mazie Hirono for reintroducing legislation that would allow Filipino World War II veterans to be reunited with their family members after many long-awaited years. Filipino World War II veterans served our nation with courage, dignity and strength, and we must continue to recognize and honor that sacrifice,” said Chris Kang, National Director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans.     “It is critical that we continue to honor the service and sacrifice of our Filipino World War II veterans,” said Brendan Flores, National Chairman of the National Federation of Filipino American Associations. “We thank Senator Hirono for her leadership reintroducing the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, and look forward to working with other Members of Congress to pass this important legislation. Time is running out, and we must do everything we can to expedite the process of our veterans reuniting with their children.”   “Filipino World War II veterans have served this country with distinction and waited far too long – decades in most cases – to be reunited with their family members,” said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC. “We applaud and support this effort to remove any further barriers that keep the families separated from these military heroes.”     In 2016, after years of advocacy by Senator Hirono, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began implementation of the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole (FWVP) program to reunite veterans and their surviving spouses with adult children and certain other relatives. However, the program is limited and provides no guarantee that these veterans will be reunited with their loved ones. The Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act provides a permanent solution, amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to exempt from global limits the sons and daughters of Filipino World War II veterans who were naturalized under the 1990 law or other specified laws.    Senator Hirono has made fighting for Filipino veterans a top priority during her time in Congress, as the need to reunite these aging veterans with their loved ones grows more urgent every year. Currently, there are fewer than 6,000 Filipino World War II veterans residing in the United States who would be able to take advantage of the benefits bestowed by the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act to be reunited with their loved ones. In 2013, Senator Hirono and Representative Hanabusa reintroduced the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, which was later included as an amendment in the bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate (S. 744). However, the House failed to consider the bill. . In 2016, Senator Hirono led the successful effort to enact the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, which awards Filipino World War II veterans with the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of their dedicated service to the United States.  ###","status",NA,NA,11,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

Mr. Magana Ortiz, a well-respected coffee farmer on Hawaii Island, faces deportation after living in the United States for nearly 30 years. Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court denied Mr. Magana Ortiz’s request to remain in the United States.  “Mr. Magana Ortiz is an upstanding member of our community and does not belong in the category of dangerous individuals who should be prioritized for deportation.  In fact, during his immigration proceedings, the government itself conceded that Mr. Magana Ortiz possesses good moral character,” wrote Senators Mazie K. Hirono and Brian Schatz, and Representatives Tulsi Gabbard and Colleen Hanabusa. “Mr. Magana Ortiz poses no such threat to national security or public safety and therefore should not be a priority for removal. Rather, it is in our national interest for Mr. Magana Ortiz to remain in the United States where he can continue to work, pay taxes, and raise his family.”  The full letter is printed here:  Dear Secretary Kelly:  We are writing to request that your Department exercise its prosecutorial discretion and re-evaluate the request for a stay of removal for Mr. Andres Magana Ortiz of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. We believe the particular circumstances of Mr. Magana Ortiz’ case merits the extraordinary grant of a stay.  Mr. Magana Ortiz is currently in the process of adjusting to legal status on the basis of his wife’s citizenship.  In other words, he is trying to do the right thing. Mr. Magana Ortiz is an upstanding member of our community and does not belong in the category of dangerous individuals who should be prioritized for deportation.  In fact, during his immigration proceedings, the government itself conceded that Mr. Magana Ortiz possesses good moral character.     We agree that persons that pose a threat to national security and public safety should be a priority for deportation proceedings. However, Mr. Magana Ortiz poses no such threat to national security or public safety and therefore should not be a priority for removal. Rather, it is in our national interest for Mr. Magana Ortiz to remain in the United States where he can continue to work, pay taxes, and raise his family.    The Department has the authority under 8 CFR 241.6 to issue an administrative stay of removal—essentially, to decide whether to keep families together or tear them apart—and in 2014 Mr. Magana Ortiz received a stay. At that time, presumably the Department found his arguments compelling and consistent with federal law, which has not changed. He filed subsequent stays, one of which was not acted upon by the Department, and another that was denied in March of this year. As a result of this denial, Mr. Magana Ortiz received a Final Order of Removal and has been ordered to report to ICE for deportation on Thursday, June 8, 2017.    The Department’s most recent denial wastes the government’s time and resources on proceedings for an individual who poses no threat to our nation, while a parallel proceeding that could resolve the issue remains open. In 2015, Mr. Magana Ortiz’s wife filed an I-130 Relative Petition for Alien Relative. According to the District Court’s record, this petition was filed in September of 2015 but receipt had not been acknowledged by the Department until March 29, 2016. Given that this avenue is still open and unresolved and has taken what appears to be an extraordinarily long time, we fail to see the value in the Department’s aggressive approach to Mr. Magana Ortiz’s deportation.  In his concurring opinion to the denial of the motion, Judge Stephen Reinhardt noted that Mr. Magana Ortiz entered the United States from Mexico in 1989, at the age of fifteen, and has since built a house, started his own business, paid taxes, married a U.S. citizen, and had three U.S. citizen children. He wrote that Mr. Magana Ortiz is by all accounts “a pillar of his community and a devoted father and husband.” Judge Reinhardt further stated that deportation would deprive Mr. Magana Ortiz’ children of a parent and source of financial support, and possibly of a home and an opportunity for education, unless they follow him to Mexico, a country where they have never lived, and where they do not speak the language.    The Department has the power to keep this family together, or to break them apart. Given the urgent nature of Mr. Magana Ortiz’ situation, we request that you exercise prosecutorial discretion by granting a stay of relief.  In addition, we ask that you expedite review of his wife’s I-130 petition.  Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request.  Hawaii Congressional Delegation","status",NA,NA,35,7,4,0,0,0,0,0

The 14 grantees in four states and the District of Columbia will tell the story of the more than 120,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens, who were imprisoned by the U.S. government following the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan.  “The incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II is a painful episode in U.S. history, but one that future generations must remember and learn from,” National Park Service Acting Director Michael T. Reynolds said. “The National Park Service has an important role in telling this story through our stewardship of sites like Honouliuli, Manzanar, Minidoka, and Tule Lake and the support we provide communities and partner organizations through the Japanese American Confinement Sites Grant Program.”   Congress established the Japanese American Confinement Sites grant program in 2006, authorizing a total of $38 million in funding for the life of the program. Today’s announcement brings the current award total to more than $22 million.  The grants will fund a diverse array of projects that will tell this important story in a variety of ways. Using grant funds, the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation will enlist the help of high school students to develop video apps that will provide visitors to the Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism in WWII with a deeper understanding of the incarceration sites commemorated by the memorial. The Japanese American National Museum will use grant money to conserve more than 100 artifacts from the collection of Allen Hendershott Eaton, a folk art expert who acquired artwork created by incarcerees, which the museum will share as part of a traveling exhibition.    Japanese American Confinement Sites grants may be awarded to projects associated with the 10 War Relocation Authority centers established in 1942 and more than 40 additional confinement sites.  The program’s mission is to teach future generations about the injustice of the World War II confinement of Japanese Americans and to inspire commitment to equal justice under the law.  Successful proposals are chosen through a competitive process that requires applicants to match the grant award with $1 in non-federal funds or “in-kind” contributions for every $2 they receive in federal money.","status",NA,NA,18,2,1,0,0,0,0,0

The BUIILD Act would reauthorize all Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) programs, except for those related to Native Hawaiians.    Congress has repeatedly acknowledged the special relationship between the U.S. government and Native Hawaiians.  Most recently, in 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a NAHASDA reauthorization bill with bipartisan support and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs favorably reported out a Senate version to reauthorize NAHASDA.  Both bills included Native Hawaiian housing programs as well as bipartisan work to improve Native communities’ ability to address local housing needs, all of which are not included in the BUIILD Act.   “It is incumbent upon Congress to continue to acknowledge our responsibility to protect and improve the lives of Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, which the BUIILD Act, in its present form, does not do,” wrote Representative Colleen Hanabusa, Senator Brian Schatz, Senator Mazie K. Hirono, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard.  “As such, we urge members of this committee to oppose the BUIILD Act and to continue to work to improve on the progress made on NAHASDA reauthorization in the last several years.”","status",NA,NA,15,4,1,0,0,0,0,0

Hawai‘i History Day is a year-long history education program that invigorates the teaching and learning of history in grades 4-12. It promotes a theme-based, research-centered model for history and civics education. Students present their projects in an exhibit, performance, documentary, paper or website project. History Day culminates in the presentation and evaluation of these projects at school, district, state and national history days. Hawai‘i History Day is a state affiliate of National History Day (NHD).  The Hawai‘i History Day State Fair, a competition which annually involves hundreds of students and teachers from around the state, was held on Saturday, April 15, at Windward Community College. This year marked the 27th anniversary of Hawai‘i History Day and this year’s theme was Taking a Stand in History.  State competitors were identified from a pool of contestants at eight district fairs held throughout the state in February and March. Students and teachers from the islands of Hawai‘i, Kaua‘i, Maui, Moloka‘i and O‘ahu participated in these recent district fairs. Top qualifiers from the state fair moved on to the 2017 National History Day (NHD) contest, which was held at the University of Maryland at College Park this week.

The group of original cosponsors includes Representatives Colleen Hanabusa (D-HI), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), and Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Trent Franks (R-AZ),  Pete Aguilar (D-CA), Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN), Rob Bishop (R-UT), Bill Schuster (R-PA), Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Mike Gallagher (R-WI), and Brian Mast (R-FL).  “I'm proud to work with Senator Sullivan on an issue that has been a top priority of mine since we first began building our nation’s missile defense systems and infrastructure,” said Congressman Don Young. “With increasing threats around the world, specifically from North Korea and Iran, the United States must be steadfast in its commitment to protect the homeland – which must include further development of our integrated missile defense system. I’m determined to work with my colleagues to ensure the President’s commitment to these critical programs is not just campaign rhetoric, but truly a priority for his administration and the nation.”  “In light of the North Korean threat, the additional Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) at Fort Greely, Alaska, are especially essential for the defense of the United States, our states and allies,” said Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D-HI).  “This Act furthers the long standing tradition of Alaska and Hawaii pulling together for the good of the United States.”   The Advancing America’s Missile Defense Act of 2017 seeks to address global threats through several means:  • Promoting an integrated, layered ballistic missile defense system incorporating THAAD, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, Aegis Ashore, and Patriot Air and Missile Defense Systems.  • Accelerating the development and deployment of a space-based sensor layer, and advanced interceptor technologies.  • Authorizing an additional 28 Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) at Fort Greely, Alaska, and accelerating the completion of the EIS for an interceptor site on the East Coast and in the Midwest of the U.S. Missile Defense Testing. • Authorizing additional missile defense testing and expresses the need to change current test culture at the Missile Defense Agency. • Requiring a Department of Defense report on additional interceptions distributed across the U.S.; specifics on their optimal locations; and studies on the possibility of transportable GBIs.  Background:  Several senior officials at the Department of Defense, including General John Hyten (USSTRATCOM) and General Lori Robinson (USNORTHCOM) have publicly stated their belief that, due to the new pace of North Korean missile testing, it is no longer a matter of if North Korea gets the capability to threaten the contiguous United States with a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile, but when North Korea will achieve that capability.  Further, during the past six years, North Korea under the Kim Jong-Un regime has conducted approximately 80 ballistic missile and three nuclear tests – more missile tests and more than twice as many nuclear tests as both his father and grandfather combined.  Congressman Young, long a supporter of GMD and the senior member of the House Missile Defense Caucus, was instrumental in bringing the Ballistic Missile Defense System element to Fort Greely, Alaska with the passage of the “All-American Resolution” in the late 1990’s. His resolution stated that any missile defense system deployed to protect the United States against the threat of ballistic missile attack should include the equal protection for all America, including Alaska, Hawaii, the territories and the commonwealths of the United States.  ###","status",NA,NA,10,5,1,0,0,0,0,0

Hirono and Brian Schatz, and Representatives Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard introduced legislation to reinstate Medicaid coverage for Freely Associated States (FAS) citizens living in the United States.  The Covering our FAS Allies (COFA) Act would restore Medicaid coverage, known in Hawaii as Med-QUEST, for FAS citizens. The United States entered into the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) with the governments of the Freely Associated States (FAS), which include the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau that allow FAS citizens to live in the United States and receive certain benefits, including medical coverage. However, in 1996, Congress cut off FAS citizens from access to certain Medicaid benefits.  “We have a moral obligation to provide FAS citizens living in Hawaii and across our country with access to medical care,” said Senator Hirono. “The COFA Act will ensure that each FAS citizen in the United States can access health care, and help states like Hawaii dealing with unfunded mandates creates by the Compacts.”   “This bill seeks to restore much needed federal medical benefits to COFA beneficiaries residing in the United States,” said Representative Hanabusa. “It also seeks to ensure that the State of Hawaii, along with other states where COFA beneficiaries reside, are not forced to shoulder the financial burden associated with providing medical care to COFA beneficiaries, benefits arising out of COFA agreements negotiated and entered into by the United States.”    “This bill is about the federal government taking responsibility,” said Senator Schatz. “Hawaii has shouldered the costs here because we know it’s the right thing to do. But at the end of the day, the U.S. government—through Medicaid—should provide coverage to FAS citizens.”  “This bill will right a wrong that has gone on for far too long,” said Representative Gabbard. ""The Federal Government made a promise to these individuals, and it must uphold that commitment, and provide Medicaid to FAS citizens from Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands.”  Representatives Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), Raul Grivalja (D-Ariz.), Madeleine Bordallo (D-Guam), and Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) also cosponsored the House version of the COFA Act.  Since FAS citizens lost their Medicaid coverage, states with large populations of FAS citizens like Hawaii have taken on a large share of uncompensated care, putting strain on local resources, including utilizing emergency room visits for basic or regular health care.   The COFA Act continues the Hawaii Congressional Delegation’s efforts to restore Medicaid eligibility to FAS citizens. The delegation introduced similar legislation in previous Congresses, and in 2013, Senator Hirono included an amendment that would have restored FAS citizen access to Medicaid in the Senate’s comprehensive immigration reform bill.  Advocates for FAS citizens praised the Hawaii Congressional Delegation’s introduction of the COFA Act:  “Our COFA communities are grateful to Sen. Mazie Hirono and her colleagues in the US Congress for recognizing the fundamental need to provide equitable healthcare for our citizens and their families living and working in the United States,” said Jocelyn Howard, Program Director at We Are Oceania. “This restoration of fair and accessible healthcare support for everyone is consistent with the enduring partnership that has existed between our peoples for many years. It's a relationship built on trust, shared sacrifice, and our common faith in democracy.”  “The Medicaid restoration will go a long way to addressing the disparities in healthcare for our hard-working COFA residents and their families in the nation,” said Joakim Peter, Chairman of the COFA-Community Advocacy Network. “We pay our taxes just like everyone else but we do not have equal access to the fundamental solutions to our healthcare needs. We cannot tell a COFA resident, who has limited to no income, that she is treated justly and fairly in giving her a different coverage from everyone else, one based solely on her national origin.”  “COFA communities have contributed to our nation’s security and welfare, and as a country, it is our responsibility to honor the treaty agreements by allowing COFA migrants the same access to affordable health programs that their tax dollars support,” said Kathy Ko Chin, President and CEO of the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum. “We thank Senator Hirono for her leadership in introducing this important bill to ensure America fulfills its promise to COFA communities.”   ###","status",NA,NA,20,3,2,1,0,0,0,0

AARP:  ""AARP Calls on Senate to Reject Health Bill.""  ""The new Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed doors without a single hearing or open debate – and it shows.  The Senate bill would hit millions of Americans with higher costs and result in less coverage for them.  AARP is adamantly opposed to the Age Tax, which would allow insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more for coverage than everyone else while reducing tax credits that help make insurance more affordable.  AARP is also deeply concerned that the Senate bill cuts Medicaid funding that would strip health coverage from millions of low-income and vulnerable Americans who depend on the coverage, including 17 million poor seniors and children and adults with disabilities.” [AARP, 6/22/17]  American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network: “Patients With Pre-Existing Conditions Could Be Unable to Afford Meaningful Health Coverage.”  Preliminary analysis of the Senate bill released today shows the proposal could greatly harm millions of cancer patients, survivors and those at risk for the disease. … While the Senate bill preserves the pre-existing condition protections [i.e. the community rating provision], it allows states to waive the essential health benefits (EHBs) which could render those protections meaningless.  Without guaranteed standard benefits, insurance plans would not have to offer the kind of coverage cancer patients need or could make that coverage prohibitively expensive.  Plans could also once again set annual or lifetime caps on care forcing individuals to choose between their life and lifesavings.”  [ACS CAN, 6/22/17]  Planned Parenthood Federation of America: “Planned Parenthood Demands Senate Reject Worst Bill for Women’s Health In A Generation.”   “This bill is the worst bill for women in a generation.  In addition to ‘defunding’ Planned Parenthood and slashing Medicaid, it guts Essential Health Benefit protections, including maternity coverage and prescription drugs.  Thirteen million women could lose coverage to maternity care under this bill.  … Like the House bill, the Senate bill was largely negotiated by men behind closed doors, so it is not surprising that it closely mirrors the House version of the American Health Care Act, and would:  take away health insurance from millions of people and make it less affordable for those who will still have insurance, ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood by blocking people with Medicaid coverage from accessing preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers; [cut] Essential Health Benefits protections, including maternity careand prescription drugs, which disproportionately affect women.  Thirteen million women could lose coverage of maternity care under this bill; and gut the Medicaid program.” [PPFA , 6/22/17]  American Academy Of Family Physicians: “This Legislation Would Have A Profoundly Negative Impact On Americans.” “The Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 reflects many of the same flawed concepts that are in the American Health Care Act. In many ways, it poses a graver threat to millions of Americans, particularly children, people with disabilities and older Americans...The bill would phase out the Medicaid expansion and cap the federal commitment…. The possible damage goes deeper… States choosing to opt out would no longer be required to adhere to essential benefits such as prescription coverage, ambulance services or maternity care.  Allowing annual and lifetime caps on benefits diminishes the value of every policy sold in the future.  … This legislation would have a profoundly negative impact on Americans. The AAFP urges the Senate to reject this path and this policy. ..  we cannot and will not support a bill that will cause harm to millions of patients.” [AAFP, 6/22/17]  American Academy Of Pediatrics: “The US Senate’s Health Care Legislation, At Last Unveiled Today, Fails To Meet Children’s Needs.” “The U.S. Senate’s health care legislation, at last unveiled today, fails to meet children's needs...There is too much at stake for those of us who care for children to be silent. Pediatricians will continue to speak out for what children need until we see legislation that reflects it.” [AAP, 6/22/17]  American Hospital Association: “We Urge The Senate To Go Back To The Drawing Board And Develop Legislation That Continues To Provide Coverage To All Americans Who Currently Have It.” “From the onset of this debate, America’s hospitals and health systems have been guided by a set of key principles that would protect coverage for Americans. Unfortunately, the draft bill under discussion in the Senate moves in the opposite direction, particularly for our most vulnerable patients. The Senate proposal would likely trigger deep cuts to the Medicaid program that covers millions of Americans with chronic conditions such as cancer, along with the elderly and individuals with disabilities who need long-term services and support. Medicaid cuts of this magnitude are unsustainable and will increase costs to individuals with private insurance. We urge the Senate to go back to the drawing board and develop legislation that continues to provide coverage to all Americans who currently have it.” [AHA, 6/22/17]  American Federation Of Teachers: “This Proposal Would Be A Disaster For America’s Families -- It Raises Costs, Cuts Coverage, Weakens Protections, And Ends Medicaid As We Know It.” “Now that we have leafed through the 142 pages of the Senate Republicans’ bill, it’s obvious why they wanted to keep it a secret. This proposal would be a disaster for America’s families—it raises costs, cuts coverage, weakens protections and ends Medicaid as we know it. Instead of repairing Obamacare, Republicans have doubled down on what the House-passed Trumpcare would do—rip away healthcare from millions to give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. In the Senate, they just did it in a different way.” [AFT, 6/22/17]  Consumers Union: “The Devil Is In The Details, And Now That We’ve Seen The Bill, It’s Understandable Why Senate Leaders Have Kept It Hidden Behind Closed Doors.” “The devil is in the details, and now that we’ve seen the bill, it’s understandable why Senate leaders have kept it hidden behind closed doors. Rather than starting from scratch — as Senators promised — this latest version of the American Health Care Act is equally misguided and harsh as the House bill. The consequences of the Senate’s legislation are just as dangerous: millions of Americans could lose coverage, consumers would likely pay more out-of-pocket for care and higher premiums for plans that cover less, and Medicaid would be cut off at the knees. While the bill may appear to provide consideration for those with preexisting conditions, the option to waive Essential Health Benefits could leave all privately insured Americans at the mercy of annual and lifetime caps — putting meaningful coverage out of reach for many Americans, especially those with chronic and pre-existing conditions.” [Consumers Union, 6/22/17]","status",NA,NA,10,3,0,0,0,0,0,2

Hanabusa. “Following the November 2016 election, which we now know Russia sought to disrupt and influence, the struggle for a right to vote is paramount. We must reaffirm our commitment to the integrity of our democracy and electoral process by ensuring that every eligible American has an equal right to vote and equal access to the ballot box.”  Since 2010, 22 states across the country enacted measures that would make it harder for millions of eligible Americans to register or vote. As Americans, Democratic Members of Congress vowed not to sit idly by as these unprecedented laws try to turn back the clock and erect barriers to voting for military, disabled, minority, young, elderly, and low-income Americans.  H.R. 12, the Voter Empowerment Act, restores the principle of democracy to our electoral process. The legislation contains three main sections: improving access, protecting integrity, and ensuring accountability. In brief, H.R. 12 will –   modernize voter registration;   ensure equal access to the ballot box for all Americans;   prohibit deceptive practices and voter intimidation that keep people from exercising their constitutional right to vote; and   authorize assistance for states to protect the security of voter information and processes.  “President Lyndon Johnson understood the power of the vote to break down injustice,” said Rep. Hanabusa. “The Voter Empowerment Act will restore our nation's commitment to democracy and justice by ensuring equal and unfettered access to the ballot box for every eligible American voter. I call on my Republican colleagues to reject any effort to make it harder to vote and join me in encouraging all Americans to exercise their constitutional right to vote by supporting the Voter Empowerment Act.”","status",NA,NA,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The impacts of the bill on Hawaii residents are listed below.  The bill reduces funding for Medicare, which will negatively affect beneficiaries. The bill repeals a 0.9 percent payroll tax on higher-income workers, which would remove over $100 billion over ten years from the Hospital Insurance trust fund. This would hasten the insolvency of Medicare and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future.  The bill also removes nearly $25 billion in required payments from pharmaceutical companies over ten years from the Part B trust fund, which would increase premiums for people on Medicare.  • In 2016, Medicare provided coverage for 224,880 Hawaii residents of all ages, or about 16 percent of the state’s population. • About 91 percent of Hawaii residents with Medicare are over age 65 and 9 percent are younger people with disabilities under the age of 65. The bill unfairly penalizes older Americans with an Age Tax. The bill discriminates against 6.1 million Americans ages 50-64 in the individual (non-group) health insurance market by allowing insurance companies to charge older people five times or more what others pay for the same coverage. At the same time, it significantly reduces tax credits now available to lower and middle-income older persons to help pay premium costs. • About 20,098 (or 8 percent of) Hawaii residents between the ages of 50 and 64 are enrolled in the individual market and would be impacted by the AHCA’s age tax. • 50- to 64-year-olds comprise 54 percent of all adults receiving premium tax credit assistance in Hawaii. The Age Tax would significantly increase premiums. • A 55-year-old Hawaiian earning $25,000 annually would see her premium increase by an average $3,578. • A 64-year-old Hawaiian earning $25,000 annually would see his premium increase by an average $6,791. Hawaii residents simply cannot afford to pay the higher premiums. • In 2015, half of all Hawaii residents ages 50-64 buying insurance in the individual market have incomes of $19,200 or less a year. The bill removes protections for people with pre-existing health conditions. It would allow insurance companies to once again charge higher premiums based on a person’s health condition (known as medical underwriting), significantly raising premiums and making health care unaffordable. • About 93,366 (or 34 percent of) 50-64 year olds in Hawaii have a preexisting condition. The bill weakens protections for people with individual and employer coverage. It allows states to waive federal standards for minimum coverage (known as Essential Health Benefits) allowing insurers to sell less comprehensive, potentially even skimpy coverage. The bill also weakens protections that ensure a person doesn’t end up with catastrophic out-of-pocket costs. This weakening includes the requirement that insurance companies must limit consumers’ annual out-of-pocket costs (such as deductibles and copays). It also includes the ban on insurance companies setting caps on how much they would cover annually, or over a person’s lifetime. These changes would affect people in the individual market and those with employer-sponsored coverage. The result would be less choice and reduced access to needed services for people with pre-existing conditions or who need medical care. • 20,098 (or 8 percent of) Hawaii residents ages 50-64 receive coverage through the individual market and could be affected by the bill. • 190,634 (or 73 percent of) Hawaii residents ages 50-64 receive coverage through their employer, and they too could be affected by the bill. The bill cuts over $800 billion from Medicaid. The bill creates a capped financing structure in the Medicaid program and cuts $839 billion – nearly 25 percent-- over ten years. Both per capita cap and block grant financing would likely shift significant costs to states, state taxpayers, and families. The bill could lead to cuts in provider payments, program eligibility, services, or all of the above – ultimately harming some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens. • In 2017, more than 346,000 Hawaii residents received health coverage and long-term services and supports (LTSS) through Medicaid. • In FY 2013, about 40,000 low-income Medicare beneficiaries in Hawaii received Medicaid. Most people prefer to receive LTSS in their homes and communities. Nursing home care is generally more expensive than serving people in the community, but home and community-based services (HCBS) is an optional service in Medicaid. Cutting federal Medicaid spending jeopardizes access to HCBS, forcing people to rely on more expensive nursing home care. • In FY2015, nursing facilities comprised 76.1 percent of Medicaid LTSS expenditures in Hawaii for older adults and people with physical disabilities.","status",NA,NA,16,6,13,0,0,0,1,7

Instead of attacking women's health, President Trump should focus on reinforcing Title IX protections, raising wages, strengthening the middle class, lowering the costs of health care and fighting for pay equity, quality child care, retirement security and access to paid family leave.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepColleenHanabusa/photos/a.170632829644808.33121.169979129710178/1641985379176205/?type=3",NA,17,6,3,0,0,1,6,5

This follows the set of proposals, endorsed by the New Democrat Coalition, targeted at stabilizing health insurance markets and bringing down the cost of healthcare for all Americans.     “We strongly support the Affordable Care Act [which helps millions of families purchase affordable health coverage, and helps keep out of pocket costs low],” the Members wrote to Speaker Ryan. “The individual market, accounting for seven percent of health care enrollees nationwide, needs improvement. Senate Republicans have indicated a willingness to work with Democrats to address this. We are ready to work with you in a bipartisan manner to stabilize and improve the individual market.”  ""Republicans and Democrats simply must come together to improve the health care insurance market,"" said Representative Hanabusa.  ""Those dependent on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the elderly, sick and disabled, expect Congress to put aside their partisan differences and fashion a health care bill that will do more good than harm.  This letter demonstrates that 89 Members of the House, including 52 New Dems, are committed to working together in a bipartisan manner to get the job done.""    The letter outlines bipartisan solutions to stabilize the market that New Dems helped lead less than two weeks ago, including: 1.     Reauthorizing and making permanent federal reinsurance programs.  2.     Funding the Cost-Sharing Reduction Subsidies (CSR).  3.     Getting more people covered, and ensuring participation.  4.

In pertinent part, the bill accomplishes the following:   For Russia, the bill prevents the President from repealing existing sanctions tied to Ukraine and election interference.  The bill also imposes new sanctions on companies involved in Russia-financed off-shore oil projects; those doing business with the Russian military or intelligence agencies, those investing in Russian state-owned entitles and those participating in Russian oil or gas pipeline construction in Russia.  The bill strengthens sanctions and provides for Congressional review before a person or entity is removed from the sanction list or an application for waiver from sanctions to a person or entity is granted.  The bill also counters Russian disinformation and cyber intrusions by authorizing U.S. participation with allies to push back against Russian aggression in these areas.  For Iran, the bill mandates new sanctions on those who contribute to Iran’s ballistic missile program and on anyone who provides or attempts to provide financial, material, technological or other support to supporters of the program.  The bill requires the President impose sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and requires the Secretary of State to submit a list to Congress of persons responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of human rights against individuals in Iran who:  o seek to expose illegal activity carried out by the Government of Iran, or  o defend human rights, such as freedoms of religion, expression, association and assembly, the right to a fair trial and democratic elections. The bill also requires the President to sanction anyone who knowingly contributes to the supply, sale, or transfer directly or indirectly to or from Iran or for the use in or benefit of Iran of arms, including attack helicopters, missiles, armored combat vehicles, battle tanks or provides training or financial services relating to the supply, sale, transfer, or use of arms and related materiel.  For North Korea, the bill expands mandatory and discretionary sanctions on DPRK government transactions involving precious metals and minerals, jet fuel, coal, iron ore and textiles.  The bill also provides that North Korea’s two largest trading partners, China and Russia, as well as other countries and persons trading with the North Korean regime, could face sanctions when the bill becomes law.   The bill also closes loopholes exploited by the Kim regime by:  • Expanding financial restrictions on banks providing correspondent banking services to North Korea and restricting certain types of U.S. foreign assistance to countries that buy or sell military equipment or services from North Korea. • Expanding scrutiny on North Korean-owned and -operated shipping vessels and providing consequences for entities that offer flags of convenience to North Korean ships.  • Requiring scrutiny on countries and persons that host North Korea laborers, as these laborers are often exploited while their wages provide a source of revenue to the Kim regime.  Given its overwhelming support of the Russia-Iran-North Korea Sanctions Bill, Congress looks forward to the President signing the bill into law.","status",NA,NA,18,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Sojourner Truth.  These women showed enormous courage for decades in fighting for women’s rights, but unfortunately none of them lived to see the voting rights of women recognized.  It took 72 years between the first major women’s rights conference at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848, and the adoption of the 19th Amendment in 1920.  Unfortunately, although the adoption of the 19th Amendment in 1920 was a key landmark in our country’s history, millions of American women of color would have to wait decades, until the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, to have their right to vote truly recognized.  On June 25, 2013, however, in a 5-4 decision, in Shelby v Holder, the Supreme Court significantly weakened the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Since then, Democrats have been calling for the enactment of the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 2978), which seeks to restore the full protections of the VRA, while responding to the Supreme Court’s decision.  However, Republicans are blocking this critical bill from coming to the House Floor.  Democrats will continue to fight for enactment of the Voting Rights Advancement Act, as well as to fight against the numerous efforts at voter suppression across the country.

Speaker Ryan can express sympathy for ""those who have done nothing wrong,"" but the reality is Speaker Ryan and 197 other House Republicans voted against the 2010 DREAM Act.  ""If House Republicans want to solve this injustice, they should bring the DREAM Act to the House floor immediately and end the uncertainty caused by President Trump's ill-advised DACA decision.  ""DREAMers are young men and women with real lives, jobs, businesses, families and hopes for their future.  Many DREAMers have spent more time in the United States than in their home countries.

A fifth division with $1.6B for the border wall was added by the House GOP.  In September, the House has eight remaining FY18 appropriations bills:  Interior & Environment, Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Science, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor,Health & Human Services, Education, State & Foreign Operations, and Transportation-Housing & Urban Development.    Upon passage, these appropriations bills will be sent to the Senate as one Omnibus Appropriations bill.  Yesterday, I filed three amendments to the eight remaining appropriations bills, seeking funds for:  1.  East-West Center in the amount of $16.7M (their historical federal appropriation - omitted by the House GOP); 2.  Small Shipyard Grant Program in the amount of $7M (increasing the $3M appropriation to the historical $10M federal appropriation); 3.

We will fight for families struggling with high monthly bills like childcare, credit card fees, and cable bills. We will crack down on monopolies and the concentration of economic power that has led to higher prices for consumers, workers, and small business – and make sure Wall Street never endangers Main Street again.  ■ Build an economy that gives working Americans the tools to succeed in the 21st Century:: Americans deserve the chance to get the skills, tools, and knowledge to find a good-paying job or to move up in their career to earn a better living. We will commit to ""A Better Deal"" that provides new tax incentives to employers that invest in workforce training and education and make sure the rules of the economy support companies that focus on long-term growth, rather than short-term profits.

In Hawaii, CHIP, known as QUEST, builds on the foundation of Medicaid to cover children in working families who are not eligible for Medicaid yet lack access to affordable healthcare coverage.  149,452 children in Hawaii relied on Medicaid and CHIP at some point in FY16 to access the health care they need to be and stay healthy.  QUEST served 25,780 children in Hawaii.*  Medicaid and CHIP benefit Hawaii's most vulnerable children, with 78% living in or near poverty, 38% infants, toddlers and pre- schoolers and 39% children with disabilities.*  Bottomline:  Medicaid and CHIP (QUEST) are essential and critical to Hawaii and our children's health.  We must reauthorize CHIP before Sep 30th.  *Statistics courtesy of Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.","status",NA,NA,14,6,1,1,0,0,1,0

Uninsured young children are much less likely to see a doctor for preventive care (68% compared with 92% of insured children).   • Babies born with severe congenital problems may need costly initial and ongoing treatment. Opening up the possibility of capping annual and/or lifetime benefits could mean they reach their cap very early in life, leaving them vulnerable to being unable to afford lifesaving care later on. • Families could face tough choices if 17 million children under age 18 with pre-existing conditions are no longer guaranteed affordable health coverage from their private insurance�companies. Families with children with�conditions such as asthma, diabetes, autism,�and birth defects—all of which lead to�chronic health care needs—may in effect lose�insurance coverage. • Costs don’t go away when a child loses insurance. • An uninsured child costs the local community $2,100 more than a child insured by Medicaid.

(September 28, 2017) U.S. Representatives Steve Pearce (R-NM) along with U.S. Representatives Gwen Moore (D-WI), Don Young (R-AK), Rick Nolan (D-MN), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Colleen Hanabusa (D-HI), Denny Heck (D-WA), Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), and Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) introduced H.R. 3864, the reauthorization of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA), to increase access to safe and affordable housing for Native Americans across the nation.   “Prosperity and opportunity have eluded Native American families on tribal lands for too long. From increased access to quality housing, to lease-to-own programs aimed at providing rural tribes with the resources and flexibility to develop modern communities, NAHASDA assists tribes in meeting the unique housing challenges of each community with independence and self-choice. These reforms provide faster approval of projects, allowing tribes to focus on economic development and innovation rather than administrative processes. The bill also reduces inefficiencies within government spending, and ultimately aids some of the most vulnerable communities in our country with real opportunity to improve. I thank my colleagues in the House and Senate who have worked with me in a truly bipartisan, bicameral effort to reduce the burden on tribes and expand opportunity in Native American housing. By working across the aisle and with tribal leaders nationwide, we are helping to lay the foundation for real, concrete reforms needed in tribal communities,” stated Rep. Pearce.  “Congress must fulfill its responsibility to protect and improve the lives of all our Native populations, many of whom live in the poorest of conditions in this country.  The funding and reforms this bill provides will assist low-income Native individuals and families, including Native Hawaiians of my home state, Hawaii, construct and obtain adequate housing instrumental to an improved quality of life for this and future generations to come.  This legislation is the result of hard work by many, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the passage of this critical bill,” stated Rep. Hanabusa.  In addition to the introduction today in the House, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, introduced companion language in the Senate.   ""NAHASDA has a long history of bipartisan support, and I am pleased we are making progress on bipartisan, bicameral legislation to reauthorize this critical law, which has been held up for too long,” stated Sen. Udall. “Safe, well-built housing is a fundamental necessity for building strong, healthy communities, and this legislation will help ensure Tribal communities have quality housing while also driving further investments into Indian Country. Given the housing crisis in all of Indian Country, we must do all we can to make sure NAHASDA is fully authorized for all Native communities. I look forward to working with Congressman Pearce and my House and Senate colleagues to see this bill passed and signed into law.”  In 1996, NAHASDA was first signed into law to make housing assistance directly available to tribes through the Indian Housing Block Grant program. The program works to increase and strengthen the relationship between Indian tribes and the federal government.    ###","status",NA,NA,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

As New Democrats, we support smart, efficient public funding that leverages private capital where appropriate. These investments will create significant jobs in the short-term and helps U.S. competitiveness in the long-term. ● Immediate investments through tax reform and existing revenue streams: o Investing more money into the Highway Trust Fund: The Highway Trust Fund is the main mechanism for funding the nation’s highway and transit systems. We know it works, but it needs more money. In the short-term, Congress should fully fund the Highway Trust Fund for the full six years of the FAST Act.  o Pair a deemed repatriation with infrastructure funding: Currently, U.S. corporations keep more cash overseas than they do in the U.S. because our international tax system incentivizes it. We should fix our broken international tax system by ensuring everyone pays their fair share into the system and using money generated from a deemed repatriation to fund infrastructure back home in the U.S. This is a smart, bipartisan idea. ● Long term fixes for existing and new revenue streams: o Improve dedicated funding formulas to keep pace with needs. o With evolving technology and higher fuel efficiency, we need to pursue new, creative financing and funding solutions that move beyond the gas tax, which will continue to become a less effective and more regressive source of revenue.  o Where appropriate, encourage investments through regional partnerships and Public-Private partnerships. o Creating an Infrastructure Bank: An infrastructure bank can leverage taxpayer investments by multiples with private sector investments by providing loans or guarantees to state or local governments to finance qualified infrastructure projects. A federal infrastructure bank would create a large-scale infrastructure financing capability.   Fix it: Fix existing infrastructure deficiencies. ● Embrace a more expansive definition of infrastructure: o Infrastructure isn’t just roads, bridges, and airports. It’s also greener schools, a hardened electrical grid, upgraded water systems, broadband networks, and more. In the 21st century, we must recognize that there is a wide range of infrastructure that serves the public good that the government has a role to maintain and modernize. Modernizing these various systems are critical components of a thriving economy. ● Focus on improving existing infrastructure: o Instead of focusing entirely on new projects, we also need to first devote attention to improving our existing infrastructure. Repairing an existing bridge can have the same – or larger – economic impact as projects that create new products and capacities, and can often be completed on a faster timeline, making their impact more immediate.  Foster it: Foster innovation and community development around transportation projects. ● Streamline regulations and the permitting process: o Without sacrificing health, safety, labor or environmental standards, we need to foster a more efficient and effective process for beginning new projects and altering existing ones. The federal government plays a key role in creating a regulatory environment that ensures projects get off the ground quickly without compromising quality. However, many of the streamlining improvements in MAP-21 and the FAST Act, such as the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC) and expedited review of high priority projects, have yet to be implemented. Better coordination on these and other elements of federal requirements would increase incentives for new projects and help simplify existing burdens our communities and stakeholders face. ● Implementing Public-Private Partnerships Effectively and Responsibly: o We understand the importance of public-private partnerships and believe that encouraging private capital to invest in infrastructure can increase total infrastructure investment. At the same time, we understand that for many projects, especially in rural areas, public-private partnerships are not feasible, and thus alone cannot cover the investment necessary to bring our infrastructure into the 21st Century.  ● Encourage Innovation o The goal shouldn’t always be “shovel ready”—new projects should be smart, thoughtful infrastructure that our citizens need. When new infrastructure is developed, the federal government should prioritize projects that modernize our infrastructure through innovative design and technologies (e.g., smartgrid, high-speed rail). In addition to developing a cleaner and more efficient infrastructure grid, this will create more technology driven R&D and infrastructure jobs with long term effects on the economy and labor market. o Creating multiuse corridors, where infrastructure and industry needs to align, will speed the deployment of broadband and other transmission lines – reducing the cost and time to expand access to services while taking the best advantage of land. ● Community Development o Investment in our infrastructure must also foster community development. We must provide financing for community development of high cost superfund and brownfield sites, and we must invest in infrastructure projects, such as transit and housing, that have holistic community support. o Communities should be encouraged to take a holistic approach to transportation, housing, and economic development projects. Examples of this include transit oriented development and bike trails, which ensure that a community can fully take advantage of new capacity on roads and transit lines.  o The federal government should participate in the collection of data that will help states and metropolitan planning organizations improve transportation planning by ensuring new projects improve access to important destinations, such as jobs, education, health care, and food sources.","status",NA,NA,6,4,1,1,0,0,0,0

Cicilline (RI-1) in introducing legislation to ban the manufacture, possession, transfer, sale, or importation of bump stocks like the one used during the mass shooting earlier this week in Las Vegas.  ""It makes no sense to have state laws prohibiting fully-automatic weapons if one can purchase a bump stock and make a weapon fire like a fully-automatic weapon,"" said Rep. Hanabusa. ""There should be bipartisan support in Congress for common sense legislation like this and I am pleased to join my colleague, Rep. David Cicilline, in introducing the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act.  This Act will prohibit the sale, possession, or manufacture of bump stocks like those used in the Las Vegas mass shooting.""   BACKGROUND: The Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act will prohibit the sale of bump stocks, which were developed within the past decade to modify semi-automatic rifles. When replacing the fixed stock on a rifle, a bump stock allows the shooter to fire at a rate of 400 to 800 rounds per minute, replicating the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon (or “machine gun”) that propels multiple bullets with a single trigger pull.  Fully automatic firearms are highly-regulated.  Although many states, including Hawaii, prohibit the possession of fully-automatic firearms, the sale of bump stocks was approved by the U.S. Government in 2010.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has confirmed the Las Vegas shooter had 12 bump stocks attached to rifles in his room. Audio from the attack indicates he was able to fire at a rate of 9 bullets per second during an attack that lasted between 9 and 10 minutes.","status",NA,NA,77,16,10,13,0,0,0,3

Under new ""interim final"" rules issued Friday, October 6, 2017, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor are making it easier for employers to deny contraception coverage if they have a “religious or moral objection.”  The new rules also make it harder for women denied birth control coverage to get no-cost contraception directly from insurance companies.  According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation (https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-future-of-contraceptive-coverage/), the percentage of reproductive-age women who faced out-of-pocket costs for oral contraceptives dropped significantly by 2014, from 20% to just 4%.

Unlike the bipartisan tax bill passed in 1986, the Trump tax plan is hidden in a closed process so that House Democrats and U.S. taxpayers cannot see the details until shortly before the tax bill hits the House floor.  Consider how the 1986 tax bill (""Then"") was processed versus Trump's 2017 tax plan (""Now""):  Then:  Treasury Dept. releases tax proposal 11/84 Then:  Treasury Dept. revises tax proposal 5/85 Now:  GOP releases ""outline"" 3 weeks before bill text with            no revenue estimates  Then:  Treasury Dept. proposals 800 & 500 pages Now:  Outline 9 pages, no details  Then:  30 days public hearings Now:  No public hearings  Then:  More than 450 witnesses during public hearings Now:  Zero Witnesses  Then:  26 days of markup by Ways & Means Committee Now:  TBD, GOP says less than a week  Conclusion:  The current leadership and administration is not interested in transparency when it comes to the Trump tax plan.  The plan has been shrouded in secrecy and no Democrat has seen any legislative text to date.  In fact, many Republicans have admitted they have no details on the Trump tax plan.  Consider, for example:  Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY):  ""We have no details...All anyone wants to talk about, especially the business people and so forth, is the tax reform.  And I can't tell them anything, because I have no details.""  [Washington Post, 10/29/17].  Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN):  ""One of the things that typically you do in governing is you reach consensus but you use both sides of the aisle to do so..."" [Wall Street Journal, 10/27/17]  Whether you agree with the tax plan or not, in my opinion, it would be good for all Members of Congress (and their constituents) to see the plan, have hearings with witnesses and make informed decisions on behalf of the American taxpayers under a process John McCain referred to as  ""regular order.""

The bakery refused to bake the couple a cake because of the couple’s LGBT identity.  The brief was filed in the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. V. Colorado Civil Rights Commission.  A business open to the public must be open to everyone, regardless of the color of their skin or who they love.  As a member of the House LGBT Equality Caucus, I believe every person has the right to non-discriminatory public accommodations, whether it's receiving medical care, dining at a restaurant or shopping in a department store.  That is exactly what this case is about:  Denying minorities access to businesses that open their doors to the public.  I want to thank Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney and Senator Tammy Baldwin for leading this amici brief.  The fight for LGBT equality continues and I will do my part until the day all Americans are free from discrimination.  In 2012, Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery in Colorado open to the public refused to create a wedding cake for husbands-to-be David Mullins and Charlie Craig.  The owner of Masterpiece, Jack Phillips told the couple he would not design a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because his religious beliefs did not support same-sex marriage.  Mullins and Craig pursued their case against Masterpiece and won victories in the lower courts.  The Supreme Court will consider whether or not businesses open to the public can ignore state nondiscrimination laws if their motivation for discriminating is based on religious or moral disapproval of LGBT people.

The Republican tax plan also targets high cost-of-living states like Hawaii by eliminating key deductions, such as the state and local income tax deduction, medical deduction and student loan expense deduction, while limiting the amount of mortgage and property tax deductions.

Unfortunately, although Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner for years to keep children healthy, HR 3922 is a highly partisan Republican bill that cuts the Prevention and Public Health Fund, sabotages the ACA and raises Medicare premiums for seniors.  The Democratic caucus tried to substitute a bipartisan bill without the three offsets contained in the GOP bill, but the Rules Committee refused.   Here are statements by constituency groups opposing HR 3922:  AARP    ""We strongly oppose section 403 of the “CHAMPIONING HEALTH KIDS ACT” (H.R. 3922) that unfairly and inappropriately offsets some of the program’s costs by shifting those costs onto older Americans in Medicare.  Section 403 of the HEALTHY KIDS Act creates a new bracket for high-income Medicare, requiring enrollees to pay 100 percent of the Medicare Part B premium, as well as requiring an increased surcharge for enrollees on their Part D plans.  Due to this harmful cost-shift onto Medicare beneficiaries, we are opposed to H.R. 3922 and urge you to vote NO. … Medicare does not have a payroll cap and higher income seniors have been paying more into the Medicare program throughout their working lives.  These high costs risk driving better off seniors out of the Medicare program, and undermining support for Medicare.""  National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare   “The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare urges you to pass H.R. 3922, the HEALTHY KIDS Act of 2017, without offsetting part of the cost of the bill by requiring some older Medicare beneficiaries to pay 100 percent of the cost of the Medicare Part B premium.  To that end, we urge you to oppose H.R. 3922 and to support the Democratic Alternative which would reauthorize CHIP and Community Health Centers without taking resources from the Medicare program.”  Center for Medicare Advocacy  “We strongly oppose higher income-related premiums for Medicare beneficiaries as an offset to the CHIP Reauthorization bill.  Higher-income Medicare beneficiaries already pay more in monthly premiums, as well as an additional tax on their Social Security benefits dedicated to the Medicare program.  … These higher payments already risk driving better off seniors out of the Medicare program, thereby undermining support for Medicare as a social insurance program on which everyone can rely.”  Other groups opposed HR 3922's offset slashing the prevention fund by $6.35 billion over 10 years:  American Lung Association  “We oppose the current pay-fors for the legislation [CHAMPIONS Act], including the use of both current and future money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to pay for CHIP.  Raiding funding for public health will negatively impact children’s health.  Losing public health investments aimed at preventing illness and injury is likely to cause children to be sicker and our nation’s health care costs to skyrocket.  Our nation will never get costs under control if we don’t invest in keeping children and families healthy in the first place.”  March of Dimes  “The March of Dimes opposes the decision to fund important public health priorities, such as community health centers and the National Health Service Corps, with monies from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), a choice that simply transfers funding from one important health program to another.  The siphoning of funds from the PPHF will have serious implications for both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s budget and the valuable programs it supports, many of which seek to improve maternal and child health.”  American Heart Association  “On behalf of the American Heart Association and our more than 30 million volunteers and supporters, we urge you not to divert $6.35 billion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to pay for Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation (CHAMPIONS) Act of 2017.  The Prevention Fund represents an unprecedented investment in programs that can help Americans adopt healthy habits and ultlimately drive down rising costs associated with Cardiovascular disease (CVD).” American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network “We … are opposed to the diversion of $6.35 billion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to pay for … the Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation (CHAMPIONS) Act of 2017. … The Prevention Fund provides the first-ever, reliable national funding stream for public health, while creating jobs, bending the health-care cost curve, and prioritizing disease prevention in order to reduce the burden of chronic diseases like cancer.  Specifically, the Prevention Fund has made possible a highly successful Tips from Former Smokers cessation campaign to raise awareness and shift key attitudes and beliefs about the harms of tobacco use.  … For this reason, we should support successful programs such as the Tips from Former Smokers rather than undercut our progress with these proposed cuts.”  The Prevention Fund supports grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to every state.  The funds support vaccinations, infectious disease detection and prevention and chronic disease prevention.

Hirono and the Hawaii Congressional Delegation introduced the Sustainable Fishing Workforce Protection Act, legislation that would address concerns about the status of foreign workers in Hawaii’s longline fishing fleet.   “This bill provides necessary protections for foreign fishermen and ensures the continued viability of Hawaii’s longline fishing fleet, which is important to our culture,” said Senator Hirono. “Throughout this process, I have worked with a range of stakeholders and will continue to do so as we work to pass this legislation.”   “The Sustainable Fishing Workforce Protection Act addresses longstanding allegations in the Hawaii fishing industry regarding the treatment of foreign workers on longline commercial fishing vessels homeported in Hawaii,” said Representative Colleen Hanabusa.  “I am optimistic this legislative framework will allow Congress to better define the employer-employee relationship between boat owners and foreign fisherman such that each side understands their rights and obligations.  I look forward to working with the rest of the Hawaii delegation and my colleagues in the House as we move this bill forward into law.”    “This legislation is about providing safety, protecting human rights, and restoring dignity to the foreign crewmen working in Hawaii’s fishing fleet,” said Senator Brian Schatz. “I will continue to work with our congressional delegation to pass this bill and improve the working conditions on all our vessels.”   “For years, disjointed laws have left foreign fishermen working off our shores without federal protections or status, and at risk for inhumane conditions and human rights abuses,” said Representative Tulsi Gabbard. “This legislation will increase employer accountability, strengthen federal oversight, and improve working conditions for these workers that contribute to our local economy.”      Senator Hirono introduced the bill, S. 2071, in the Senate with Senator Schatz. Representative Hanabusa introduced the companion legislation, H.R. 4224, in the House with Representative Gabbard.   The Sustainable Fishing Workforce Protection Act would:   Provide foreign fishermen in the Hawaii fleet with visas that will allow them to transit to and from and work legally in the U.S.   Establish a baseline of responsibilities for employers by outlining the components of labor agreements that they and the foreign workers must agree to governing wages and other compensation; requiring that the terms of those agreements be enforceable in U.S. court or by voluntary arbitration; and requiring that signed copies of the agreements be kept on file at relevant federal and state agencies.   Clarify oversight responsibilities of federal agencies with respect to health and safety issues for the Hawaii fishing fleet.   ###","status",NA,NA,7,4,0,1,0,0,0,1

The tax plan provides substantial tax cuts for the very rich...a tax cut that is neither just or fair.  History shows that tax cuts for the wealthy do not raise the overall economic growth rate; 3. Many low and middle class income households will receive little and some will face higher taxes; 4.  Eliminating the state and local income or sales tax deduction and limiting the property tax deduction will be regressive, hurting states and localities strapped for cash. 5.

From 1941 through 1945, U.S. service members fought alongside allied service members on land, in the air, and at sea throughout the Pacific Theater.  Over 150,000 U.S. and allied lives were lost in the Pacific War.  “This memorial will honor those who valiantly served our country in the Pacific Theater, share their history with future generations and provide a place for loved ones to mourn those they lost in the war” said Congresswoman Hanabusa.  “I can think of no better place for a Pacific War memorial than at Pearl Harbor, where the USS Arizona commemorates the entry of the United States into World War II and the USS Missouri memorializes the site where World War II formally ended.  Admiral Joe Vasey, who served in the Pacific War and who turned 100 years old earlier this year, deserves the credit for this memorial.  Admiral Vasey dedicated his life to promoting peace throughout the Pacific and I am committed to honoring him and his vision for this memorial.  Finally, I thank Congressman Bishop, who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources and also serves on Armed Services.  Congressman Bishop understands the debt of gratitude and recognition we owe our veterans.  The Valor of the Pacific falls under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources and I look forward to working with Chairman Bishop on the passage of this important bill.”  “This legislation will memorialize the brave service members who defended our country in the Pacific Theater,” said Congressman Bishop.  “I commend Rep. Hanabusa for her commitment to honoring and remembering our nation’s World War II veterans for generations to come.”  “This memorial to American and Allied veterans and the fallen of World War II Pacific Theater battles is essential to remember and honor their sacrifices.  I thank Congresswoman Hanabusa for her efforts to make this memorial a reality,” said Alma Grocki, Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret), Board Member, Pacific Historic Parks.  Admiral Lloyd R. ‘Joe’ Vasey served aboard the USS Gunnel in the Pacific during World War II, under John S. McCain, Jr., father of U.S. Senator John McCain, and has advocated for the establishment of this memorial.  Admiral Vasey founded the Pacific Forum CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies), a nonprofit, private, foreign policy research instituted focused on the Asia-Pacific.   His military service includes: chief of strategic plans and policies at U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters, secretary to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; deputy director of the U.S. National Military Command Center in the Pentagon; and chief of staff for Commander U.S. 7th Fleet.  Admiral Vasey turned 100 years old on January 31, 2017.    ####","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepColleenHanabusa/photos/a.170632829644808.33121.169979129710178/1773017189406356/?type=3",NA,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

According to the CBO, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) requires that new legislation enacted during a term of Congress not collectively increase estimated deficits.  The OMB is required to keep 5 and 10 year scorecards and if a scorecard indicates an increase in the deficit, OMB is required to order a sequestration to eliminate the overage.  Since the GOP Tax Bill would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over a 10-year window, unless there is legislation offsetting the increase, Congress would be required to reduce spending by $136 billion in 2018 alone (there is a positive balance of $14 billion in 2018), with subsequent reductions calculated in each calendar year between 2019 and 2027.  While Medicare can only be reduced 4 percentage points (~$25B/year), $111 billion would have to come from other mandatory accounts.  Some large accounts, like Social Security, are exempt, making it very difficult to implement the full extent of the PAYGO law.  Bottomline, if the GOP Tax Plan passes, there will be required cuts to other mandatory programs between 2018 and 2027 absent offsetting legislation.","status",NA,NA,7,3,1,0,0,1,0,0

The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.L. 111–203, H.R. 4173, commonly referred to as ""Dodd–Frank"") was signed into federal law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010.  Dodd-Frank created the CFPB.  2.     Congress was very clear through the inclusion of express language in Dodd-Frank to the effect that the Deputy Director, appointed by the Director, ""shall"" serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the Director.  3.     While the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) generally allows the President to fill federal vacancies, in the case of the CFPB, Congress expressly elected to not apply the FVRA so as to maintain the independence of the CFPB.   Instead, Congress provided specific language providing the ""Deputy Director"" would be acting in the event the Director was absent.  4.     When Mulvaney was a member of Congress and on the House Financial Services Committee, he called the CFPB a ""joke.""  He was also the original cosponsor of a bill designed to eliminate the CFPB.  5.

""With a potentially far-reaching dimension, elements in both the House and Senate bills could constrain the ability of states and local governments to levy their own taxes, pressuring them to limit spending on health care, education, public transportation and social services.""

""All of this is taking shape at such extraordinary velocity, absent the usual analyses and hearings, that even the most savvy Washington lobbyist cannot be fully certain of the implications.""  The House GOP has allowed no hearings with testimony on the GOP Tax Bill.   4.  ""By 2027, people making $40,000 to $50,000 would pay a combined $5.3 billion more in taxes, while the group earning $1 million or more would get a $5.8 billion cut, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office.""  https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/reconciliationrecommendationssfc.pdf  5.

For example, H.R. 1699, Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2017, sounds good, but in fact it exempts manufactured housing salespeople offering credit to homebuyers from CFPB consumer protection oversight.  The irony here is that recent studies confirm those buying manufactured homes are typically financially vulnerable and need more consumer protections, not less.  Additionally, H.R. 1699 raises the interest rate trigger for Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) to 10%, meaning sellers can charge more interest without triggering consumer protection oversight.

This bill extends the probationary period from one (1) year to two (2) years for federal employees in the competitive service and the Senior Executive Service.    During the probationary period, federal employees are at-will employees with essentially no due-process or appeal rights.  After the probationary period, due process protections ensure the integrity of the federal civil service by preventing its politicization.  Without any indication federal agencies desired an additional year of probation, the GOP proposes to increase the probationary period to 2 years.  To make matters worse, under this bill, the 2-year probationary period does not necessarily begin at the time a federal worker is hired.  Instead, the probationary period would end on the date that is 2 years after the date on which required formal training is completed or a license is required and obtained.  For those federal workers that need a license or go through a formal training program, the probationary period is actually longer and, perhaps, much longer than 2 years.  After the current 1 year probation period, federal employers may still dismiss poor performers through a due process that includes notice, an opportunity to respond and appeal rights.  So why the need to increase the probationary period without due process rights to 2 years?","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepColleenHanabusa/photos/a.170632829644808.33121.169979129710178/1802029616505113/?type=3",NA,8,4,3,0,0,0,1,8

This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeks the views of the public on the Department's proposed rescission of those portions of the regulations. Essentially, the proposed rule rescinds parts of the Department's 2011 Tip Regulations that clarify tips are the property of an employee, regardless of whether an employer takes a tip credit against its obligation to pay the minimum wage or pays the tipped worker the full minimum wage. The proposed rule reverses the Department's position of more than 40 years and could impact up to 1.3 million tipped workers. The proposed rule means employers could be allowed to pocket workers' tips as long as the employer pays the worker a cash wage of at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25.","link","https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/05/2017-25802/tip-regulations-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act-flsa","federalregister.gov",2,3,6,0,0,0,0,2

You can only sign up through December 15th. Enrolling is easy but there’s not much time left before the final deadline of December 15 for 2018 coverage through www.HealthCare.gov.   2. Coverage could be cheaper than you think. Last year, 8 in 10 people qualified for financial help to make their monthly premiums more affordable. Most people can find plans with monthly premiums less than $75 and many find plans for less.   3. Shop and save - plans and prices change every year. If you had coverage through www.HealthCare.gov for 2017, you should go back to update your information and compare your options for 2018. Every year, plans and prices change, you could save money by switching to a new plan that still meets your needs.   4. Free help is available.
