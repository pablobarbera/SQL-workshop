Before leaving office, President Obama managed to take a final swipe at Missourians way of life with ‚ÄúDirector‚Äôs Order No. 219,‚Äù a last-minute regulation that banned lead ammunition and fishing tackle on federal lands. In other words, President Obama‚Äôs rule would not have allowed you to take shotgun shells or fishing sinkers with you to hunt in Mark Twain National Forest or fish at Clearwater Lake.   On February 7th, I led a bipartisan letter with over 60 of my colleagues to President Trump asking him to overturn the ban. You see, in Missouri, we know how to be good stewards of the land God has given us, and we do not need the federal government monitoring our movements while we enjoy creation.  Last week, my friend Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, acknowledged the concerns in my letter to President Trump and signed an order to overturn the rule.    It was a complete overreach by the Obama administration to decide what type of ammunition or fishing tackle you carry while exploring the great outdoors of South Central Missouri. In typical Washington, D.C. fashion, President Obama wanted to show Missourians that he knew what was best for us. Fortunately, we have a new president who understands the people and trusts us to tell him what we need, not the other way around.   We have all seen President Trump‚Äôs great work thus far, undoing the damage of President Obama‚Äôs executive actions and appointing the right people like Secretary Zinke to do the same thing. After eight years of Obama‚Äôs overreach, whether it is something as big as Obamacare or as small as the fishing tackle you pack on a weekend trip with your family, I am proud to work with President Trump to defend southern Missouri‚Äôs way of life.   http://www.missourinet.com/2017/02/13/missouri-congressman-jason-smith-asks-president-trump-to-revoke-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-order-its-absolutely-ridiculous/  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/02/new-interior-secretary-zinke-reverses-last-minute-obama-lead-ammunition-ban.html","link","http://www.missourinet.com/2017/02/13/missouri-congressman-jason-smith-asks-president-trump-to-revoke-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-order-its-absolutely-ridiculous/","missourinet.com",144,58,72,7,0,4,0,14

President Trump's action today stops these countries from selling low-quality steel.  Most importantly, we are supporting American steelworkers. These are some of the hardest working people in America. They rely on the steel industry's strength so they have the opportunity to work, pay their bills and put meals on the table for their families.   I am proud to stand with President Trump as we fight for American jobs, the industries in our great nation that create jobs and the hard working people that wake up every day and do these jobs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjasonsmith/photos/a.544883395571867.1073741828.544741092252764/1401619519898246/?type=3",NA,13,10,2,0,0,0,0,1

Owner Mike Rust showed me the company's original account books from the 1940s, and it is incredible how much the cost of benefits and taxes has grown as a percentage of expenses since that time.    These small business owners also believe that we need to make it easier for people to have a good job and work their way off of the social safety net rather than feel trapped in a cycle of poverty.  Many people in poverty feel they cannot afford to earn a raise or seek a better job because they fear they will immediately lose their benefits.  I could not agree more - the only way to truly change lives and opportunities is to break the cycle of dependency.  We can do this by making the exit ramps from these programs more gradual so that we do not disincentivize people getting raises or better jobs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjasonsmith/photos/a.726854490708089.1073741887.544741092252764/1446773768716154/?type=3",NA,12,8,0,0,0,0,0,2

Farmers in southeast and south central Missouri should be focused on taking care of their land and raising their crops, NOT worried about how much health insurance is going to cost. In addition to voting to repeal Obamacare multiple times, I have worked with my colleagues in the House to pass several pieces of legislation, one in particular that would help farmers like John.   It's called the Small Business Health Fairness Act and was passed with bipartisan support by the House. If passed by the Senate, the legislation would help farmers, small business owners and many other folks all across southeast and south central Missouri lower the cost of their premiums by banning together to buy health insurance with a larger group.

Rocky is a former Marine and was held as an Iranian hostage for 444 days. For over 30 days he was tied to a chair, his hands tied down to the chair arm and his feet tied to the chair leg. In 400 days, he was only allowed outside 7 times. He talked about how the Iranians stripped away the hostages' freedom, pride, and dignity, but shared the one thing that helped him survive - remembering his past and the simple things we take for granted. Things like his mother making pancakes in her iron skillet, how the batter smelled, the bubbles it made, the can of maple syrup, the slice of butter she put on each pancake as she placed them onto the plate‚Ä¶    As we approach the holiday season, Rocky's story is a strong reminder of those who have sacrificed for our freedoms. From missed holidays with their families, to being held captive, I pray you will pause to say a prayer for everyone who has fought or is fighting for our freedom.   Rocky's story is a great example of appreciating the little things, even during the hardest times. After the U.S. paid a ransom and he was released, Rocky came home and worked for Anheuser Busch for 34 years.   I am proud that President Trump decertified Obama's Iran Nuclear ""Deal"" and is moving forward with a new, strong strategy that no longer puts Americans at risk.

Al Green, went so far as to offer a motion on the House Floor today that called for the impeachment of our President.

We've had major accomplishments like the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct and given our military the biggest pay raise in 8 years, but in 2018, I hope the Senate will get busy and make sure none of our work in the House continues to get bogged down and stuck in the Senate because of the rules of the Swamp.  #StuckInTheSenate","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjasonsmith/photos/a.544883395571867.1073741828.544741092252764/1645734408820088/?type=3",NA,31,25,7,4,8,1,0,8

One of the biggest concerns people across southeast and south central Missouri had with Obamacare was the individual mandate that forced them to buy something they didn‚Äôt even want ‚Äì government rationed healthcare.  While we continue to wait for the Senate to pass the full repeal we advanced in the U.S. House, I‚Äôm happy to say that we are ending the year with a repeal of the individual mandate and in 2018, people won‚Äôt be punished for their personal healthcare choices.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repjasonsmith/photos/a.544883395571867.1073741828.544741092252764/1645742432152619/?type=3",NA,67,59,9,1,0,0,3,18

I was honored to have President Trump in our home state and tell him why folks in our area are most in need of federal tax relief. Together, we have repealed $4.1 billion worth of regulations, jumpstarted America‚Äôs economy with tax cuts, invested in our domestic energy resources and brought illegal immigration levels down to the lowest rate since 1971.

Agriculture is the biggest driver of Missouri‚Äôs economy, and one of my most important fights has been to keep the government off of your land and out of your family farm.   Over the past year, we‚Äôve been able to repeal harmful regulations like Waters of the United States which allowed Obama‚Äôs EPA to regulate every drop of water on your land and also ended the practice of ""sue and settle"" where radical environmental groups sued the government winning tax dollars and new regulations. Most recently, the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct was signed into law allowing our farmers to keep more of their money to invest in their farms and families.
