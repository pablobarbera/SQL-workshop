I agree with the President that our first order of business has to be maintaining national security. At its heart, this executive order represents a temporary pause to make sure we have adequate vetting procedures in place to prevent terror attacks against Americans on U.S. soil. That said, I believe we should work to maintain our status as a welcoming, sovereign nation for the unjustly persecuted and for those in countries of conflict who have risked their lives to support our armed forces.

This legislation is designed to make sure that digital communications stored by companies like Google, Yahoo, and Dropbox are afforded the same Constitutional protections as written and in-person communications. As it stands, agencies can gain access to emails and other digital files that are more than 90 days old by issuing subpoenas to tech. companies (clearly, a low threshold). This legislation updates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to require law enforcement agencies to obtain a probable cause, judge-issued warrant before gaining access to digital information stored in the cloud.  This is the first major update to our digital privacy laws in more than three decades. At the rate that technology is changing, we have to do better than that. In this digital age, we have so many opportunities to improve our economy, expand industry, and connect in new and innovative ways, but that shouldn't come at the cost of compromised privacy. The way we protect information should reflect the way we share and store information. Electronic communications deserve the same protection under the 4th Amendment as other forms of communications, and I think the Email Privacy Act sets that standard.","status",NA,NA,33,31,1,0,0,0,0,0

The strike last night was proportional, given Assad's heinous acts against innocent men, women, and children earlier this week. Russian forces were notified before the strikes, and extreme precautions were taken to protect U.S. forces against any retaliatory attacks from Russia or Syria. Our military men and women took extraordinary measures to avoid casualties to civilians and airfield personnel. The purpose of the strike was to keep Assad from ever using chemical weapons again.

When it comes to government spending, we‚Äôre facing some difficult decisions. We have to find ways to adequately support our national defense, border security, education, and health care priorities without mortgaging our future.  This spending bill does make progress in some areas.   I'm supporting it because I believe it addresses some of the obstacles that folks in the First District are facing. Among other things, It maintains full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and at my urging, directs the Army Corps of Engineers to release the Brandon Road Study and provide quarterly updates about steps being taken to prevent further spread of the Asian Carp. It plusses up funding for Alzheimer‚Äôs and other research through the National Institute of Health and provides an additional $650 million to address the growing opioid and heroin epidemic.   That said, we are teetering on the edge of fiscal collapse. As I said, this piece of legislation moves us in the right direction, but our FY 18 Budget has to include real, conservative reforms that reflect our fiscal reality.

Selflessness-willingness to sacrifice for others-is the mark of leadership, and in the U.S., we lead.   But service isn't just an obligation, it's an opportunity-a chance to be part of something bigger than ourselves. My father, like so many men of his generation, served in the Navy during World War II, and I learned from his example that there is honor in putting family, community, and freedom before yourself.   That's why in 1969, in the middle of the Vietnam War, I joined the Marine Corps and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. It was a difficult time in our nation's history, but the men and women who served with me persevered. They gave their all for the mission, for their country, and for each other. That's what leaders do.  Now, once again, we're facing a difficult time in our nation. We can choose to ignore the dangers we face and placate the enemies of freedom, or we can face them head on.  Make no mistake-no one is more invested in peace than our men and women in uniform, because no one takes the risks, makes the sacrifices, and bears the cost of battle like they do. Those rows of white headstones across the bridge in Arlington serve as a reminder of that. We owe them more than gratitude-we owe them every effort at peace.   On Memorial Day in 1982, President Reagan said that, ""war will not come again, other young men will not have to die, if we will speak honestly of the dangers that confront us and remain strong enough to meet those dangers. It's not just strength or courage that we need, but understanding and a measure of wisdom as well.""   Those are words we should heed. But to be honest about the future, we have to be honest about our past.  We can start this Memorial Day by taking the time in cities and small towns all across the United States to honor the fallen. That's our obligation: not just to remember, but to carry the torch of freedom forward so that no Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine will have made that sacrifice in vain.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJackBergman/photos/a.1716206728670215.1073741828.1714470218843866/1788310048126549/?type=3",NA,111,52,14,12,0,1,6,0

Our federal immigration laws are designed to keep criminals and wrong-doers from carrying out acts of violence in our communities but for those laws to work, they have to be enforced. Unfortunately, local governments across the country have endangered the safety and well-being of their citizens by adopting policies that thwart federal law enforcement and protect criminals‚Äîcriminals like the one responsible for the death of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco and the one responsible for the death of 21-year-old Sarah Root.

The word itself invokes images of brave U.S. Service Members proudly fighting for the American way in Iwo Jima, Vietnam, Fallujah. And yes, their sacrifice is without a doubt the foundation for which we have built this great Republic, but service is not a litmus test for patriotism.   No, it‚Äôs so much more than that. It‚Äôs a commitment to a principle, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.   It is a fierce loyalty to this principle that has lighted, and keeps glowing, the fire of American patriotism. That no matter our disagreements, however vast they may be, we are all free men with the power to pursue happiness.

The underlying policy was an Administration change, not one legislated by Congress, and I believe President Trump and his Administration can and will reverse that policy‚Äîwithout any need for Congress to step in. I have full faith that President Trump and Secretary Mattis, who originally urged Congress not to pursue this amendment, will ensure that our government is NOT funding any sort of medical procedures for transgender individuals in the military. The NDAA bill that passed the House last week is about military readiness, and as we work to rebuild our military‚Äôs strength, it is important that we are working closely with President Trump‚Äôs Administration, and most importantly Secretary Mattis, on the details of the path forward.
