These tests are a brazen violation of UN Security Council resolutions and should be brought to an end. The quick response from our new administration makes clear that the United States is serious about holding Iran accountable for their growing aggression and continued support for terrorism around the world.","link","http://go.usa.gov/x96pF","go.usa.gov",396,55,28,22,0,3,0,16

Adam Coffey, an enterprising and inquisitive 8 year old from San Clemente in my district, was learning about The Library of Congress  and was disappointed when he discovered that he had to be 16 years old in order to get a Readers Card to use the Library. Frustrated and saddened, he wrote a letter to the Librarian of Congress asking why children as old as 8 couldn't be allowed to use the resources of the world's largest library.  To his surprise, the Librarian of Congress (Dr. Hayden) wrote back, inviting him to come to Washington to become the Librarian for a Day and to hear his ideas for how the Library could be more accessible to children like him. At the end of the day, Dr. Hayden announced she'd be creating a children's Reader Card so he and other young Americans with curious minds can have the opportunity to use all the Library has to offer.   During his visit to Washington, I met Adam and his family to discuss what we can do to help more young Americans succeed. He and his brother even got to join me for a speech and votes on the House floor!  His energy and fervor for learning are an inspiration for us all. No matter how young or how small, always believe in yourself. You do have the power to change the world!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/darrellissa/photos/a.140015987992.104938.19463427992/10155084884472993/?type=3",NA,235,32,24,37,0,1,1,0
