For all of us here, that‚Äôs a no-brainer. But each day I find myself asking that of the president-elect.  Last night, we watched President Obama say farewell to the country he served. For the past eight years parts of our country disparaged him and some of our colleagues fought him tooth and nail at the expense of their constituents. But each day we were assured that our outgoing president put this country and our interests first.  President-elect Trump serves himself.  Yesterday, several news sources reported a possibility of continuing exchange of information between Russia and Trump campaign officials during the election.  So in the face of yet another troubling revelation that further sullies the ground on which his loyalty to America stands on - I have questions:  Is our president-elect willing to sacrifice personal gain for the good of this great nation?   When will we find out if he has fulfilled his legal responsibility to pay taxes like millions of American‚Äôs do?   How can we be sure that our interests will take precedent if we don‚Äôt know if they ever have?  Will the White House serve as Trump Tower South?  The actions and words of the President of the United States have a loud and reverberating effect through the world economy and the international political system.   To date, president-elect Trump‚Äôs promises to America have been hollow and his actions self-serving.   Donald Trump does not merely offer an alternative direction for our nation; he offers to use the Presidency primarily for his personal benefit.   When given opportunity to set these concerns aside, he scoffs at his critics and embraces our nation‚Äôs enemies.   Instead of making reasonable attempts to reassure the American public, whom he will soon swear to protect, he gaslights us with tweets, mockery, and lies.  In the past, we‚Äôve seen the term Un-American used to indict members of the public executing their civil liberties.   Anti-war advocates protesting for peace have been called un-American;  Civil rights leaders standing against discrimination have been called un-American (ask Jeff Sessions);  Professional athletes taking a knee to acknowledge sordid realities within our justice system are deemed un-American;   And comedians and pastors alike for using their microphones to criticize our nation.   But quite frankly, dissent is American.   Protest is American.   Criticism is American.   Healthy skepticism toward our national intelligence is American - disparaging and discrediting them is not.  Working with foreign powers to ensure peace is not only American, but also presidential - inviting a foreign power to compromise the cyber security of private citizens is not.  Empowering Americans to become involved in the political process, take action and even be critical of you is American ‚Äì attacking them when they call untruths and inciting your supporters to do the same is not.  Of these reasons and a host of others, I simply ask‚Äîat what point do the actions of our next president Donald Trump, meet the threshold of Un-American?","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBonnie/videos/1637978583171173/",NA,110,17,57,23,0,2,0,0

The Global Gag rule stops US foreign aid from going to any NGO that either provides reproductive services, or even talks about those services, with its patients as an option for family planning.

The most important thing Congress can do is create an independent commission to investigate what happened in the 2016 election and provide recommendations on what we can do to prevent such foreign interference from happening again.  For that reason, I have cosponsored the bipartisan Protecting Our Democracy Act (https://goo.gl/KBubzf).   Additionally, I joined all my Democratic colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in signing a letter (https://goo.gl/O3THzr) urging Chairman, Representative Jason Chaffetz, to launch an investigation into Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn‚Äôs ties to the Russian government. Any investigation must be independent and bipartisan, which is why I joined my colleagues in urging Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from any Justice Department investigation into Lt. Gen. Flynn and Trump campaign‚Äôs ties to Russia.  Foreign interference in our elections is a grave threat to our democracy. We must get to the bottom of what happened so we can hold the appropriate people accountable and prevent it from happening again. I stand with you and I will not stop pushing for a full investigation until one takes place.  Again, don't hesitate to contact my office to let me know what you're thinking.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBonnie/photos/a.1398158090486558.1073741828.1398082073827493/1652831831685848/?type=3",NA,304,62,40,39,2,0,0,0

It is merely a gift to the insurance companies and the rich at the expense of hard-working families. It flies in the face of, not only, what the American public needs but, what they have asked for.   It has been made very clear that the GOP promise for a ‚Äúfar better and far less expensive‚Äù plan rings hollow. The ramifications of this ACA repeal are clear and this bill: - drives up health care costs while lining the pockets of insurance companies;  - denies millions of women access to cancer screenings, birth control, and STD testing and treatment;  - and will ultimately lead to millions of Americans losing their coverage.

By the age of 14 she was acting as her grandfather‚Äôs interpreter so he could participate in their local Democratic Party caucus.  Motivated by his activism and the need for social progress, she dedicated herself to education and her community eventually becoming a Community Nutrition Educator at the University of Minnesota.  She immersed herself in politics by managing state and local races before she assumed the role of Director of Policy & Initiatives of the Women Organizing Women Network, an association which advocate for women from East Africa to take on political and civic leadership positions.  Committed to unity and justice, Ilhan is focused on advancing important issues, including raising the minimum wage to $15/hour, closing the opportunity gap, fighting for environmental justice, and racial equity.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act and its expanded coverage and subsidies the uninsured rate of women of reproductive age dropped by 36% in 2 years.   TrumpCare seeks to roll back Medicaid expansion and eliminate subsidies, which will lead to fewer women with access to affordable, comprehensive care.   Currently under ACA, couples have to file taxes jointly to receive a tax credit‚Äîunless they are victims of domestic abuse, domestic violence, or spousal abandonment.   TrumpCare doesn't account for this and requires all couples to file jointly to receive a tax credit, without exception. Women are disproportionately affected by this requirement.   The implementation of TrumpCare would also lead to less access to birth control coverage and other services for low-income women (and other groups) by defunding Planned Parenthood.   As I‚Äôve said before and will say again - If this is the Trump Republican‚Äôs gift to us in celebration Women‚Äôs History Month, I hope they kept the receipt.","video","https://www.facebook.com/HouseDemocrats/videos/10154989080468548/",NA,148,14,0,11,0,0,3,13

Currently, schools receiving voucher money are prohibited from discriminating against students based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.   My amendment would add sexual orientation and gender identity. This committee is clearly divided on the merits of private school vouchers. But, to those who believe vouchers are necessary to provide opportunities to students in struggling schools, surely we must require that those opportunities be available to all students.   Yet, under current law, LGBT students can be denied admission, expelled, or otherwise treated negatively just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. For a federally funded program, that is unacceptable.  LGBT youths are particularly likely to be bullied or physically assaulted at school, making it particularly essential that we ensure this vulnerable population is protected from discrimination. This amendment would simply give them the same protections we give other students participating in the DC voucher program.  Some of my colleagues may have concerns about interfering with private institutions. But, these schools make a choice to participate in the DC voucher program. If they don‚Äôt want to abide by non-discrimination principles, they are free to not accept federal money. It is entirely reasonable to expect schools that accept taxpayer dollars, including from the LGBT taxpayers in all of our districts, to spend that money in a non-discriminatory way.  Just earlier this year, President Trump announced he will keep in place President Obama‚Äôs executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.   This decision reflects a growing bipartisan consensus that those who choose to accept federal money should not use those funds to discriminate.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join me in applying this logic to the DC voucher program by supporting this amendment.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/03/12/gop-lawmakers-refuse-to-protect-lgbt-students-and-those-with-disabilities-in-school-voucher-bill/?utm_term=.8a5811d8b0fc","washingtonpost.com",65,6,22,4,0,0,0,16

At the age of 10, Steinem became her mentally ill mother‚Äôs caregiver until she left to attend Smith College. At Smith, she studied government, a non-traditional choice for a woman at that time. . After finishing her degree in 1956, Steinem received a fellowship to study in India. She wrote for Indian publications, and was influenced by Gandhian activism. She first worked for Independent Research Service and then established a career for herself as a freelance writer. . In the late 1960s, she helped create New York magazine, and wrote a column on politics for the publication. Steinem became more engaged in the women's movement after reporting on an abortion hearing given by the radical feminist group known as the Redstockings. . She expressed her feminist views in such essays as ""After Black Power, Women's Liberation."" . In 1971 Steinem joined other prominent feminists, such as Bella Abzug and Betty Friedan, in forming the National Women's Political Caucus, which worked on behalf of women's issues. She also took the lead in launching the pioneering, feminist Ms. magazine. It began as an insert in New York magazine but its first independent issue appeared in January 1972. . Under her direction, the magazine tackled important topics, including domestic violence. Ms. became the first national publication to feature the subject on its cover in 1976. .

Her love for music began at a very young age on the streets of Newark when she began playing piano at the age of 7, and by the time she was a teenager she had begun performing as pianist and sometimes singing at a number of venues, including Piccadilly Club and the Newark Airport USO. . Vaughn attended both Newark‚Äôs East Side High School, and Newark Art High School- America‚Äôs first Arts Magnet High School. . Vaughn ventured into limelight at the age of 18 when she was dared by a friend to audition for Amateur Night at the Apollo and awarded first prize.  Little did Vaughn know, singer Bill Eckstine was in attendance, and she would soon join his band along jazz greats like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. . Vaughn was loved by many for her unconventional Jazz music, which included pop music and went on to make many more hit records like ‚ÄúMr. Wonderful‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhatever Lola Wants.‚Äù Her voice was one thing that ventured across  genre lines and acknowledged by many, including Ella Fitzgerald, as the ‚Äúbest singing talent.‚Äù . Vaughn stood out from many artist because despite her aging her voice never lost its perfection, and she could scat like no other.  Most notably her rendition of the Duke Ellington Song Book 1 and 2, has been described as some of the best music up to date.  Vaughn never lost momentum and continued performing at A-list events and venues well into her sixties, until she passed in 1990 at the age of sixty-six. . The life and legacy of Sarah reminds us as to why the Arts are so important, and why I will continue to support investing in the humanities!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBonnie/photos/a.1398158090486558.1073741828.1398082073827493/1666171390351892/?type=3",NA,16,2,1,2,0,0,0,0

In NJ12 alone, the uninsured rate has gone from 11.1% to 8.6% since the ACA was implemented, and this 2.5 percentage point drop in the uninsured rate could be wiped out and reversed if the ACA is repealed.   So, I want to hear directly from my constituents about how the Affordable Care Act has helped you finally access the health care you need and deserve. Your stories will be critical as I fight on your behalf in Congress. Please take a moment and tell me how health care reform has impacted you and your family.

Last year, Americans from across the nation braved deadly winter conditions and violent suppression by law enforcement to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux community and draw attention to the serious health, safety, and cultural risks associated with this project. Risks that were being disregarded by regulators and last month, their concerns and protests were further validated. The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources attempt to minimize this by posting the information to the online database without notifying the public is troubling, shameful and does a huge disservice to the public.  As a member of Congress, I have long stood behind the Standing Rock Sioux and against the rubber stamping of energy projects that have clear and irreversible negative environmental consequences. The government at every level, has a duty to protect all Americans, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized. DAPL is just one example of harmful energy projects across the country -- including in my very own district -- that face tremendous and valid community opposition and yet, are still ushered through the approval process due to inadequate federal review. That is why just yesterday, I announced that I am reintroducing the SAFER Pipelines Act to begin to restore the public's expectations and confidence in a thorough review of these impactful energy decisions.","link","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/10/dakota-access-pipeline-first-oil-leak","theguardian.com",33,1,24,2,0,3,14,32

Because of the chronic pain and fatigue, she was unable to work full time. The ACA allowed her to stay on her parents' health insurance until she was 26 and enabled her to purchase a plan in the individual marketplace that she would not have been able to afford otherwise. With this coverage, Caitlin was able to start seeing a specialist who is working with her to figure out what unique treatment style(s) would work best for her body and she has since gotten enough relief from her symptoms to allow her to maintain a steady part-time job at a nonprofit she cares deeply about as well as freelance on the side. She hopes that better medications will be developed in the near future that will allow her to support herself, live independently, and have the life she‚Äôs always dreamed of.  Since the November election, Caitlin and countless others have lived in fear of losing the very health insurance that has helped them lead more fulfilled lives. Caitlin has had to face the reality that, without it, she could lose the ability to work altogether and would ultimately have no choice but to go back on opioids -- which make her sick and worsen the fatigue -- because she wouldn't be able to afford the medications approved for her condition. ‚ÄúI'm only 28 but my life would effectively be over without the ability to manage my condition,‚Äù she says.

This is a chronic illness, caused by an autoimmune response that is not yet fully understood. It is also irreversible and requires multiple doses of insulin every day to keep her alive. Thankfully, they started receiving coverage under the ACA two years ago which has given them the necessary coverage for her medical expenses. And while not inexpensive, they are very thankful to have a healthcare plan that they can manage and that keeps their child receiving what she needs. Without it, Amy‚Äôs family‚Äôs out-of-pocket costs would range from $5000-$6000 every month -- an amount that they, and many other Americans, would never be able to afford.

As a Vice Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee and a member of the House Oversight Committee, I have been closely working with my colleagues to draw attention to the rise of domestic terrorist threats posed by white nationalists and right wing extremists.

Instead of working with Democrats to reform our tax code, Republicans chose to rush through a partisan giveaway to the rich and powerful that adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit, triggers $25 billion in cuts to Medicare, and increases the number of uninsured by 13 million. Republicans have made clear they plan to use these deficits to create a manufactured crisis where they have an excuse to cut vital social programs that seniors and low-income Americans rely on in the coming weeks ‚Äì including Medicare.   Additionally, this bill is a brazen attack on New Jersey. By limiting the state and local tax deduction, it subjects New Jerseyans to double taxation, devastates property values, and puts state and local budgets at risk, and the communities I represent would be among the hardest hit in the entire nation. Despite Republicans‚Äô claims of trickle down benefits which have not worked since their introduction during the Reagan Administration, it is clear this legislation would be harmful to the vast majority of New Jersey residents.   Republicans are so shameless in this tax scam that their meager benefits for individuals are set to expire, while their most generous tax breaks for businesses are permanent, leaving my constituents and future generations holding the bag for years to come on this heartless scheme.   The American people have made clear they see this GOP tax scam for what it is: a massive tax cut for the President and his rich friends and donors.
