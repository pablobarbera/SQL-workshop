This is truly the key to our nation's future, and I will continue working with my colleagues and the White House to make these improvements a reality.  I was pleased to hear President Trump address many issues critical to everyday Americans, such as job creation, tax reform, national security, supporting our military and veterans, and improving addiction treatment services. We heard many ideas from the President tonight where I believe we can find common ground and produce real solutions for the American people, and I look forward to continuing my work with colleagues in Congress to do so.  The President made a strong call for the principles that will guide the replacement of Obamacare. I look forward to passing legislation that repeals Obamacare and builds a sustainable system for all American families.  The President is correct that we must tackle the violence that is harming many of our communities. I believe this means bringing our law enforcement and communities together to better understand and find solutions for the issues they both face. I will continue my work with Trey Gowdy and others in this vital area.  We saw the true power of the American spirit tonight with the recognition of Carryn Owens, the widow of US Navy SEAL Chief William Ryan Owens. It was one of the most powerful moments I have ever witnessed, and our never-ending gratitude remains with Ryan and all of those who have sacrificed for our nation. God Bless them, and God Bless the United States of America.","status",NA,NA,1643,135,79,222,0,2,0,5

That is why I am incredibly passionate about my Opportunity Agenda. It focuses on restoring hope in the lives of millions of Americans seeking a quality education, better opportunities, and those who simply wish to build a bridge to a brighter future for their families.   As part of my Opportunity Agenda, my CHOICE Act will help unlock the potential of students who might otherwise be left behind. Every single child in this country deserves access to a quality education, and the CHOICE Act was created to provide military families, parents of students with disabilities, and low-income families with more options so that their child can succeed.   My LEAP Act, also an important piece to my Opportunity Agenda, encourages folks to earn while they learn through apprenticeships.  In South Carolina, we have seen amazing results from apprenticeship programs, and the LEAP Act builds on the model we use in the state; it seeks to bring that success to the entire nation.   The final piece of my Opportunity Agenda is the bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act, which would incentivize investment in economically distressed communities in every state, without creating a new government program. There are more than 50 million Americans living in poverty, and the IIOA would reinvest private sector dollars back into communities that need it the most.   As someone who grew up living paycheck to paycheck, I am committed to finding solutions to lifting up millions of families across the nation by creating a system that leads to a quality education and good paying jobs. And I think my Opportunity Agenda would certainly help brighten the path forward.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTimScott/photos/a.282954245070048.74200.163207553711385/1437719579593503/?type=3",NA,232,28,18,20,0,0,0,0

My Investing in Opportunity Act hopes to revitalize these areas by enticing private investments through a deferred capital gains tax.

By creating a way for these funds to be invested in our most fragile communities, we will help generate job growth, prosperity, and opportunity to those who have lost hope.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTimScott/photos/a.282954245070048.74200.163207553711385/1440563502642444/?type=3",NA,314,47,31,19,0,0,0,3

Folks are given the opportunity to acquire new skills, and in the case of apprenticeships, they can also earn while they learn.

Education is truly the key to the American Dream, and I continue to believe that when parents have more choices, their children have a better chance at succeeding. My CHOICE was built on this notion.   Too many students are not getting access to the education they deserve. That is why it is critical for us to ensure that families in every community have a variety of educational options at their disposal so that their kids can unleash their full potential. My CHOICE Act seeks to let parents of children with special needs, military families, and low-income households in our nationâ€™s capital decide whatâ€™s best for their individual childâ€™s needs.

There has been quite a bit of misinformation spread about what this vote meant, and I hope I can ease your concerns.   First, and most importantly, my vote did not change a single thing regarding current privacy protections for your online data. The rule that was negated never even went into effect. Additionally, financial and health data are already protected regardless of where they exist by the Gramm Leach Biley Act and HIPAA, respectively.   The internet, from ISPs to companies like Google, has historically been regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). However, the Obama Administrationâ€™s Federal Communications Commission attempted to go around the law, established by Congress, by creating a new rule that would steal this regulatory ability for themselves. This would cause duplication, waste, and increased spending, with no evidence that the FTC was unable to continue doing the job they have done for the past decade. I simply voted to stop this rule from going into effect.   I take the privacy concerns of all Americans very seriously, and would not vote for legislation that I believe would allow for personal, private data to be released without permission. Thank you again for sharing your concerns.","status",NA,NA,852,174,300,45,2,0,3,40

Despite a standing agreement banning the use of chemical weapons, Assad has violated the guidelines time and time again. This was the last time it would go without consequences.

My bipartisan LEAP Act incentivizes companies to expand their apprenticeship programs using a South Carolina-style model to help folks earn while they learn.  I am excited to see the White House put workforce development and the skills gap at the forefront. Whether it be the SKILLS Act passed a couple of years ago, my bipartisan LEAP Act that I introduced in this Congress, or encouraging career and technical education, there are some concrete steps we can take to ensure the needs of employers better match the skills of our workforce. This is an exciting week, and I look forward to working with the White House and my colleagues in Congress to make these solutions a reality.  Many employers explain the reason for their unfilled jobs as a lack of available trained workers. Apprenticeships are a proven way to help people develop in-demand skills and to meet the needs of employers, yet they compose just 0.2 percent of the nationâ€™s workforce. By 2020, the United States is expected to experience a shortage of 3 million workers with associate degrees or higher and 5 million workers with technical certificates and credentials.  In 2016 in the U.S. there were approximately 505,000 active apprentices in registered apprenticeship programs. By contrast, in Germany nearly 50 percent of all young people go through apprenticeship programs.  Studies show that apprenticeships are a wise investment for both participants and the U.S. government: individuals who complete registered apprenticeship programs earn over $240,000 more over their careers than people who did not participate in such programs, and the tax return on every Federal Government dollar invested in registered apprenticeship programs is $27.","status",NA,NA,258,25,17,12,0,0,0,6

Todayâ€™s announcement is a clear example of how we can help folks gain access to health insurance by increasing affordable options and empowering small businesses to help their employees gain access to coverage. The facts donâ€™t lie. By 2018, nearly fifty percent of all U.S. counties are expected to have only one option on the exchange, leaving more than a quarter of a million people with no option for coverage. Not to mention premiums continue to rise with South Carolinians facing a 31% increase by next year. Todayâ€™s decision shows what we can do to help the American people as we continue the healthcare debate surrounding the repeal and replace of Obamacare.","status",NA,NA,1847,690,209,172,10,9,27,403
