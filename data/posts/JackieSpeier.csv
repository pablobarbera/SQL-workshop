We also fought their attempts to ban photos and videos on the House floor, but the item was passed by the Republican majority and seeks to silence House Members by fining them $2,500 for their second so-called offenses.        These efforts to undermine the People’s House thankfully were subject to the harsh glare of the media spotlight, but many other issues that deserve similar attention were lost amidst the clamor. I proposed three changes to the House Rules, all with bipartisan support, that would have greatly improved the function and transparency of Congress. My amendments would have made the House’s optional sexual harassment training mandatory; required witnesses testifying before Congress to disclose their ties to foreign governments; and prohibited the more than 100 Members who currently sleep in their taxpayer-funded offices from continuing to do so.        Unfortunately these commonsense measures were not included in the House Rules for the 115th Congress. I fear that under President-elect Trump, this is just the beginning of Republicans running rampant over core democratic principles. But know that despite the current political climate, I will do everything in my power to fight for accountability, transparency, and truth.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10154697099236977/?type=3",NA,1048,160,161,81,0,5,52,33

He referenced the so-called Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case. Ms. Yates promised she would, saying, “Senator, I believe that the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has the obligation to follow the law and the Constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president.” Yesterday she delivered on her promise.

Our “Move along, nothing to see here” Attorney General wants reporters and meddling congressional investigators to stop asking about his ties to Russia. He lied while under oath during his January Senate confirmation hearing after Senator Al Franken plainly asked, “If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?”   Sessions answered, ""Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.""  Now it turns out that Attorney General Sessions met twice during the campaign with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This information has prompted Republican Leadership in Congress to call for Sessions to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the November election. And Sessions told America in a press conference held yesterday afternoon that he and his staff agreed with that assessment.  But in many ways Jefferson Beauregard Sessions has just begun to fight. His defense is shifting day by day. He no longer claims to have NEVER spoken to Russian authorities during the campaign. On Wednesday, he gave a nuanced answer filled with righteous indignation, saying, ""I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.""  He then claimed that the meetings could have been related to his role on the Senate Armed Services Committee – however, given Kislyak met with no other Senator on the Committee, including Chairman McCain, that explanation holds no water, or vodka.  During his press conference the next day, Sessions shifted into grayer territory, saying his response to Sen. Franken’s question during his confirmation hearing was “honest and correct as I understood it at the time.”  Had Mr. Sessions given his Wednesday answer in January, something along the lines of “I spoke with the ambassador, but not about the campaign,” this likely wouldn’t be an issue. But by lying about having ANY contact with Russian government officials it becomes pretty obvious that Sessions, like Trump’s first National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, has something to hide.   That is why this Fox in the Hen House must not only recuse himself from this investigation, he must resign his post as Attorney General. After all, honesty and forthrightness are necessary qualities for America’s Top Cop.    #FoxInTheHenHouseFriday #Sessions #Russia #Trump","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10154892841491977/?type=3",NA,113,23,21,7,3,1,0,14

I am deeply troubled to learn that nothing has changed. The fact that the reporter and Marine veteran Thomas Brennan who has brought this story to light has received death threats and the fact that his wife has received rape threats underscores the vileness of the perpetrators.

After a horrible morning last Tuesday, in which the President suggested that recent attacks on Jewish Community Centers and cemeteries might be false flags and that the U.S. military was at fault for the death of Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens, he seemed to gain some semblance of control just in time for his first Joint Session of Congress. He was coherent, he didn’t rant, and he didn’t attack the press. If you hadn’t tuned into the new since the election, you  might think President Trump wasn’t too much different than his predecessors.  Wednesday morning we woke to a contented President Trump. His only tweet said simply, “THANK YOU.” But then we received news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who emphatically claimed under oath that he “had no communications with Russians,” during the time of the presidential campaign had, in fact, met twice with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kisliyak.  The news prompted top Republicans in Congress on Thursday to demand that Sessions recuse himself from any investigation involving Trump and Russia, and I and my Democratic colleagues called for his resignation. The president, however, told reporters there was “no reason” for Sessions to remove himself from the investigation.  Then he took to Twitter to attack Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer with a decade-old photo of him eating Krispy Kreme donuts with Vladimir Putin at a gas station opening in Manhattan. Evidently, the President equates eating donuts in front of the press with charges that members of his Cabinet lied to Congress and/or had potentially untoward relations with Russian oligarchs.   By Friday morning, the calm, assured President we had seen Tuesday night was already starting to give way to the Mr. Hyde within. He reportedly awoke angry that his staff had not contained the Russia story and held a contentious meeting in the Oval Office with his senior staff. He then boarded Air Force One for another trip to his resort in Florida, where he’s already spent 14 days – two weeks of his six weeks in office – at an estimated cost of $12 million in taxpayer money.   Late Friday, the Washington Post wrote that the Trump Administration’s plan to slash the budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) by hundreds of millions of dollars would hinder accurate weather forecasting and warnings, putting American lives at risk. Does the Administration not want Americans to know when a hurricane is bearing down on them?   By dawn’s early light Saturday morning, the President was back to his old ways, seeking to distract the American public from the real news by claiming as fact a made-up story – perpetuated by far right radio host Mark Levin and tabloid website Breitbart – that a “silent coup” was being carried out against President Trump by President Barack Obama. They claimed, without a shred of evidence whatsoever, that President Obama tapped the phones in Trump Tower prior to the November election. At 6:35 a.m. ET the President tweeted, “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” It went downhill from there.  And lest we forget another of the President’s priorities, he tweeted about an hour later, “Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show.”  Sunday found Trump’s various representatives on the morning news shows defending his lie. White House press secretary Sean Spicer released a statement demanding a congressional investigation and stating, “Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.” Apparently Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not get the memo as she went on to discuss the matter at length on ABC’s “This Week” program. And FBI Director James Comey also responded Sunday by asking the Justice Department to refute Trump’s  false claim, because if President Obama had sought to tap then-candidate Trump’s phone (or anyone’s phone for that matter) Comey himself would have had to sign off on the move. And both Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have made it clear that no wiretap was requested or ordered. The unprecedented attack on a previous President is truly beyond the pale.  It also wasn’t the best set up for Monday morning’s introduction of the President’s newly “revised” travel ban, which he and his Administration proudly claimed is the same ban against Muslims and refugees, with the same purpose. It’s also so narrowly tailored to avoid legal conflict that it’s been deemed pointless by critics and a repetition of existing constraints on refugees.   Also on Monday, House Republicans revealed their bill to “repeal and replace” Obamacare, earning a tweet from the President that declared, “Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out of review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster – is imploding fast!” Too bad what the plan actually does is eliminate the ACA’s income-based subsidies, putting lower income and middle class families at serious risk and charging seniors more for their care. The Republicans also conveniently “forgot"" to include the cost of the plan and how many Americans would lose insurance if Congress passes the plan.   #TuesdayTrumpDump","status",NA,NA,168,37,52,2,0,20,12,60

Meanwhile, House Republicans are furtively passing extraordinarily harmful bills. So each week, I will highlight the legislation that is coming to the floor and the real-life consequences that it will have on Americans. From big-business giveaways to letting corporate polluters off the hook, this resource, which I'm calling ""Through the Legislative Looking Glass,"" will keep you up to date about the Republicans’ crusade to make America dangerous and dirty again. I’ll also post each week’s “Through the Legislative Looking Glass” summary on my website so that all of the dangerous bills the House quietly passes each week can be easily accessed by the public.  This week in Through the Looking Glass, nothing is what is seems. The Republican-led House of Representatives is voting on the “Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act,” which is anything but fair. It guts class action suits and strips Americans of the ability to join together to bring consumer, worker, or civil rights class actions against corporations. By making it practically impossible for people to pursue federal class action suits, this bill creates barriers to an already rigorous process. Without class action law suits, we would not have racial equality in schools from Brown v. Board of Education, protection from sexual harassment in the workplace from Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., or protection from wastewater from Anderson v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co, the case that inspired the movie Erin Brockovich. Class actions are a critical tool to help workers, consumers, and victims who have been wronged. This bill eliminates this tool and dismantles the basic rights of Americans to pursue justice in the courts.  If this weren’t bad enough, the bill also attacks victims of asbestos. It lets companies shirk their responsibilities to victims of asbestos exposure by adding extra obstacles to victims who are already struggling to receive their just compensation. Adding insult to injury, this bill violates victims’ privacy by requiring the entities responsible for paying asbestos victims to release their sensitive personal information, including their names and medical histories. This bill does nothing to help victims of asbestos exposure suffering from serious health problems – instead, it re-victimizes them and invades their privacy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10154913924871977/?type=3",NA,203,46,124,3,0,6,3,55

This week’s feature is dedicated to the many foxes that are the driving force behind Trumpcare, the Republicans’ reckless quest to destroy the ACA and replace it with a tax break for millionaires and billionaires.  The bottom line is that Trumpcare is going to make you pay more for less. Trumpcare benefits individuals who are healthy, younger, and richer, and it hurts those who are older, in need of health care, and fighting to get by on fixed or limited incomes.  The Brookings Institute estimates that Trumpcare will increase the number of uninsured Americans by more than 15 million. AARP estimates that under Trumpcare, a 64-year-old making $15,000 a year would see an $8,400 hike in premiums plus copays. Yes, you read that right – Republicans want to charge seniors over half their total income for health care.  If you experience a gap in coverage - for example if you lose your job or change jobs – insurance companies will be allowed to charge you a 30 percent higher premium.Trumpcare also defunds Planned Parenthood, leaving 2.5 million Americans without their preferred provider.  This is a far cry from the “insurance for everybody” promise President Trump made during his telephone interview with The Washington Post just last month. And Speaker Ryan’s glowing references to Trumpcare as beneficial to women in his Wednesday PowerPoint presentation would be laughable if it weren’t for the fact that it does the exact opposite, gutting coverage and sending us back to the days when being a woman qualifies as a preexisting health condition.  But the President and Speaker Ryan aren’t the only sly foxes storming the health care hen house. During the House Energy and Commerce markup of the bill, Republican Congressman John Shimkus of Illinois asked why men should have to pay for prenatal care. Could Congressman Shimkus be unaware of the role that men play in making babies? Also, House Oversight & Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah so helpfully noted that people have the choice to “invest” in their health care, saying, “Americans have choices and they’ve gotta make a choice. And so maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care. They’ve gotta make those decisions themselves.” Reality check: The cost of a new iPhone, with no contract, is $670, while the median health care cost per capita is $10,345. So unless people are buying 15 iPhones each year, that is not going to help them save for their appendix removals or cholesterol medication.  It’s time to hold on to our chickens, because pretty soon the hen house will only have foxes.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10154918875976977/?type=3",NA,98,18,43,5,0,7,6,30

Last week, the President started off  his Tuesday by firing off angry tweets bashing President Obama for releasing 122 detainees from Guantanamo Bay, who later rejoined the battlefield in their host countries. The problem is 113 of those 122 detainees were released by President George W. Bush.   Also on Tuesday, WikiLeaks, released troves of documents that it said were from the CIA. You might remember, in October, when presidential candidate Trump said, “I love WikiLeaks. Don’t you love WikiLeaks?”   Well, on Wednesday, Spokesman Sean Spicer informed reporters that the President was no longer a fan of the group.   Thursday found the President tweeting, “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”  Dozens of Republicans in the House and Senate, Democrats,  the American Medical Association, AARP, and advocacy groups across the political spectrum disagree.   On Friday, news broke that  Cork Wine Bar filed a lawsuit against the President, claiming he is engaged in unfair competition by using his position as President to promote his hotel’s restaurant and catering businesses. While, on the surface, this might seem petty, President Trump’s blatant refusal to stop taking money from foreign governments through his hotels and resorts is not at all petty. It’s troubling. As is his willingness to spend $3 million of tax payer funds every time he jets down to Mar-a-Lago  Also on Friday, the President, who called jobs reports during the Obama Administration “fake” and “phony,”  crowed about the good report released on his 50th day on the job.  And on this day, we also learned that not only was former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn a paid agent of Turkey, the President’s transition team knew about it and allowed him access to top secret government information. Before Friday was done, 46 US Attorneys across the country were told to submit their resignations. This, by itself, is not unusual in a new administration. They received their notice on the day they were supposed to pack up, and most learned via the media with no replacements waiting to take their places. Preet Bharara, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York who has charged many Wall Street companies with insider training and was investigating whether the President has received payments or other benefits from foreign governments through his businesses, was fired after he refused to resign.  On Saturday, President Trump met with advisors, not at the White House where taxpayers are already footing the bill, but at Trump National Golf Course in Virginia.  Sunday’s news shows were heavily focused on “Trumpcare,” the new Republican health care bill introduced last week that is opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP, and House and Senate Republicans as well as Democrats.   Monday was the deadline Congress gave the Trump Administration to find and release evidence for his ludicrous claims that President Obama committed a crime and wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 election. No evidence was provided. Instead, the Department of Justice asked for more time for its search. And White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the media was again at fault for taking the President at his word. He explained that by tweeting “Obama,” President Trump actually meant the Obama Administration. By putting his wiretapping reference in quotes, the President meant any kind of surveillance. And Spicer said that the President’s references to  “me” and “my” actually meant anyone involved in his campaign. Good to know.","status",NA,NA,104,32,35,0,1,11,2,29

Amid the explosive unveiling of the CBO report detailing the disastrous consequences of the Republican destruction of the ACA – and the leaking of an even more dire report by the White House regarding the harm that TrumpCare will wreak on hard-working Americans, seniors, and children – President Trump signed the Presidential Executive Order on a Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch. This order clears the way for the President's Cabinet to privatize, dismantle, and lay off vast swaths of the federal employees, affecting health and safety programs. This has been the dream of White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and many members of the President’s cabinet since Day One. The EPA, the Department of Education, the State Department, the Department of Energy, and many more federal agencies and offices have been identified as key targets by the Trump Administration and by the President himself.   The President cannot simply wipe out these departments without the consent of Congress. However, he can cut the budgets and staff of these departments rendering them impotent. That means undermining efforts to ensure we have safe, clean drinking water, clean sources of renewable energy, and Title IX protections so that students can receive an education free from discrimination and harassment.   The President and the Republican Party must understand that the strength of the United States is not based solely on how many billions of dollars we throw at the military; remember we spend more than China and Russia combined. Our strength also depends on a healthy environment, good-paying middle-class jobs, a strong educational system, and of course, access to health care. I will do everything I can to fight the dismantling of years of progress in civil rights, environmental standards, and women's rights. And I will not forget to keep insisting that Congress investigate the links between the President and his Cabinet and Russian oligarchs, another point that has been lost in the health care shuffle this week. But this fight will be fierce and will be largely determined by the response of the American people.

The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives is pushing through the “Veterans 2nd Amendment Act,” (H.R. 1181) which in reality puts veterans having mental health crises at grave risk of suicide by firearm.    H.R. 1181 would enable Veterans Affairs beneficiaries who suffer from severe mental illness to buy firearms. The so-called “Veterans 2nd Amendment Act” ends the current process of having the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs submit certain mental health records to the national background check system. However, veterans on this list have the same Second Amendment rights as everyone else – there is already a due process system in place that provides them with the opportunity to appeal decisions that deny them of their right to a firearm.    Selling guns to veterans undergoing mental health crises with no questions asked is dangerous and shortsighted. Suicide among veterans has risen sharply, and suicide among female veterans has increased by 85% since 2001. More than 20 U.S. veterans kill themselves each day, and more than two in three of those suicides are carried out with firearms.    Instead of passing a bill that puts our veterans at greater risk of death by suicide, I urge my colleagues to pass the “Fix Gun Checks Act,” which I introduced last Congress. This bill makes Americans safer by requiring a background check for every gun sale, including at trade shows and online, which would save countless lives.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10154935637446977/?type=3",NA,42,6,16,1,0,0,14,9

Also shot was a 9-year-old student, who has survived, before the gunman killed himself. As I’ve said many times, the epidemic of gun violence impacting our communities in cases such as this one in San Bernardino demands that Congress do more than send thoughts and prayers and hold moments of silence.    According to police, the perpetrator Cedric Anderson had a criminal history including weapons charges, drug charges, and assault and battery.  While we are still awaiting confirmation of how Anderson obtained the .357 Magnum he used in the mass shooting, this tragedy once again underscores the need for Congress to pass common sense gun reform that protects citizens, responsible gun owners, and the Constitution. We must require universal background checks and prohibit individuals with a history of criminal charges or serious mental health issues from purchasing guns. If we once again refuse to act, we continue to condemn thousands of innocent people to death and heartbreak.    Schoolchildren sitting in their classrooms should be safe from gun violence.

Last week, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad dropped deadly Sarin gas on civilians in the town of Khan Shaykhun. The world reacted in horror as images of lifeless children, frantic parents, and unimaginable suffering were broadcast across the globe. Many wondered how President Trump would respond. Only days before, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley made statements that the United States had little interest in removing Assad from power. Rather than acknowledge any connection between this sudden change in U.S. policy and Assad’s sudden decision to act with impunity, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer instead placed the blame on President Obama for not enforcing his red line after a gas attack in 2013 – even though Donald Trump himself urged President Obama not to do so at that time.  We also learned last Tuesday that White House Political Director Steve Bannon no longer has a place in the National Security Council, where he never should have been in the first place. And Ivanka Trump told CBS This Morning host Gayle King, “I manage any conflict” that arises between the Trump Administration and Trump International Hotel. This, in itself, is a clear conflict, because she is now a White House employee and should be divested of any interest in Trump businesses.   On Wednesday, we awoke to an article in the New York Times that quoted the President as saying, “I think it's going to be the biggest story. It's such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time.” He wasn’t talking about possible collusion between his campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 Presidential election; but rather, accusing former National Security Adviser Susan Rice of committing a crime (based on no evidence) for seeking the names of Trump campaign officials referenced by Russian officials in their communications. Former NSA Rice said the accusation was “absolutely false,” and former officials from Democratic and Republican Administrations said her actions were routine, appropriate, and legal.   On Thursday, the President flew to his Florida golf resort to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also finally commented on the Syrian gas attack, calling it “horrific” and blaming President Obama. Later, during a dinner with the Chinese President, the President ordered a missile strike on the Syrian airbase where the attacks were launched. Eric Trump later said that his father’s decision to employ military force was based not on any sound military or diplomatic strategy, but was instead influenced by Ivanka’s emotional reaction to the images on television.  On Friday, the President was oddly quiet about the release of the Department of Labor’s March jobs report, even though just two days earlier he had tweeted out a Fox News story claiming 170,000 new jobs were estimated for the March report, and claimed he actually created  263,000 jobs. The DoL report revealed only 98,000 jobs were added in March, fewer than half the number of jobs added in either January or February and more than 100,000 jobs fewer than the President had claimed earlier in the week.   Saturday evening, President Trump had what was called “a friendly chat” with brothers and Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch at his Mar-a-Lago Resort. The Koch brothers guests of club member Chris Ruddy, owner of Newsmax, a far right media company that, among other things, perpetuated the rumor that First Lady Hillary Clinton murdered White House counsel Vince Foster and, in 2009, advocated for a military coup to “handle the Obama problem.”  Sunday, as the president played his second round of golf over the weekend, he tweeted, “So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U.S. strongly condemns. I have great…,” followed by, “… confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly.” The President’s concern is valid. It would be good to see that concern extended to numerous bombings in the region that have killed far more non-Christians.   Monday saw a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) against the Department of Homeland Security because the Secret Service has failed to provide visitor logs from the White House, Mar-a-Lago, and Trump Tower despite the Obama Administration regularly releasing such information.  It was the same day that the President failed to participate in the tradition of Passover in the White House, set by President Obama.   And that was followed yesterday by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s dumbfounding statement that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was worse than Adolf Hitler in at least one respect. Spicer said, “Hitler didn’t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons.” He managed to make things worse when he tried to clarify his stupefying claim by adding, “I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no … he was not using the gas on his own people in the same way that Assad is doing. There was not … he brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that. But what I’m saying is the way that Assad used them, where he went into towns, dropped them, the use of it — I appreciate the clarification, [denying that Hitler used gas] was not the intent.”","status",NA,NA,83,38,29,0,0,3,11,25

Whether you are a scientist marching today, a student cleaning up a beach or a concerned citizen planting a tree, we can all do our part to make a contribution. I would like to share with you the thoughts of the Republican Co-Chair of the first Earth Day in 1970, Pete McCloskey, a man I deeply respect and admire. He, along with Wisconsin Senator Gaylor Nelson and Dennis Hayes organized a the very first national day of environmental study that brought thousands of student and teachers to the streets and eventually gave birth to the environmental movement. The results affected every American. As Pete says in his essay, a Democratic Congress and a Republican President, Richard Nixon, passed landmark legislation on a bi-partisan basis. The Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, protection of Marine mammals, coastal zones, and The Endangered Species Act were enacted into law, with Nixon creating the Environmental Protection Agency. It is up to all of us to reignite this movement.                                         Earth Day, April 22, 1970              A Tribute to Senator Gaylord Nelson (D. Wisconsin) and                     Stanford Student Body President Denis Hayes       On entering Nebraska on the old Oregon Trail, one is greeted by a sign:   ""Welcome to Nebraska.  Home of Arbor Day.""   Arbor Day had been conceived by a Nebraska school teacher in 1874, with the idea that each school child should plant a seedling for Nebraska's rolling grasslands on April 22nd each year.  In time Arbor Day came to be celebrated in every U.S. state and in many countries around the world.   On some future day, a visitor to California on the road to Donner Pass or the Mojave Desert, may someday find a sign:  ""Welcome to California.  Home of Earth Day.""   The first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, was motivated by the love for California of Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who in his youth had attended San Jose State College and become familiar with Yosemite, Sequoia, Lassen and our National Parks and Monuments. He had backpacked on the John Muir Trail in the High Sierra and had come to love the mountainous wilderness, the redwood forests, deserts and sunny beaches of the Golden State.   Musing with a friend in San Francisco, one late afternoon watching a sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge, and thinking of the beauties of California, he said  You know, we ought to celebrate a day to honor the Earth.""   The friend said, ""Yes, and it ought to be bi-partisan.""  Nelson replied:  ""And it ought to be bicameral.""   Nelson recruited the Stanford Student Body President, 21 year-old Denis Hayes to direct the effort, and asked the only reputed Republican environmentalist in the House to be his Co-Chair.  The head of the Conservation Foundation, Sid Howe, raised $100,000, and commencing in January, 1970, Hayes assembled a group of young people, average age 20 or less, to join him in Washington D.C., there to prepare for a national ""day of environmental study.""   Earth Day, April 22nd, a Sunday, was to be a day of contemplation of the need for clearer air, purer water, protection of our landscapes and wildlife, and the health of the oceans.   It was during the heat of student protest against the Viet Nam War, and the tragedy of Kent State would occur two weeks later, yet all across the nation, that afternoon of Sunday, April 22nd, students and teachers turned their attention to a national discussion of environmental issues.    But the young organizers of Earth Day were not through.   Recognizing the need to take their concerns to the level of actual policy, they held a single press conference, naming 12 Members of the House ""The Dirty Dozen,"" and vowing their defeat at the polls. Few took them seriously.   But organize they did.  In the following primary elections, thousands of students assembled in Baltimore and Denver to turn out the vote in their targeted races;  The following day, the nation awoke to the astonishing news that the two Democrats on the list had both been defeated, by those thousands of students turning out unprecedented vote totals in what had been considered no-contest primaries.  The environmental movement was born.   This was followed by similar turnouts and similar results in the November elections for five of the ten Republicans of the Dirty Dozen.   The result was startling.  When Congress convened in January, 1971, with seven new Democrats, a new ""pro-environment"" majority in both parties in both the House and Senate had emerged.   And what happened?  Over the next four years, with a Democratic Congress and a Republican President, Richard Nixon, landmark legislation were passed on a bi-partisan basis.   The Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, protection of Marine mammals, coastal zones, and The Endangered Species Act were enacted into law, with Nixon creating the Environmental Protection Agency.   Bi-partisan environmental cooperation lasted for 24 years, with four Republican and two Democratic Presidents.   Regrettably, those years of bi-partisan cooperation ended with the ascension of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House, in 1995. For the past 21 years, the Republican Party has abandoned the original principles of Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot and environmental pioneers, and become a party opposed not only to environmental protections but dedicated to the removal of most of the environmental regulations of past Republican presidents. Ford, Reagan and George H.W. Bush.   Worse, today's Republicans have abandoned the ethic of preservation of wild places for the benefit of the public, instead pursuing the actual evisceration of regulatory protections of habitat and species, and further, the giving away, transfer, or sale of federal public lands.   With control of  both Houses of Congress and the White House firmly in the hands of Republicans, the next chance at achieving even a remote check on the intended destruction of the environment and the abandonment of the concept of delaying global warming by the Trump Administration and his Republican devotees in the Congress will be the 2018 elections.   And what better place for such defeats to occur than in California, the Golden State, where, led by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Fresno,   Republican Members like Northern Californians McClintock, LaMalfa, Denham, Valadeo, and Nunes are already acting to end protection for rivers and wildlife habitat, together with an end to scientific research into global warming. They have already voted to permit the shooting of hibernating bears and their cubs from aircraft and the gassing of wolf pups in their dens in Alaskan wildlife refuges, and propose to cut the funding for the EPA, the Fish & Wildlife Service, and other science and environment-based agencies. They have devised and plan to pass legislation to deed federal lands over to states and private developers.    The Endangered Species Act is a primary target.   By this time next year, its protections and those of the EPA may be largely illusory.   Hopefully, a new generation of passionate students will rise up now and in 2018, perhaps naming and defeating a ""Dirty Thirty,"" or even ""Dirty Fifty"" Members of the House, turning out to vote in record numbers,  and forcing Congress to re-establish balanced environmental protections and a return of efforts to slow, if not reverse, global warming. This would be a fitting tribute to Senator Nelson, Denis Hayes and the first Earth Day forty seven years ago.   Pete McCloskey Republican Co-Chair Earth Day, 1970","status",NA,NA,132,2,22,4,0,0,0,0

For a week, the children collected all the food that wasn't eaten at lunch time, and they compared that to the amount of food needed by a hungry child. In another exercise, students were given tickets and were then offered the portion of a meal represented by the ticket. So, one student might receive 40% of a meal while another child might receive 2% of the same meal. This taught the students about the amount of food that we consume in the U.S. when compared with other nations.   In addition, parishioners heard homilies, read bulletin articles, and attended soup suppers during Lent to learn more about the problem.

This bill claims to give workers flexibility with their schedules, but what it really does is give employers a new excuse to avoid paying overtime. House Republicans state that this bill will allow employees to trade their overtime compensation for extra time off. In reality, it includes so many loopholes that employees might be robbed of their time-and-a-half overtime pay without the guarantee that they would ever be able to take comp time.  While Republicans shamefully passed this smoke-and-mirrors bill this afternoon, Democrats have provided real solutions. The “Healthy Families Act” (H.R. 1516) would provide workers with paid sick time off – 36% of the workforce, or 41 million U.S. workers, do not have paid sick leave.

Let’s make sure every gun purchase requires a background check, rather than just 60 percent of them. Why have we created a separate gun market for criminals, domestic abusers and the mentally ill? Let’s close the loophole that allows 91 percent of known or suspected terrorists who walk into a gun store to walk out with a deadly weapon. Let’s ban assault weapons. The American people are too familiar with the AR-15 and similar firearms. These are weapons designed to hunt humans in their most vulnerable places: the classroom, the movie theater, the nightclub. Finally, let’s lift the ban on gun violence research so we can use science to finds ways to address this public health epidemic.   Would these policies stop all gun violence? Absolutely not.

The 2008 financial meltdown is seared in my memory. In the worst crisis since the Great Depression, millions of Americans, and thousands of my constituents, lost their jobs, their homes, and their retirement savings. My colleagues in Congress and I took on the banks to make sure that this never happened again. We passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, which created the strongest consumer protections in history. This placed commonsense regulations on our financial institutions to prevent them from taking advantage of consumers.   Evidently the Republicans in Congress don’t remember the financial meltdown, because now they are pushing a bill that should be called the WRONG CHOICE Act. This bill is a dream come true for Wall Street. It deregulates the financial industry to levels before Dodd-Frank, and would completely gut the Consumer Bureau, leaving consumers defenseless against abuses by financial institutions. If Republicans really want to protect the “forgotten men and women of our country,” they should focus less on Goldman Sachs executives and more on the families who lost their homes and retirement accounts ten years ago. We must not let the President’s unhinged tweets distract us from the Republicans’ quiet war on the financial security of everyday Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10155234735846977/?type=3",NA,94,16,37,1,0,0,18,40

Mr. Comey told it like it is, under oath: the President lied. He lied about why Comey was fired, he lied about the state of the FBI, he lied about who initiated their one-on-one dinner and why, and he lied about not asking Mr. Comey to lay off Michael Flynn. Mr. Comey’s testimony makes clear that the President sought to shield General Flynn, but was willing to throw everyone else under the bus. Why the loyalty to Flynn – is the President scared by the story Flynn said he has to tell when he sought immunity?  But what I find most alarming is that at no time did President Trump convey to Mr. Comey any degree of concern about the national security implications of Russian intervention into our democratic processes. Instead, the President remained solely focused on the welfare of General Flynn and himself, not the security of the American people. Throughout the campaign, and now as President, Mr. Trump has consistently chosen to take a pass on holding Russia accountable for its actions, instead choosing to ignore Russian provocation – going as far as to praise Vladimir Putin. The President has been silent as Russian jets buzz our ships in international waters and as Russian nuclear bombers loop off our west coast. He's been silent as Putin lied about Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria. He struck a line acknowledging our NATO treaty commitments, which weakens the alliance to Russia's benefit. As if that isn’t enough, he's planning to give back the seized properties within the U.S. that the Russians used to spy on us. All this goes entirely against the advice of his respected national security team. We must turn over every rock until all the potential misdeeds are exposed and the President is held to account.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10155243132061977/?type=3",NA,220,36,34,5,1,11,1,26

I struggled with the incapacitating pain and fear caused by PTSD after I was shot five times in Jonestown, Guyana 38 years ago. My experience lasted mere nanoseconds and was nothing compared to the violence and brutality our brave military service members endure every day, the abuse suffered by children and sexual assault survivors, and the trauma suffered by mass shooting victims. The extensive therapy I received immediately after my ordeal was critical to the success of my recovery, which is why I am fighting for nothing less for all Americans. #PTSDAwarenessDay https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/how-common-is-ptsd.asp","link","https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/how-common-is-ptsd.asp","ptsd.va.gov",121,19,38,19,0,2,21,6

The surgery and four day hospital stay alone cost more than $100,000. She told me, ""Had it not been for the Affordable Care Act, I would be buried in medical debt, unable to easily pursue the career I had worked so hard for."" Fortunately, Alyssa was covered by her parents' health care plan because of the ACA, and she was able to receive the care she needed and made a full recovery. As she told me, her concerns are two-fold as she now works as a occupational therapist and sees patients who struggle to pay for medications and who will be in serious jeopardy if the Senate Trumpcare bill is forced through.

Medicare and Medicaid programs are lifelines for so many of my constituents, including Sascha from San Franscisco. Sascha is a quadriplegic with a speech disability as a result of cerebral palsy. She recently told me that when she was 3-years-old, a doctor told her young, single mother that Sascha would “never be able to do much of anything. [But] with a great deal of help from my mom and all the other people she calls my village, I was able to prove that doctor wrong. The support of Medicaid has been critical to my success.” Sascha relies on Medicaid for at-home and community-based care, including having an attendant to help her bathe, dress, go to work, and run errands. Her attendants have been a literal lifeline to the outside world and have enabled her to lead a full and productive life in her community, rather than languishing in an institution or nursing home.  Thanks to Medicaid, Sasha was able to attend UC Berkeley and she has since worked for many years providing disability awareness and resource programs to thousands of students in the Bay Area. Medicaid also saved her life, and her financial security, after she was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2013. Due to her disability, she suffered severe complications that resulted in a five month hospital stay. As Sascha said, “If there had been a cap on Medicaid, my family would have gone bankrupt … I could have just died. A Medicaid cap is a real ‘death panel.’”  Medicaid has also been critical to ensuring my constituent Marissa’s health. Marissa is a transgender woman living in South San Francisco, who for a year now has received her Hormone Replacement Therapy and vital medications through Medi-Cal.  Marissa told me, “I am absolutely shocked by the GOP and Trump's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and concerned for the well-being of myself and many others. Without access to affordable health care, I cannot continue treatment, and may have to detransition, which will destroy my physical and mental health. I urge you by any means necessary to keep the ACA in place, not just for me, but for the millions of Americans whose lives and livelihoods depend on it.” The only way forward for Sascha, Marissa, and all of America is for both parties to come together to fix the ACA and make it better for everyone.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10155457119291977/?type=3",NA,258,34,38,32,2,0,0,0

We will not stand by and let you deport babies, teens and college students.  I ask a simple question:  When does our inhumanity to our fellow man end?    I will do everything in my power to protect our DACA students by supporting legislation and speaking up proudly on their behalf.  Most importantly, Mr. President, and now more than ever, we need a pathway to citizenship for this nation’s undocumented immigrants whose only offense has been to live peacefully and productively as our neighbors without obtaining formal permission.

This is wasteful and dangerous. In 2013, of the 6,498 homicides committed by a firearm for which the type of weapon was known, 89% involved handguns.

To make matters worse, we now have scam artists who are trying to take advantage of this deadly tragedy and rip off fire victims. Please beware of scams and report anything that seems suspicious to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Here are some tips on how to avoid fraudulent phone calls and report them to FEMA:  State and federal recovery officials urge California residents to watch for and report any suspicious activity or potential fraud from scam artists, identity thieves and other criminals who may try to prey on vulnerable survivors of the October wildfires.  Common post-disaster fraud practices include:  •         Fake offers of state or federal aid: o   Beware if anyone claiming to be from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the state visits, calls or emails asking for an applicant’s Social Security number, bank account number or other sensitive information. o   Avoid scam artists who promise a disaster grant and ask for cash deposits or advance payments in full. o   Know that federal workers do not solicit or accept money. FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) staff never charge applicants for disaster assistance, inspections or help in filling out applications. Do not give out information and report people claiming to be government workers to local police. o   Provide your Social Security number and banking information only when registering for FEMA assistance, either by calling 800-621-3362, TTY 800-462-7585, or going online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or the smart phone FEMA App. If you use 711-Relay or Video Relay Services, call 800-621-3362. Operators are multilingual and calls are answered from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.   •         Phony housing inspectors: Owners/applicants may be especially vulnerable to phony housing inspectors claiming to represent FEMA or SBA. An applicant should always: o   Ask to see the inspector’s identification badge. All federal employees and contractors carry official, laminated photo identification. o   Inspectors also have each applicant’s nine-digit registration number. o   FEMA inspectors never require banking information.  It is important to note that FEMA housing inspectors verify damage, but do not hire or endorse specific contractors to fix homes or recommend repairs.  They do not determine your eligibility for assistance.   •         Fraudulent building contractors: When hiring a contractor, be sure to: o   Use licensed local contractors backed by reliable references.  o   Demand that contractors carry general liability insurance and worker’s compensation.  •         Bogus pleas for post-disaster donations: Unscrupulous solicitors may play on the sympathy for disaster survivors. Disaster aid solicitations may arrive by phone, email, letter or face-to-face visits. Verify legitimate solicitation: o   Ask for the charity’s exact name, street address, phone number, and Web address, then call the charity directly and confirm that the person asking for funds is an employee or volunteer. o   Don’t pay with cash. o   Request a receipt with the charity’s name, street address, phone number and Web address (if applicable).  Anyone with knowledge of fraud, waste or abuse may call the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or report it to the Federal Trade Commission at www.ftccompliantassistant.gov You may also send an email to DHSOIGHotline@dhs.gov","link","http://www.disasterassistance.gov/","disasterassistance.gov",56,9,34,1,0,0,19,1

If you like your current plan, your personal information has not changed (i.e. income stayed constant, no marriages, no childbirths, etc.), and if you allowed Covered CA to automatically check your income during last year’s enrollment, you will most likely be automatically enrolled in your current plan. However, it’s always a good idea to check out Covered California’s website and shop around for a better deal!  Use Covered California’s online “Shop and Compare” tool for a side-by-side comparison of your current plan’s rates and the rates of other plans for 2018. Remember, if you want your coverage to start on January 1, 2018, you must sign up by December 15, 2017. So don’t wait until the last minute to #GetCovered!

This scam is nothing more than a kickback for the billionaires' boys club that would have made Leona Helmsley proud since it comes entirely at the expense of the ""little people,"" including hard-working middle class Americans and all Californians, but especially my constituents in the 14th District.   The vast majority of the tax breaks in this scam will go to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. Middle- and low-income families will see their tax bills increase, and the deficit will increase by $1.5 trillion.    This plan also unfairly singles out states with higher taxes, including our own state of California. By completely eliminating the state and local income tax deduction, and capping the property tax deduction, California families are being unfairly forced to carry the burden for a select few. Households in California’s 14th Congressional District take an average State and Local Tax deduction of nearly $35,000, which is now under grave threat thanks to the Republicans.    This scam also targets areas with high costs of living, like our 14th District and the entire Bay Area. This includes cutting the interest deduction for new mortgages in half, from $1 million to $500,000, which is well below the median home value of $1.4 million in San Mateo County.

One killing is too many, let alone 25. This brutality must end. Unfortunately, transgender people have also come under attack from President Trump, who uses hateful and false rhetoric to try to exclude them from the military, from employment, from health care, and from society and life in general.

This improperly obtained information has been used in court against Americans charged with crimes that have nothing to do with national security, with no warrants and without the required notifications to the defense.

Since then, The House has held 39 identical moments of silence. Each time, I am struck by the hypocrisy of Members of Congress gathering to honor these lost innocent lives, and then failing to take any meaningful action to prevent future tragedies. Moments of silence are literally the least we can do. Instead of remaining silent, we must take meaningful action to end preventable deaths from gun violence. The families of the victims mourn in this silence every day. They speak out for sane gun violence prevention laws to a silent Congress. But Congress can and should act.  We can start by closing many of the loopholes that benefit the gun manufacturing industry and its lobbyists. The vast majority of Americans, even gun owners, support commonsense background checks. It is clear that assault weapons have no place in civilian hands. And it is past time that we lift the ban on gun violence research. As we honor those lost in Newtown today, let us recommit ourselves to passing common-sense gun safety solutions and end the silence.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JackieSpeier/photos/a.175087211976.131230.99332606976/10156000099381977/?type=3",NA,107,13,22,14,0,0,67,1

And I rejected the strings attached to assistance for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which demonstrate a stunning disregard for American citizens who are still without adequate shelter, electricity, and potable water.

Join me for my next Conversation about America with sociologist and bestselling author Arlie Russell Hochschild. Professor Hochschild will discuss her latest book, Strangers in Their Own Land, with me and answer your questions. In Strangers in Their Own Land, Professor Hochschild takes readers on a thought-provoking journey from her liberal hometown Berkeley, California to Louisiana bayou country, a stronghold of the Tea Party and the conservative right. For five years she meets and gets to know people who strongly oppose many of her ideas and beliefs, but she still manages to find common ground with them about concerns that all Americans share: the desire for community, the embrace of family, and hopes for their children. Strangers in Their Own Land was a finalist for the National Book Award 2016 and one of “6 Books to Understand Trump’s Win” according to the New York Times the day after the election. Seating at this town hall is limited to exactly 516 seats due to the theater’s capacity. Please register one person per registration. You will need to bring your ticket (electronic or paper) to be admitted. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. This is my 9th town hall and I will continue to hold them throughout my district, so there will be more opportunities if you can't get into this event. We will also stream it live on Facebook. I am looking forward to a fascinating discussion about our country with my special guest Arlie Hochschild!","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/1844274295836503/",NA,78,9,0,0,0,0,0,0
