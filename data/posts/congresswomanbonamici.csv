President Assad’s history of brutality against his own people has created a desperate humanitarian crisis with implications around the world. The international community must address the blatant war crimes being committed in Syria and work together to provide additional aid and shelter to the refugees of this horrific conflict.  The decision to use our military in conflicts overseas is complex. Although the U. S. response taken yesterday was done without Congressional input or approval, which raises serious questions, it is imperative that the Trump Administration adhere to U.S. law and seek Congressional authorization for any further use of military force. President Trump’s policy on involvement in Syria and in conflicts across the globe has been erratic. He must now present a clear plan to Congress and to the American people before moving forward with any other action.  I also call for the Trump Administration to reconsider the short-sighted decision to close U.S. borders to desperate refugees seeking shelter, and I strongly urge the Administration to reverse its proposal to slash the State Department’s diplomatic budgets. Our country must work with our international allies to create stability in the region with a comprehensive approach to ending violence, providing humanitarian aid, and dismantling ISIS.","link","http://bonamici.house.gov/press-release/bonamici-statement-us-airstrikes-syria","bonamici.house.gov",219,35,20,8,1,2,0,6
