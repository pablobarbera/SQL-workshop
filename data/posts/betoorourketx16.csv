If they pass it, the House must vote on sending it to conference where members of both chambers create one bill from the two current versions -- one in the House and one in the Senate. This vote would be held on the evening of Monday, December 4.   Unfortunately, that means we have to postpone the previously scheduled town hall. The monthly town hall will now occur on Saturday, December 9 at 1:00 p.m. My apologies for the change. Hope to see you on Saturday the 9th.

This is the first time that both an agency within the Department of Defense and the Department of Interior have made a joint commitment to the community of El Paso on this issue.  The Army has committed to prioritizing cleanup of the higher elevation, western portion of Castner Range, ensuring preservation in perpetuity and allowing for eventual access where it is safe and respectful to the unique conditions that remain on Castner Range. This commitment reflects the Army’s understanding of El Paso’s interest to permanently protect Castner Range and to have access to areas that are safe.  In addition, the Army and Bureau of Land Management have agreed to work with each other to review the historical, natural, and cultural values within Castner Range and why they may warrant a future national monument designation.  Finally, the Department of Army has committed to cleanup alternatives outside of complete remediation of the land. This includes considering parceling portions of Castner Range for future public access, while preserving other portions of the land for specific use.   What began 50 years ago with a few people has marched to more than 35,000 people across El Paso who support preserving the crown jewel of West Texas forever.

This bill does two major things. The first is make permanent the Hyde Amendment which bans federal dollars from being used for abortion services. The second effectively takes away reproductive rights for women by prohibiting federal facilities and doctors from providing legal abortion services.   Specifically, this bill prohibits individuals and small businesses from receiving federal subsidies and tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to purchase health care plans that cover abortions.   Women, not Congress, should make the best decisions for their health and the health of their families without government interference  H.R. 7 violates this principle and is unprecedented in attempting to cut off the purchase of health coverage.

Stopping Syrians fleeing the worst slaughter and forced migration the world has seen in decades is inhumane. And building walls between the U.S. and Mexico will humiliate one of our closest economic and security partners in the world.   All of these actions make our country less safe, not more. They make us weaker, not stronger. They ignore the best in who we are to embrace the worst.   Today I joined my colleague Grace Meng in co-sponsoring the ""No Funds for Unconstitutional Executive Orders Act” which will prohibit the President from using religion to determine which refugees and immigrants are accepted into the United States.   I will continue to work with my colleagues to find ways to stop what's un-American and offer proposals for what makes us stronger.

David Petraeus -- who led the surge in Iraq and the surge in Afghanistan, who was formerly the director of the CIA -- was a witness today at a hearing entitled “The State of the World”.  His opening statement provides one of the clearest, most compelling cases for the international world order that the United States fought for during World War II and which we have secured in the 70+ years that followed. And it provides one of the most sobering accounts of what’s at stake if we do not improve our approach to the rest of the world, sooner than later.  He warns against:  - “The spiral of protectionism” - Loss of “strategic clarity” - Actions that might give Islamic extremists “ammunition” to portray our fight against ISIS as a “clash of civilizations”  And the need to:  - Complement our military strategy in the Middle East with a robust political/diplomatic strategy to ensure that we address the underlying issues in those countries that could lead to “Al Qaeda 3.0” - Capitalize on our friendships and alliances (not alienate them) - Confront “egregious violations of the most basic principles of the international order”   His closing comments give me some hope and put our current challenges in context with the most trying time in the history of the world (1930s and 1940s):  “I began my remarks today by evoking a dark time in the history of mankind. Yet it was only at our darkest hour in the 1940s that we summoned the imagination and determination to build the world order of which all of us here today have been the lucky heirs. Perhaps it is in the nature of humanity that, only when we came to grasp fully how bad things could be, were we capable of galvanizing ourselves to set them right.”   Please take 10 minutes to read his full statement here: https://goo.gl/CXPpB6  Or watch him deliver that statement by video here:  https://youtu.be/7XmNbxAZyXw?t=12m52s","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/photos/a.463064457092746.102308.460776160654909/1389552334443949/?type=3",NA,100,8,26,7,0,0,0,0

He's been fantastic. He's been innovative in meeting the challenges he faced from day one. He's engaged, responsive, transparent and has been focused on the critical aspects of VA's healthcare mission. While there is a lot more to do, in his short time he has already improved the access, quality and timeliness of the care the VA delivers.   Dr. Shulkin represents the best in public service and is an outstanding choice for VA secretary. His commitment to strengthen the VA; his opposition to privatization; his determination to fulfill every commitment this country has made to our veterans; and his ability to bring technology, resources, and  — most importantly:  accountability — to bear on the mission of the VA is exactly what our veterans need now.  Following today's confirmation hearing, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move his nomination forward, confirm him and let him start working on the many significant challenges and opportunities in the VA.   Please share this if you'd like to see Dr. Shulkin as our new VA secretary.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/photos/a.463064457092746.102308.460776160654909/1389712434427939/?type=3",NA,92,5,10,1,0,0,0,0

Edgar is a U.S. citizen, a constituent of mine and the proud husband of Maricruz (I had the chance to join them when they were married on international line of the Paso del Norte bridge). But because Maricruz has an immigration law violation on her record, she cannot join her husband in the U.S. and raise their U.S.-citizen children in our community.  When she was an adolescent she crossed with her adult sister into the U.S. and her sister falsely claimed U.S. citizenship at the port of entry.  This triggered an automatic life-time ban on reentry into the U.S. While she definitely broke the law as a child, and there have to be consequences for it, many would argue that being barred for life -- despite having a U.S.-citizen family -- goes too far. Thanks to Edgar attending one of my first town hall meetings to bring this to my attention, we have been working on a solution to this problem that is fair to all concerned.  Today I re-introduced the bipartisan American Families United Act (H.R. 1036) with Congressman Steve Pearce of New Mexico and Congressman Eric Swallwell of California.   This bill brings common sense to our immigration laws by providing case-by-case judicial discretion in instances where an individual is a spouse, parent, or child of a U.S. citizen and would be eligible to adjust their status if not for a previous minor immigration violation and when inadmissibility or removal would present a hardship to a U.S. citizen.   In other words -- if a federal judge thinks that Maricruz poses a lifetime threat to the United States, that judge can uphold a lifetime ban on reetnry. Or, that judge can determine a more commensurate punishment that allows her to ultimately join her U.S.-citizen family in the United States.  While this addresses just one part of our broken immigration system, it’s my hope that this targeted legislation will help Edgar and Maricruz as well as the thousands of American families currently separated by outdated immigration laws that don't match our values.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/photos/a.463064457092746.102308.460776160654909/1401402103258972/?type=3",NA,964,111,176,196,1,9,3,2

That is why today I reintroduced two bipartisan bills to help address these challenges.   The first is the Mental Health Care Provider Retention Act, which will provide service members receiving mental health care from the Department of Defense the option of keeping their provider upon their exit from the military.  Too many veterans cannot get in to see a mental health provider. For example the first year we started measuring this, 37%  of veterans surveyed could not get a mental health care appointment at the El Paso VA.    Having an established relationship with a single, trusted mental health care provider ultimately helps our veterans get better. This bill will help ensure that can happen.   The second bill is the Veteran Prescription Continuity Act. This bill will help ensure service members can get the same prescription drugs they are receiving on active duty once they leave the military and get their health care through the VA.  Our military heroes should receive the best medicines regardless of whether they are on active duty or a veteran. Right now there’s no guarantee a patient can be prescribed the same drug by a VA doctor as a DoD doctor unless that medication is for post-traumatic stress or chronic pain.  The Veteran Prescription Continuity Act requires the VA and DoD to work together to ensure a veteran can access the same prescriptions he or she received while on active duty, regardless of the condition being treated.  My thanks to Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina and Congressman Mike Coffman of Colorado for joining me in introducing these common sense bills for our veterans.","status",NA,NA,107,7,18,10,0,0,0,0

Good sentiment, no details and non controversial.   But the heart of the speech was a celebration of nativism and protectionism couched as patriotism. Fear of the rest of the world and vilification of immigrants sold as security and public safety.  Describing our homeland security policy as: “leaving our borders wide open for anyone to cross” is a perfect example. We have 600 miles of walls and fences. We’ve doubled the size of the Border Patrol in the last 15 years. We’re spending 10 times more on border security ($19.5 billion) than we did 25 years ago. We have the lowest levels of north-bound apprehensions; and those we are apprehending are for the most part economic migrants, families trying to unite with loved ones and children fleeing for their lives from the deadliest countries in the world.  We will always have threats unique to our border, including human smuggling and drug trafficking. Thanks to Border Patrol, Customs and ICE we combat these challenges every day and have helped contribute to the safety of our community, our state and our country.  Coming from the safest city in the country, at a time that the border has never been more secure, our borders are definitely not “wide open.”  In another passage the president quoted Lincoln to advocate for protectionism against trade from the rest of the world. I can agree with smarter trade agreements, fairer trade agreements, but when we start raising tariffs against products from the rest of the world then the rest of the world raises tariffs against us. The things that we produce and manufacture become more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets; that means fewer, not more, jobs in high-skill, high-wage export manufacturing and services.  This was related to other moments in the speech essentially questioning America’s commitment to the international order that we’ve done so much to win (World War II), secure (Cold War) and expand (post-Cold War). We can give all of that up -- but a world dominated by disconnection, with former allies and trading partners who have thrown up massive trade barriers and no longer come to each others’ mutual defense is not a safe nor a prosperous world for the United States.  Lastly, and most disturbingly was this passage:  “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.”  Any violent crime and any murder is cause for concern. And certainly no undocumented immigrant who has committed a serious crime should remain in this country or be allowed to re-enter this country.  But we should remember that immigrants -- documented and undocumented -- commit crimes at lower levels than the native-born U.S. citizen population. This is not about public safety or fighting the “special interests” that he claims have covered up immigrant crimes.  This is part of a larger pattern of referring to Mexican immigrants as “rapists”, of claiming a Mexican-American judge is unable to do his job because of his heritage and of constantly stoking anxiety and fear about Mexicans, immigrants and the border with Mexico.  Unfortunately this President takes another step into a dark world of fear, isolation and separation. Up to us to decide if we will follow.","status",NA,NA,824,71,304,69,2,3,48,9

Fact:  · The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relies on community doctors to supplement care for veterans.  · With 43,000 unfilled positions, the VA is going to continue to refer care out to the community to be successful.  The Problem:  · Even though the VA is referring care to doctors outside of the VA, there are barriers to sharing a patient’s medical record.  · This creates delays in care and is frustrating to both doctors and veterans.  · Doctors aren’t getting the full medical picture for the veterans they treat.  We Can Fix This:  · Today I introduced the Vet Connect Act, bicameral legislation with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. This legislation will reduce bureaucratic red tape at the VA to more easily share a veteran’s medical record with doctors outside of the VA who are directly involved in that veteran’s medical care, while maintaining HIPPA protections.  · By removing this hurdle we can help doctors and patients make better decisions about their health care.","status",NA,NA,48,3,4,2,0,0,1,0

It will reduce the number of Texans who currently have access to health care, roll back benefits, and make health insurance less affordable.  I also acknowledge that the current law (ACA or Obamacare) is not good enough. Although the ACA has helped more than a million Texans gain access to health care, it is far from perfect. It has still not fully addressed access to doctors or the ability of small clinics and individual practitioners to stay in business. We also see cases of premium increases, deductible size and coverage gaps effectively denying coverage to far too many. We’ve also seen a decrease in the number of insurance companies participating in the health care exchanges throughout the United States.  That is why earlier this year I convened a roundtable with health care providers, small business owners and health care leaders in El Paso to get their suggestions on how to improve the ACA.  I have outlined those suggestions in a preliminary letter sent to Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady and Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Greg Walden, which you can read below.  Neither Democrats nor Republicans can or should address health care unilaterally. Hopefully we’ve learned something from 2010. I offer these suggestions and my willingness to work to improve access, timeliness, cost and outcomes in our nation’s health care to all of my colleagues regardless of party.  I’m confident that working together we can do better than either the status quo or the proposed replacement.  Likewise, I will keep an open mind and will approach with good faith the proposals from my colleagues even if (and maybe especially) they don’t see things exactly the way I do. I believe in this country and the basic desire we all have to get this right.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/photos/a.587601521305705.1073741833.460776160654909/1424214137644435/?type=3",NA,184,15,15,4,0,0,4,0

King, Jr. This bill will increase transparency in political campaigns and elections by  allowing the public to see the connections between the donors, the policymakers and the policies our government pursues.  In the wake of The Supreme Court’s decision in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (FEC), wealthy donors have been able to give unlimited amounts to political campaigns, parties and candidates. While it will take an amendment to the constitution to stop big money in politics, this bill at least ensures that we know who is funding campaigns in this new era of unlimited donations. It requires that all contributions of $1,000 or more are reported and published within 48-hours. Without this legislation, a single donor will be able to contribute millions of dollars cumulatively to members of Congress and their parties on the eve of a vote that would impact that individual’s particular interest and the public would be none the wiser for up to 3 months afterwards.

At a time when 20 veterans a day are taking their own lives, its more important than ever that veterans have access to prompt, quality care. The VA cannot deliver that when it is struggling to implement disciplinary procedures. According to the Government Accountability Office it takes an average of six months to a year to remove a civil servant in the federal government.   Today I voted for the VA Accountability First Act (H.R.1259) which shortens the notification and review period for demotion and removal, while preserving an employee’s due process right to file an appeal with the merit systems protection board and ultimately an administrative law judge.  This will preserve due process, allow the VA to ensure that it has the right people in the right place, and let the VA focus on its mission of caring for and being accountable to veterans.","status",NA,NA,133,12,10,10,0,0,1,1
"betoorourketx16","460776160654909_1429761047089744","Congressman Beto O'Rourke","2017-03-16","2017-03-16 23:45:17","We voted today on HR 1181, a bill that seeks to address access to guns by veterans who have been judged to be unable to manage their affairs and their finances by a healthcare professional at the VA.  This is one of the toughest votes I’ve taken, and I will tell you why.  Currently, the law says that a veteran who has a named fiduciary through the VA -- because they have been judged incapable of managing their own affairs -- will have their name included in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). This makes it much harder for them to purchase a gun.  HR 1181 removes the requirement of forwarding this information to NICS and ensures that veterans in this situation will easily be able to buy a gun. I was initially persuaded by the arguments of many of my colleagues that this bill is necessary because current law might discourage veterans from seeking mental healthcare.  After all, with more than 20 veterans taking their lives each day, we want to do everything we can to persuade veterans to come in to the VA if they need mental health care. We don’t want them to have a reason not to come in, such as a fearing a mental incompetence determination that might keep them from purchasing a gun.  But as I talked with more of my colleagues today and had a chance to listen to more veterans who are concerned about suicide, I learned that this bill, while well intentioned, will likely do more harm than good. I voted against it.  These were some of the facts that I considered in coming to this conclusion:  - More than 2/3rds of veteran suicides are committed through the use of a firearm.   - There are tens of thousands of veterans diagnosed with dementia, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s who are on the NICS list, and who would now be able to purchase a firearm.  - Last year we passed the 21st Century Cures Act which ensures due process protections for veterans who are in the process of having a fiduciary named for them, by providing the opportunity to present evidence, be represented by counsel at incompetency hearings, and present new evidence during the appeals process.  While the process to determine a veteran’s mental competence is not perfect, this bill would functionally remove any ability for the VA to keep veterans who are a danger to themselves from purchasing a firearm.  This was tough vote, because there are strong arguments on both sides. I was originally convinced that the bill would be helpful in ensuring that more veterans use VA mental health services. And I am sympathetic to the concern that the current process to add someone to the NICS list or to remove them is not perfect. But removing every veteran from that list and failing to provide an alternative method to ensuring that those who are a danger to themselves do not readily have the ability to buy a gun is not the way to do it.   One quick note regarding the stigma associated with seeking mental health care - it’s important to know that simply being diagnosed with a mental illness will not automatically add a veteran to the NICS list.   My gratitude to all the members of the committee who worked on this issue with me, and to the veterans and retired military leaders (see documents below) who gave me their thoughts and advice.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/photos/a.463064457092746.102308.460776160654909/1429760480423134/?type=3",NA,251,60,26,23,0,1,1,3

Currently the VA is not allowed to recruit medical residents until their last year of residency, despite the fact that most residents begin considering career options much earlier. That means that too often instead of going to work for the VA they are recruited by other hospitals and medical centers who don't have this same restriction. I wrote an amendment to allow the VA to make conditional job offers with two years left in a residency. Here's the play by play below.","video","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/videos/1430376077028241/",NA,363,34,36,32,0,0,0,0

This figure shows an unacceptable gap in healthcare coverage for our nation’s most vulnerable veterans. A meaningful step toward closing that gap would be to extend mental healthcare benefits to those former service members with “other-than-honorable” (or, “bad paper”) discharges, which currently affects 500,000 former service members. Most veterans with this discharge status are unable to access healthcare services from the VA, and often are unable to appeal the nature of their discharge in a timely way. In fact, over 125,000 veterans who served since 2001 are unable to access basic veteran services, even though the VA has never completed an evaluation of their service.   This is especially troubling given that many of these veterans with bad paper discharges had diagnosed mental health issues while still in service. According to figures acquired by NPR in October of 2015 under the Freedom of Information Act, the Army had been improperly dismissing soldiers with diagnosed mental health issues at an alarming rate. The figures show that since January 2009, the Army has “separated” 22,000 soldiers for “misconduct” after they came back from Iraq and Afghanistan and were diagnosed with mental health problems or TBI. These are the veterans who need access to mental healthcare the most and due to the nature of their discharge are prevented from doing so.   Two weeks ago, the VA Secretary announced that it would begin providing “urgent care” mental health services for veterans with bad paper. Unfortunately, I have since learned that the services they intend to offer will be limited.   This is why today, along with Senator Chris Murphy, I introduced the Honor Our Commitment Act of 2017.   This bipartisan, bicameral bill would make it possible for veterans with bad paper discharges to get full access to mental healthcare at the VA if they were diagnosed with a mental health issue while in service or within five years of leaving service. In order to prevent another backlogged appeals process in which veterans are waiting to receive care, the bill also ensures that veterans receive a decision in a timely way and requires the VA to justify to Congress any denial of benefits that they issue to a veteran.","status",NA,NA,232,26,55,21,0,1,44,1

Today, I voted for the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act (H.R. 372) which would eliminate this antitrust exemption.  This will help promote competition and choice amongst insurers.

For the rest of us — we’ve put the expense on the national credit card to be paid by future generations.   Harvard’s Linda Bilmes found that over the next 40 to 50 years, the costs related to health care and disability compensation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will be nearly a trillion dollars.  Further, peak costs occur decades after the end of the conflict. For example, the peak costs for World War I veterans was in 1969; the largest expenditures for World War II veterans were in the late 1980s; and costs for Vietnam and first Gulf War veterans are still climbing.   We are failing to account for the true cost of war and in turn failing to ensure the necessary resources are available to care for our nation’s veterans.   That is why today I introduced the bipartisan Veterans Health Care Trust Fund Act which will require everyone in this country to participate in paying for the full cost of our wars — most importantly, taking care of our veterans — as we wage them. Those not required to pay into the trust fund are those who have already paid far more in service to our country – our service members and veterans.   Taking steps to address these costs now ensures that Congress fully accounts for these costs when considering the use of military force and that our nation is better postured to address the long term and unforeseen health care needs of its veterans.","status",NA,NA,412,31,86,37,1,1,26,3

UTEP was the first institution to implement a Spanish-English bilingual training program for physical therapy in the nation. Evelyn’s research on the results of the program shows that this training benefits the students and community by lowering the language barriers and thus facilitating access to culturally sensitive health care in Hispanic-majority communities, which are often underserved.   Evelyn was joined by her mother Veronica Villarreal and stressed the importance of higher education and the grants and scholarships which make college affordable to everyone.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BetoORourkeTX16/photos/a.463064457092746.102308.460776160654909/1474222829310232/?type=3",NA,366,8,36,29,0,1,0,0

While not perfect, it is a genuine compromise between Republicans and Democrats and overall it serves our country’s interest.     Key points to know:   • U.S. Service Members at Fort Bliss and around the world get a pay increase of 2.1%, an increase from the 1.6% requested by the Obama Administration. Moreover, this bill blocks any decrease in troop levels.  • Students at UTEP, El Paso Community College and other institutions of higher learning will see the reinstatement of year-round Pell grants, which give approximately one million students an additional Pell grant of on average $1,650 dollars.  • The National Institutes of Health will see a $2 billion dollar increase in funding to help them in their mission to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat disease and disability.  • The bill provides an additional 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who took on interpreting or other duties alongside the U.S. military after the 9/11 attacks and face retribution from the Taliban as a result.  • The Veterans Employment and Training Program is funded to the tune of $279 million dollars, an $8 million dollar increase over last year.  • It does not include funding to construct a new border wall, which shows reasonable voices of both parties understand that the wall is a poor use of resources and not needed at a time when the U.S.-Mexico border has never been safer. However, the bill does include $341 million dollars to replace and repair approximately 40 miles of existing pedestrian and vehicle fencing along the border. This money would be better spent going to expedite legitimate trade and travel. I will work to help ensure that no future funding goes to border walls.   The bill passed the House by a vote of 309-118, it is now off to the Senate where it is expected to pass and be signed by the President before the continuing resolution runs out on Friday at midnight.","status",NA,NA,462,38,56,24,0,0,0,3

Like the original version of the bill, which failed to garner enough support for a vote in March, AHCA seeks to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with a system of tax credits and Medicaid block grants.  In the March version of the bill we knew that:  - 81,000 fewer El Pasoans would have health care  - 2.5 million fewer Texans would have health care  - 24 million fewer Americans would have health care  - Americans would see premium increases of 15–20% in 2018 and 2019  - Millions of veterans not enrolled in the VA would lose health care  - Fewer resources would be available to combat the opioid crisis  - There would be no requirement for mental health parity  - Women’s reproductive health would be defunded  The most notable changes to this version of the bill are two amendments. First, the McArthur Amendment, which allows states to determine the minimum coverage in the health care plans they offer. Currently, the ACA requires insurers to cover a host of essential health benefits like hospital stays, mental health, and maternity care. This amendment will allow insurers to consider health status when setting prices. This will directly impact patients with pre-existing conditions and older Americans who will be charged more for coverage.  The second amendment is the Upton Amendment. It adds $8 billion over 5 years to the bill to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for their insurance and health care needs. Unfortunately that is nowhere near enough and if implemented many people will soon find it difficult to pay for their health care needs.  There has been no updated analysis of this new version of the bill because it was rushed through without an official score from the Congressional Budget Office.  I voted against the bill which passed the House by a vote of 217-213. It now goes to the Senate where it meets an uncertain fate.","status",NA,NA,2811,367,522,250,2,12,255,64

Should North Korea successfully develop this capability, the U.S. would face an unacceptable threat. The U.S. and partner nations have attempted to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations for decades through adding sanctions, removing sanctions, trade, and diplomacy, but none have so far been successful.  That is why today I voted for the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act (H.R. 1644). This bipartisan bill expands existing sanctions against the North Korean government by extending sanctions against individuals and companies who buy coal, iron, textiles, fishing rights, military-use fuel, or certain agricultural products from North Korea. These items represent some of North Korea’s only means to obtain the funds necessary to fund their government and weapons programs. Thus this legislation could apply pressure to disrupt the timeline for North Korea’s weapons development. The legislation also prevents organizations who provide financial services to North Korea from doing business in the United States.  I support the extensive use of diplomacy as a frontline approach to settle foreign disputes peacefully. The United States must continue to work with its partners to resolve this situation. I will continue to work with my colleagues and the White House to try to find a peaceful, diplomatic agreement to ensure North Korea does not develop nuclear weapons capable of reaching the United States.   I voted for this bill which passed 419-1.","status",NA,NA,228,41,22,5,0,1,8,1

Today, that felt insufficient and the topic of discussion – helping veterans overcome PTSD – too valuable not to share in its entirety.   This morning’s discussion could be the first of many that will meaningfully reframe the way we talk about and address PTSD – not simply as a clinical diagnosis, but as a far more complex adjustment issue that deserves both rehabilitation and empowerment. Importantly, this hearing made plain that as a community, we have a responsibility to help support and reintegrate the less than 1-percent of our fellow Americans that have assumed the burden of war on our behalf.   Of course, not all invisible wounds can be addressed holistically. We know that access to timely and effective mental healthcare is a key component of reducing veteran suicide. This begins with ensuring our VA facilities have the resources to hire and retain the necessary mental healthcare providers. However, we also know that of the 20 veterans a day that are committing suicide, 14 of those are not receiving healthcare from the VA. This figure betrays an unacceptable gap in healthcare coverage for our nation’s most vulnerable veterans.    A meaningful step toward closing this gap would be to extend mental healthcare benefits to those former service members with “other-than-honorable” (or, “bad paper”) discharges, as most veterans with this discharge status are unable to access healthcare services from the VA.   This is especially troubling given that according to data from the Department of Defense, 62-percent, or 57,141 of the service members separated for misconduct from 2011 through 2015 had been diagnosed within the 2 years prior to their separation with PTSD, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or other mental health conditions that could be associated with misconduct.  These figures, especially in the context of the accounts we heard this morning, emphasize why it is more important now than ever to enact the Honor our Commitment Act (H.R. 1685), legislation authored by Congressman O’Rourke and Senator Chris Murphy that would extend VA mental health coverage for these former service members, and provide access to care for those veterans who need it the most.   We hope you’ll find the remarks from this morning’s hearing as meaningful as we did, and that we can work together to ensure returning service members receive the support and dignity they deserve. I am grateful for Brendan O’Byrne, a United States Army Veteran; Sebastian Junger, an American journalist and the author of Tribe; Zach Iscol, a United States Marine Corps Veteran and Executive Director of the Headstrong Project; and Paul Downs, a United States Marine Corps Veteran and staff member of the Boulder Crest Retreat Team for their testimony and tireless dedication to helping our nation’s veterans overcome PTSD.

At the current hiring rate, CBP vets 150–200 applicants just to hire one officer or agent, and the agency is currently short 1,000 officers at our ports of entry and 1,800 agents. If we want to capitalize on our relationship with Mexico and Canada, increase trade, reduce wait times and improve quality of life for people who live along our country’s borders we need to make sure that CBP has the tools it needs to hire efficiently and effectively.   That is why I voted in support of the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2213), which gives the CBP Commissioner authority to waive the polygraph exam on a case-by-case basis for certain applicants. For example, if a veteran with 3 years of honorable service previously held a security clearance and passed a background check during time in the military, the CBP Commissioner could on a case-by-case basis opt to waive the polygraph test for the position. The veteran would still be subject to 11 other hiring requirements. The Commissioner could also do this for local, state, and federal law enforcement personnel who meet high standards of service and have passed background checks throughout their careers. This should help speed up the hiring process and provide the CBP Commissioner additional authorities to recruit and hire quality CBP officers and Border Patrol agents.    I voted for this bill which passed the House by a vote of 282–137.","status",NA,NA,213,30,26,7,1,11,0,2

The first is the Veterans Equal Treatment Ensures Relief and Access Now (VETERAN) Act (H.R. 2372), which will ensure that those veterans not enrolled in the VA will still be eligible for tax credits to help pay for health insurance. The bill passed by voice vote. The second is the Broader Options for Americans Act (H.R. 2579) which will allow individuals to use tax credits to help pay for COBRA coverage, allowing them to temporarily stay on their employer’s health insurance after their job ends. The bill passed 267- 144. I will continue to fight to stop the AHCA, preserve and improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and work for a true universal health care solution.","status",NA,NA,245,21,17,10,0,1,13,4

This week the House passed the Verify First Act (H.R. 2581). This bill would make the verification process more onerous to those in need, by requiring additional confirmation from the Secretary of the Treasury of an individual's eligibility. These additional hurdles make it more difficult for an individual to get affordable health care and could mean the inability to access timely life-saving treatment for someone who is ill.

Simply put: the bill is immoral and impractical and its passage would be a disaster for Texans.   It's important to remember that in 2009, on the eve of the Affordable Care Act, there were nearly 40 million uninsured in America with many more surviving on inadequate insurance plans. Many of those plans had lifetime caps which resulted in termination of care to those who needed it the most. And insurers could refuse coverage to anyone with what they considered to be a preexisting condition (think: cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc.). And costs for patients, taxpayers, employers, and the government were skyrocketing.   The ACA sought to address many of these issues, and while it made significant headway, it certainly wasn't perfect. It could have been written to do a better job controlling premium costs and network competition. However, because of ACA a child born with a congenital disease will never have to go without insurance because she has a preexisting condition. Because of ACA no American fighting for his life has to worry about being refused care because he's exceeded his lifetime cap. And finally, because of ACA tens of millions more Americans have the security of health insurance.   The Senate Republican bill will cause 22 million more to lose that security. By next year, 15 million more people would be uninsured than under current law. It will massively increase out-of-pocket costs for Texans. The bill includes large cuts to Medicaid. And while working Americans are asked to make these sacrifices, the wealthiest Americans will receive an $800 billion-dollar tax cut.   And here's the final, unavoidable truth: people will die unnecessarily. Both common sense and scientific research tell us that when people are uninsured, or have insurance that doesn't cover enough, they forgo basic preventive care. We don't want a mom passing on a mammogram because she's uninsured. Or a father ignoring a pain in his side until it's too late, because he didn't qualify for a subsidy to buy insurance. We want their kids to be healthy, productive and successful. And that becomes much more likely when they have access to the care they need.   I know that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress want what's best for the country. I'm convinced that when their constituents learn what is in this bill, when they understand the great harm that it will do to this country, that they will do the right thing and reject this legislation. In a democracy, it's incumbent upon all of us to do our part to remind them of what's at stake by speaking up, calling in, sharing online, and ultimately — peacefully, democratically — bending the legislation that we produce in Congress to the real needs and opportunities of this country.   I'm grateful to all of you who have done their part and to those who will now make it their priority.","status",NA,NA,231,32,53,17,2,1,29,1

It’s worth noting that the entire process is done in public, shown on CSPAN and live streamed over the web (in contrast to the Senate defense write up which took place at the same time, behind closed doors and in secret.)   Have to begin by saying some really nice but true things: The people I serve with from both parties are, in most cases, doing their best to ensure that we are supporting our service members, being good stewards of taxpayer resources and providing for the national defense. We just don’t always agree on the best way to do it. 94% of the debate was civil, policy-focused and productive. There were some unfortunate moments — like when a colleague argued against allowing transgender Americans from serving in the military — but all in all it was an encouraging display of bipartisanship in an increasingly polarized Congress.   That work was aided — and honestly, in many cases done almost completely by — incredible professional staff from the committee and in our office Frank Pigulski and Mark Walden who always made sure I had the best information on the amendments we voted on and who helped negotiate with the committee our most important amendments — more than once snatching victory from the jaws of defeat by finding common sense workarounds to tough policy differences that arose between our office, the committee and other members.   But I must also say this: while we focused on important issues — like benefits, rocket engines, number of ships in the fleet and the future of our military in space — there was precious little conversation about the wars we are fighting today. Mere minutes in those 14 hours were spent on defining a strategy for the wars we’re fighting, assessing our progress (or lack thereof) and ensuring we have facts to make informed decisions as we prosecute those wars, understanding who it is we’re fighting (and under what legal justification), and guaranteeing that Congress, the press and the public know what we’re doing around the world in the name of the United States of America.   We do our service members, our country and the world in which we operate a grave disservice by not owning our responsibilities and having the tough conversations and making the tough decisions necessary to produce the best outcomes for all concerned. While I was frustrated in my attempts to make progress on these issues in Committee last night, there is more I can do from the floor of the House with members of both parties. I look forward to doing that.   Here’s a quick recap:   • There were over 1,500 legislative proposals from members of the Armed Services Committee and ultimately 330 of them were offered as amendments. • $621 billion was authorized in base Pentagon spending and $74.5 for “Overseas Contingency Operations” or OCO (read: an accounting gimmick used to create a slush fund for defense priorities, much of which should be in the base budget, but is able to slip through under the auspices of “war funding” (and who can be against funding our wars?)  • Army end strength of 486,000 active duty, which is 10,000 soldiers more than currently authorized.   Here are some provisions that we worked on:   1. War casualties report: will require an annual public report on combatant and noncombatant deaths caused by U.S. forces in both areas of active hostilities and outside of areas of active hostilities. As simple as this sounds, it was a bear to get into the bill through an amendment — and I’m grateful for the committee staff, our man on the ground Frank Pigulski and Emerging Threats Committee Chair Elise Stefanik for working this through. This passed as an amendment.   2. Associated Forces Notification: Requires congressional notification and legal justification when the DoD changes the list of associated forces with Al Qaeda and the Taliban under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Essentially, we are at war throughout the larger Middle East using the 2001 AUMF which was passed in the wake of the 9/11. Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump have had to justify these wars against persons and groups other than Al-Qaeda and the Taliban by claiming they are killing “associated forces” (e.g. Al Shahab in Somalia). I wanted to know who those associated forces are and I wanted Congress to be notified when more associated forces are added to the list. This amendment was ruled out of order — apparently the committee feels that just requesting this information brings us into conflict with the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Link to clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS5mzkV6uXE   3. Mental Health Examination: Requires that service members receive a mental health examination before they transition out of the military. This is another effort to reduce veteran suicide and help treat service members for any injuries or conditions caused by their service. This passed as an amendment.   4. Veteran’s Trust Fund: Establishes a general trust fund upon commencement of any war or authorization for use of military force. These funds would be used strictly for medical care, disability compensation, and veteran care for service members who were on active duty during that conflict. Essentially — we are not accounting for — and therefore not paying — the true costs of war, including what we have to spend to ensure that we have the physical and mental health resources to care for our veterans as well as the research and innovation investments that will cure or mitigate the unique conditions that arise from service (e.g. Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome, PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injury, Military Sexual Trauma, etc.). Because this amendment would require help from other committees (including Ways and Means because of tax implications) I had to withdraw the amendment. Link to clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS5mzkV6uXE  5. Presidential Policy Guidance Report: Requires congressional notification whenever the administration makes a change to the Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG) for procedures approving direct action against terrorist targets located outside the U.S. and areas of active hostilities. The PPG is important because it set out a set of checks and balances for determining who we kinetically action (that’s literally the term a defense official used instead of “killed”), and Congress needs to stay updated on what this process is. This was adopted in the bill’s base language.   6. Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization Account: Increases the amount of money in the Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (FSRM) account. This account helps repair and modernize military facilities. When I talked with Fort Bliss about priorities for NDAA, they identified funding to restore and maintain their infrastructure as their most important item. Here’s just one example: last year Fort Bliss needed $121 million for infrastructure at the installation, but only received $77 million. The maintenance backlog at our installation alone has grown to $250 million. I worked to ensure there was a substantial increase in the funding for this account relative to what was requested to help address this backlog, which would help repair buildings around the country.  This was adopted in the bill’s base language.   7. Border Wall: Prevents any DOD funds from being used to plan or build a wall along our border. As the U.S.-Mexico border becomes increasingly militarized, and as the Administration continues to search for money to pay for a proposed wall, this amendment will ensure that it does not come from Pentagon resources.

NIE/JWA Report Language: Encourages the Army to continue to use Fort Bliss for Network Integration Exercises and Joint Warfighting Assessments. These events are valuable for the Army to test and evaluate new equipment and have avoided costs of $1.8 billion since 2011. This passed as an amendment.   9. Castner Range: I was able to get in language that paves way for forever preserving Castner Range, a former military artillery range that El Pasoans have been trying to save since the 1960s. My amendment prevents this beautiful landscape, which includes 7000 acres of some of West Texas’ highest peaks and encompasses three ecosystems, from being developed. This is an important step toward conserving this national treasure, which includes some of the most unique cultural, historical, and natural resources in Texas, and tells an important part of the American story.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS5mzkV6uXE",NA,98,4,16,5,0,2,0,0

This legislation is based on the flawed assumption that requiring state and local authorities to enforce our immigration laws, in addition to the $19 billion a year we already spend on border security and immigration enforcement activities, will somehow make our country safer.  El Paso is one of the safest cities in the United States due in large part to our immigrant population, not in spite of it. Blurring the lines between federal and local law enforcers will erode community trust at the expense of public safety, including making it less likely that immigrants in El Paso will feel comfortable reporting crimes and other offenses to the police for fear of deportation.   On issues like these, I think it’s important that we listen to the experts, including the local law enforcement in El Paso. As El Paso Sheriff Richard Wiles has said: “My job is to deal with the community safety in El Paso and to do that I need the cooperation of everybody here.”  I voted against this bill which passed by a vote of 228-195.","status",NA,NA,199,43,26,5,1,2,37,37

A sprawling bill of authorizations that cover anything connected to the Pentagon, our wars and our service members - it is inherently imperfect and there is much in the bill that I oppose. But as I wrote to you earlier in the month [https://medium.com/@RepBetoORourke/defense-bill-recap-b6e85e7a21fa], we were able to work with our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to make significant improvements and to ensure that we provide strong support to our service members.  As in years past, members tried to insert harmful provisions, including failed attempts to remove benefits from transgender service members and their families; harm wage rates for Americans across the country; and limit the Department of Defense’s ability to purchase alternative fuels. I'm grateful to my colleagues for working with me to defeat those.  And there were certainly disappointments on those issues that I think are central to how this country conducts war. We still don't have a comprehensive strategy for the wars we fight; and I wasn't able to even get a list of our enemies and the legal justification for fighting them in the final bill (a bit in the weeds here, but that was deemed to be the purview of the House Foreign Affairs committee).  But ultimately I decided that finding a way that most Democrats and Republicans could come together, improving the bill where we could, and ensuring that as long as we are at war, we do all that we can to support those whose lives are on the line was reason enough to support.  I worked to have several provisions included, such as: increased funding to rebuild much of our military infrastructure that has fallen into disrepair as a result of our wars; language to help ensure that Castner Range in El Paso cannot be developed, intended to preserve the natural beauty and history of the area for future generations; a new report on combatant and civilian casualties as a result of Department of Defense actions; and a requirement that the DOD assesses the mental health of transitioning service members.  Some additional highlights of the legislation include: a 2.4% pay raise for our service members; newly required strategies (which have been sorely lacking) for several places where we’re fighting, including Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia; and strengthening of our cyber capabilities.","link","https://medium.com/@RepBetoORourke/defense-bill-recap-b6e85e7a21fa","medium.com",121,7,19,3,0,1,5,0

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act (H.R. 3218). This bill would, among other things, ensure that surviving spouses and dependents of service members who died while serving on active duty are able to receive an education through the GI bill. This legislation also eliminates the 15 year deadline to use tuition assistance, which we know has been a key obstacle in veterans accessing their education benefits.    We also approved the Veteran Urgent Mental Healthcare Act (H.R. 918) that would expand the mental healthcare services we offer to veterans with other-than-honorable discharges. As originally drafted, H.R. 918 only offered initial emergency care to these veterans when in crisis. However, I was able to work closely with the bill’s sponsor – Rep. Mike Coffman (R-CO) – to amend the bill and guarantee these veterans are eligible to receive more comprehensive mental healthcare from the VA.   In the midst of a veteran suicide epidemic, it is critical that we provide the VA authority to offer veterans with so-called “bad paper” discharges the potentially lifesaving mental healthcare that they deserve. I am grateful to Rep. Coffman for his leadership on this issue and to Kris Goldsmith and Vietnam Veterans of America for their feedback.   This markup represents the first step toward turning this legislation into law. It is important that we now prioritize consideration of this bill on the House floor, in addition to the “Honor our Commitment Act” – legislation that I introduced with Rep. Mike Bost (R-IL) and Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) that would serve as a necessary complement to H.R. 918 and will ensure that no veteran is deprived of the mental healthcare benefits they have earned.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbZPfrjQ9_I&feature=youtu.be&t=29m28s",NA,75,3,8,5,0,1,0,1

My career goals are guided by my upbringing in our border community, which introduced me to the issues disenfranchised demographics face in our country, and instilled in me a driving desire to find sustainable solutions to these problems. This has led me to rewarding service experiences both at home and abroad, from starting a student-led food bank at UTEP, to spending two years as a Missionary in São Paulo, Brazil. Building upon my academic career, my internship with Congressman O’Rourke has familiarized me with how policy can effectively address the social and economic challenges people endure across our district. Upon graduating in May 2018, I plan to pursue a dual Master’s Degree in Social Work and Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.

Last night, I made my case in front of the Rules Committee to have a few of them made in order.  The first amendment is to prevent the Dept. of Justice from using eminent domain proceedings to take land from private landowners for the purpose of building a border wall. There are many reasons we shouldn't build a border wall, including the fact that it would impact the rights of private citizens.  The other two amendments are related to women's health. One of which is intended to ensure Medicaid dollars do not exclude qualified health care providers who give critical preventative health care for women and essential family planning. The other requires the government to study the reasons for maternal mortality in our country and find ways to help this problem. Texas has the worst maternal mortality rate in the U.S., and this amendment would be an important step in addressing the issue.","video","https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIKubPQVfj8?start=10714&end=10988",NA,364,38,42,44,1,0,0,5

I am currently pursuing a double major in Political Science and Criminal Justice with a concentration in International Politics at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). After graduation, I plan to go to law school at the University of Texas at Austin. I decided to intern with Congressman Beto O’Rourke because I want to gain experience and learn more about my District. Doing this internship has further enhanced my interest in politics and taught me so much about what my community needs.
