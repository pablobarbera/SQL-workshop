We have met personally with the Director of OMB and explained in detail the disaster of Harvey on Texas. Even so, we strongly believe the request is woefully inadequate. Hurricane Harvey and the subsequent flooding events that followed ranks as the second most costly disaster in modern times (the Fukushima Disaster ranks first). While damages are still being determined, estimates currently sit at approximately $190 billion or more. To be clear, this $44 billion proposal, to be split between multiple disaster areas, does not adequately address long-term recovery needs in Texas. The people of Texas need and deserve federal assistance for long-term flood mitigation, which this request does not sufficiently provide. We stand together opposed to this level of funding and will continue to fight to help Texas rebuild.","link","https://farenthold.house.gov/supplemental-disaster-request-woefully-inadequate/","farenthold.house.gov",25,11,3,2,0,1,2,0

This pro-growth, pro-family legislation will help you keep more of your paycheck. It also helps low and middle-income Americans by nearly doubling the standard deduction, lowering the individual tax rates and increasing the child tax credit. I‚Äôm looking forward to this legislation passing the Senate tonight and President Trump signing it into law.","link","http://farenthold.house.gov/congressman-farentholds-statement-passage-tax-cuts-jobs-act-2/","farenthold.house.gov",167,146,12,16,2,0,1,44
