The current bill has a lot of strong elements -- giving the states more flexibility is sound public policy.  Colorado knows better than Washington, DC and anyone who suggests otherwise hasn't been to Washington lately. But we need to tighten some protections for those with preexisting conditions. The critics of the House bill are being totally disingenuous when they say the bill dooms those with preexisting ailments. Individuals with preexisting conditions are guaranteed coverage under the House bill and I like the idea of giving the states flexibility to meet that requirement. But I worry that, under the current language, a small percentage of those with preexisting conditions may not be adequately protected. If House Leadership will work to tighten protections for those with preexisting conditions, I'm a yes on sending this bill to the Senate for further consideration. If not, I'm a no, and we‚Äôll go back to the drawing board to clean up the mess created by the Affordable Care Act.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repmikecoffman/photos/a.10150802117139493.468439.366142384492/10155222007644493/?type=3",NA,95,453,47,5,0,0,0,81

This does not take away from the fact that the Affordable Care Act is failing and American families are hurting. In my conversations with House leadership and the Administration over the last 72 hours, I made it clear that additional language was necessary to protect this vulnerable group.  And I'm sympathetic to leadership's challenge -- getting 216 votes in this highly polarized political environment isn‚Äôt easy. Also, as I have stated in the past, I‚Äôm certainly not going to vote on a bill of this magnitude that hasn't been fully scored by the Congressional Budget Office and whose estimated price tag is unknown.‚Äù","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repmikecoffman/photos/a.10150802117139493.468439.366142384492/10155225022504493/?type=3",NA,782,944,129,102,0,3,1,29
