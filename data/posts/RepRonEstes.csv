Here are the facts about the American Health Care Act (AHCA):  Dismantles the Obamacare taxes that have hurt job creators, increased premium costs, and limited options for patients and health care providers‚Äîincluding taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health-insurance premiums, and medical devices.    Eliminates the individual and employer mandate penalties, which forced millions of workers, families, and job creators into expensive, Obamacare plans that they don‚Äôt want and cannot afford.   Helps young adults access health insurance and stabilize the marketplace by allowing dependents to continue staying on their parents‚Äô plan until they are 26.   Guarantees coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions and bans health insurers from charging a patient with pre-existing conditions higher premiums as long as they maintain continuous coverage, or sign up for new coverage within 63 days of exiting a previous insurance plan.   Establishes a Patient and State Stability Fund and Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, which provides states with $130 billion to design programs that meet the unique needs of their patient populations, help low-income Americans afford health care, and provide a backstop safety net for Americans with pre-existing conditions. This includes $15 billion specifically toward mental health and substance abuse and newborn care.   Modernizes and strengthens Medicaid by transitioning to a ‚Äúper capita allotment‚Äù so states can better serve the patients most in need. The Medicaid reform represents the biggest entitlement reform in a generation and puts the program on a sustainable fiscal path.    Protects current Medicaid beneficiaries receiving health care under the expansion by honoring the enhanced state match they have been receiving, while working to redirect able-bodied adults to private health care so Medicaid can be refocused on helping the most vulnerable.    Empowers individuals and families to spend their health care dollars the way they want and need by enhancing and expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)‚Äînearly doubling the amount of money people can contribute and broadening how people can use it.    Helps Americans access affordable, quality health care by providing a monthly tax credit‚Äî between $2,000 and $14,000 a year‚Äîfor low- and middle-income individuals and families who don‚Äôt receive insurance through work or a government program. Americans can use this tax credit to purchase private, quality coverage of their choice.","status",NA,NA,27,14,16,2,1,0,3,2
