Specifically, it includes a permanent fix for health care benefits for retired coal miners, their widows and other dependents. It also provides $105 million for a second round of funding for the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Pilot Program, which will enable participating states to reclaim AML sites in conjunction with economic development projects. Under the pilot, Kentucky will receive an additional $25 million in 2017. The Omnibus also includes $30 million for the Economic Development Administration to support coal communities and funds the ARC at historic levels. $152 million in ARC funding includes $10 million for high-speed broadband deployment in distressed central Appalachian communities. Finally, the legislation will help put miners back to work by taking important steps to help the coal industry rebound after eight years of job-killing regulations under President Obama.  Our coal communities and coal miners have suffered the heavy burden of financial insecurity for far too long. Retired coal miners can now rest assured that their medical needs will be met, along with their wives and children. They worked long and hard to power this great nation and we should uphold our commitment to take care of them. Likewise, our coal mining communities in Kentucky are working diligently to rebuild after losing more than 13,000 mining jobs over the last eight years. This legislation will provide funding to boost economic development in our coalfields and create jobs where we need them the most.

Since that day, our military leaders have gained valuable experience and intelligence regarding the new evil we face and the unprecedented measures required to prevent future attacks.  I applaud President Trump's determination to defeat terrorism through a new comprehensive strategy that utilizes diplomacy, economic assistance, and our military to deny safe havens for terrorists in Afghanistan and South Asia. With numerous terrorist organizations operating in that region, we must remain vigilant in our national security efforts and learn from past mistakes.  As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, I agree that a winning strategy must include robust diplomacy, responsible foreign assistance, expanded authority and resources for our troops in the field, and strong consequences for any nation that harbors terrorists. I look forward to working with the Administration to ensure that it has the resources necessary to carry out this plan, while also ensuring that we maintain proper oversight on behalf of the American People.","link","https://halrogers.house.gov/press-releases?id=3DB3B2B8-70AD-40E3-9DDC-787452A9D193","halrogers.house.gov",16,5,1,3,0,0,0,0

Over the years, the ARC has provided a lifeline for vital programs in our communities, from connecting more families to clean water and sewer, to now helping rural communities transition into the complex digital economy.

It happened in 2012 when she was only 15 years old. Since then, she has traveled around the world advocating for education for young girls in developing countries, including her homeland of Pakistan. To enhance her efforts, she launched the Malala Fund and the ""YesAllGirls"" campaign for education. In 2014, Malala became the youngest person ever and the first Pakistani to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Most recently, she was appointed as a United Nations Messenger of Peace to promote girls education and was accepted to Oxford University to continue her own studies.
