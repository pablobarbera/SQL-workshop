First, food security is national security. A net-importing nation that can‚Äôt feed itself is dangerously dependent on foreign nations, and Americans who either can‚Äôt access or can‚Äôt afford nutritional foodstuffs have trouble feeding their families or productively participating in the economy. Second, trade is critical for producers during these times of low farm income: we‚Äôve got to work consistently towards opening new foreign markets for U.S. agriculture, new markets like Cuba. And third, we should not attempt to split the nutrition part of the bill from the farm title.

Currently, the Cuban people import more than 80% of their food from places like China and Vietnam. We can easily supply them with better food in less than a quarter of the time.

In November 1952, Staff Sergeant Van Fossen boarded an aircraft and took off from McChord Air Base in Tacoma, Washington to Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska. In mid-flight, the plane disappeared in bad weather near Middleton Island, in the Gulf of Alaska.  Although some wreckage was found, no remains were recovered, and the Department of Defense notified the victim‚Äôs families that they would not have remains to bury.  Van Fossen‚Äôs parents, Linza and Ruby, held a memorial service for their son in Greenbrier at the Macedonia Baptist Church. Though hope seemed lost, the Van Fossen family kept trying to solve the mystery.  For many years, they made efforts to learn about the crash. His sister, Wilma Jean, shared stories about him with her son, Kevin Caid, a Heber Springs native. As Caid got older, these stories inspired him to continue the search for his long-lost uncle.  After some time, Caid was able to retrieve a copy of the accident report from the crash. From there, he began reaching out to as many people as possible to gather as much information as he could regarding his late uncle.  In June 2012, while on a training mission, a Black Hawk Army National Guard unit discovered wreckage only 12 miles away from the original crash site of the C-124. After closer inspection of the spot, it was determined it was indeed the missing plane from 1952.  Finally, in March 2016, Staff Sergeant Robert Dale Van Fossen‚Äôs remains were confirmed found in Alaska. Along with the news of his remains being found, the family was informed that he would be returning home.  I‚Äôm pleased to say that Staff Sergeant Robert Dale Van Fossen finally returned home last month, and at last buried next to his sister, Wilma Jean Caid, at the Cleburne County Memorial Gardens.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRickCrawford/videos/1451995658192040/",NA,35,2,2,1,0,0,0,0

This policy change is not just a missed opportunity for rural America, which would greatly benefit from increased access to the island‚Äôs $2B agricultural imports market. This policy shift also poses an unjustifiable risk to our national security, as further U.S. disengagement opens up opportunities for countries like Iran, Russia, North Korea, and China to gain influence on an island 90 miles off our coast. Finally, restricting travel and trade and limiting our ability to export American democracy and values will hinder efforts to improve human rights and religious liberties in Cuba. I strongly urge reconsideration of this decision, and as policy changes continue, I will work with the President to find more productive ways to bring about the changes we all want to see in Cuba.  https://crawford.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398505","link","https://crawford.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398505","crawford.house.gov",164,75,20,13,0,4,1,10

Arkansas landowners in the path of this construction are at risk of losing their property because of federal overreach.   My concern with Clean Line isn't wind energy itself.

With 2017 postseason in full swing, we can say that ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is going to bat for someone, especially for those who don‚Äôt necessarily have many others on their side. If I‚Äôm not going to bat for Arkansans in addition to voting and speaking, then I‚Äôm doing it wrong.   A healthcare provider told a young man (who we will call Daniel) in my District that they would be pulling his services due to non-payment. Now, Daniel is medically fragile and receives skilled nursing care at his own home. He has Medicare, Medicaid and ChampVA, a Veterans Administration program for spouses and children of veterans.     Most people don‚Äôt think to call their Representative when they are in a bind, particularly the self-reliant people who live in the 1st District. But for people who need help navigating large federal bureaucracies and programs, my office can step in and advocate on their behalf. Like many others, Daniel didn‚Äôt call my office himself, but once someone mentioned his situation to my office, we started to do some digging.   Let me explain a little about what we learned about Daniel‚Äôs situation. Medicare does not cover the services he receives; however, if Medicare issues an explanation of benefits (EOB) denial, then ChampVA will pay his cost instead.   My office contacted Medicare and ChampVA to explain Daniel‚Äôs situation. ChampVA told us that only when they receive the denial letter from Medicare will they start paying the bills. As it turns out, Daniel actually had another healthcare provider before his current one, but his past provider had pulled their services because ChampVA owed him almost $120,000 in unpaid claims. The Veterans Administration had a denial letter from the old provider, but could not use it to pay the current provider.   After that first talk with the agencies, Daniel‚Äôs mother told my office that everything was going to be resolved. But the very next day, we learned that was not the case and that Daniel‚Äôs current provider, his newer one, was pulling healthcare coverage that day. That was going to be the second provider to bail on Daniel.  My office started making calls that very day, and we were finally able to get Medicare, ChampVA, and his provider all on the same page. The provider agreed not to pull care, the VA assured Daniel‚Äôs mother that they would be paid, and Medicare agreed to send whatever the VA needed in order to pay for coverage.  Currently, everything is fine and Daniel didn‚Äôt experience a lapse in his coverage.   As a side note, when my office questioned ChampVA regarding Daniel‚Äôs past provider‚Äôs non-payment, the VA told us that there were 123 (yes, you read that correctly) outstanding claims and that they would begin processing those claims immediately for payment.

In a word, she was frustrated. Like so many of us, she had decided that she had had enough of Washington. Despite the fact that she read the news, called her Federal and State Representatives, encouraged others to vote, and did everything she could as an educated member of a democratic society, she had lost her faith in the ability of regular citizens to make a difference. Washington seemed too entrenched, too far removed from the needs and values of many Americans.  Like so many others, myself included, she was sick with the feeling that the government wasn‚Äôt getting the job done. But perhaps most of all, she felt powerless. Despite her passions, beliefs, and energy, she couldn‚Äôt seem to effect change in any meaningful way.  Born in Newport, New Hampshire in 1788, Sarah Hale was one of the most successful and popular writers in her time. She was also a strong advocate of women‚Äôs education, and in her role as editor of Godey‚Äôs Lady‚Äôs Magazine, she sought to help educate women so that ‚Äúeach individual may lend her aid to the intellectual and moral character of those within her sphere.‚Äù Among her many writings was her collection Poems for Our Children, which includes ‚ÄúMary Had a Little Lamb,‚Äù published in 1830.  But beyond being a prolific writer and a supporter of equal education for both genders, Hale was also a strong believer in the American nation and our Union. As an editor, she insisted on publishing American writers, rather than simply compiling articles from British periodicals as other American magazines did.  Her patriotism led her to put pen to paper and advocate for the creation of a national holiday that she believed would help unite an increasingly divided nation, a nation that was accelerating towards a bloody civil war. That national holiday was Thanksgiving.  Previous Presidents had issued proclamations to recognize the holiday, but at this point in history, Thanksgiving was not yet official nationwide. Instead, a governor in each state would declare the holiday by a special proclamation, and the date could vary each year because it was subject to the officeholder‚Äôs judgment. Most governors chose a Thursday in late November or early December, but some selected times as early as September or as late as January.  At the time, Thanksgiving wasn‚Äôt even celebrated in the South, where the holiday was almost completely unknown for the majority of the 19th century. And even when it did begin to spread, some southerners resisted the holiday, deeming it to be a Yankee tradition that was redundant and indulgent, particularly with Christmas just around the corner.  Starting in 1846, Hale began writing letters to the nation‚Äôs governors in support of the holiday. Her efforts did not go unnoticed. In fact, following on of her annual letters, Governor Thomas Drew of our own Arkansas declared the state‚Äôs first ever Thanksgiving Day in 1847. She also wrote letters to five Presidents: Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln.  Finally, in the midst of the Civil War, President Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be celebrated on the final Thursday of November.  A democracy simply cannot function without citizens like Sarah Hale, an informed and educated American fighting passionately for her beliefs and engaging officeholders. And I‚Äôm proud that, like Sarah Hale, the woman who contacted my office was already highly engaged, but she still wanted to know what else she could do.  To cede her point, sometimes it does seem like nothing ever changes, that true reform is too slow in coming. Every week something new goes wrong, and what was wrong before never seems completely fixed. But our founding fathers designed our process to be very slow and deliberate, resistant to change. How did Sarah Hale, and how do we ourselves, remain resilient in the face of such a daunting task and time frame?  Like the woman who wrote in, I was fed up with the way our country was headed when I ran for Congress, and I‚Äôm still fighting the same battles today that I was when I was first elected. To keep pushing for what is right, and to stand our ground against what may do this country harm, year after year, decade after decade, we need a source of strength.  For me, that source of strength is the same as it was almost 8 years ago. It comes from the people of the 1st District; people who I see every week when I come home from Washington; people like the woman who wrote my office to tell me her story. Hearing their stories, listening to their problems, seeing in person how families and businesses are affected by decisions made in Washington, I can‚Äôt help but find my resolve strengthened.  With each other as sources of strength, we do effect change, albeit slowly, and we can fight to change our nation‚Äôs course, all the while living out the love we have for our country and the respect we owe our countrymen.  Even with all of today‚Äôs problems, in the end we are blessed beyond what we as a nation could be thankful for or expect. This Thanksgiving, I‚Äôd like to give thanks for people like Sarah Hale and the woman who sent my office a letter, the ones who engage and actively work towards a better future. Those are the people who not only work everyday to make America the best country in the world, but also the ones who take the time to contact my office to lend their advice and expertise to the frustrating, vital, and wonderful struggle that is our nation‚Äôs governance.","status",NA,NA,60,23,10,6,0,0,0,0

Seventy-six years later, Joe Ann Taylor, a 1st District Arkansan, will accept the Bronze Star Medal on her father's behalf.","link","http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/dec/04/central-arkansas-woman-receive-navy-medal-fathers-/","arkansasonline.com",46,2,9,6,0,0,0,0

From poor job opportunities to drug addiction and poverty, we‚Äôve got our fair share of issues. But what I love about east Arkansas people is their dedication to each other and to their communities. My father grew up on a farm in the bootheel in Missouri and my granddad was born in Leachville, Ark.; they both would teach me that a good work ethic and respect for your neighbors and family comes first. Instead of allowing these challenges to define our communities, this week I‚Äôll be talking about some of those problems and what we can do, both at the federal and local level, to make east Arkansas an even better place to live and work.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRickCrawford/videos/1637423162982621/",NA,106,30,10,3,0,1,1,1

Rural America suffers far worse than urban areas because resources are scarcer, and many communities lack access to pain treatment alternatives, like physical therapy.   My bill, the Addiction Recovery Communities Act, prioritizes funding for projects to curb addiction and promote recovery in rural Arkansas. I hope that my message today will help raise awareness of this problem in our communities. Those suffering from addiction need to understand that they are worth more and that everyone is capable of recovery.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRickCrawford/videos/1639306809460923/",NA,54,26,11,6,0,0,2,0

As many of you know, I have been a strong advocate for opening up agricultural trade with Cuba.

These changes will create new jobs in our rural towns and bring opportunity back from abroad for our children and grandchildren, making east and north-central Arkansas communities even better places to live.

I have gotten to know Mayor Arnold over the last many years and have always enjoyed the time I spent with her.  She has been a lifelong servant of her community and has played a vital role not only in her family's business - E. Ritter &  Company - but that of the greater Northeast Arkansas region.  Mayor Arnold's life was built around service to others and supporting efforts that made the lives of others around her, better.  Her family has built on her legacy of service to others in so many ways, including her grandson, James, who has worked in my office the last four years.  I think we all can appreciate this quote from Mayor Arnold.  Please keep this family in your prayers as they mourn her passing.  ‚ÄúLife is to be lived to its fullest. We have a lot of responsibilities regardless of who we are in life and you can either live it to its fullest and be happy with your situation, or you can be miserable,‚Äù   Thank you for everything you did, Mayor Arnold.","link","http://www.kait8.com/story/37122969/marked-tree-mayor-mary-ann-arnold-passes-away","kait8.com",29,3,1,0,0,0,26,0
