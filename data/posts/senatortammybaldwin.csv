After President Trump was elected, he said he wanted to be a President ‚Äòfor all Americans,‚Äô but if this discriminatory order is signed, he would be breaking his word to the American people and authorizing taxpayer funded discrimination. This isn‚Äôt presidential leadership, this is an attack on our founding principles that all Americans are created equal under the law and that every American deserves the freedom to live their lives free from discrimination.   The Trump Administration was right to walk away from this executive order months ago. President Trump should do the right thing and work to move America forward, instead of being played as a puppet by Vice President Pence to advance an extreme right agenda that seeks to gives individuals and groups a license to discriminate against people because of who they are or who they love.    Just yesterday, I joined House and Senate colleagues in reintroducing the Equality Act, bipartisan legislation that would ensure all Americans are protected from discrimination. This legislation would make America a fairer and more equal place and is the right path forward for our country.   I believe that Americans are united in the belief that we have a shared responsibility to hand over to the next generation a country that is more equal, not less equal. The time has come in this country for full, federal equality, and nothing less.  All Americans should have an opportunity to achieve their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of America and we must fight to make sure we keep it by making our voices heard against this taxpayer funded discrimination.","status",NA,NA,356,54,65,10,2,4,26,43

This is why:  The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people‚Äôs health care away and they have sent a clear message that they want us to work across party lines to make things better, not worse.   As I have said throughout this debate, now is the time to work together to make things better by stabilizing the health insurance market, making health care more affordable, and taking on rising prescription drug costs.   I strongly believe that if both parties look past the partisan debate in Washington, we can find common ground on solutions that work for the American people.","status",NA,NA,1733,448,61,337,4,1,1,62

In 1981, American corporations spent $3.6 billion on buybacks. In 1982, the SEC gave corporate executives the green light on buybacks, telling them they would not be charged with stock price manipulation if they bought back their shares on the open market. By 1984, that number exploded to $37 billion, an increase of over 900 percent. Today, the numbers are astronomical: over the last five years S&P 500 companies alone spent over $2.5 trillion buy back their own stock.   The SEC needs to tighten its rules governing buybacks.
