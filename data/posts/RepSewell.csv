Hank is a life-long farmer who has been working on his family farm in Alabama for the majority of his 62 years. Back in 2015, his hands got stuck in a hay baler and he lost his right hand. Before the ACA, Hank's family hadn't had health coverage since the 1980s. His ACA policy ended up covering his entire hospital bill, which he says could have cost him his farm if he hadn't had insurance. Hank is just one of 213,000 Alabamians who have gained coverage under the ACA and millions more who have benefited.   As with any law, the ACA isn't perfect but rather than repealing the law, we need to work together to stabilize the market and increase access. Stories like Hank's remind us why our work to make health insurance affordable and accessible has never been more important. We do not want to go back to the day when millions of Americans were just one medical emergency away from financial ruin.   http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/slow_growth_higher_premiums_ex.html","link","http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/slow_growth_higher_premiums_ex.html","al.com",310,19,222,24,0,9,4,0

I want all Medicaid recipients and providers in my district and across Alabama to know how very seriously I take my responsibility to protect this program.  Today I want to introduce you to Dr. Martha Raulerson, an Alabama pediatrician. She knows how critical Medicaid is to Alabama's children, families, and overall economy. After serving as a school teacher for a decade, she enrolled in medical school at the age of 33 and later moved to Alabama to serve the children of rural south Alabama. She is committed to caring for the whole child by not only addressing their health needs but also giving them each a book to take home after each visit. She is truly inspiring.   We cannot play games with Medicaid. The cost is too high. As Dr. Raulerson has said, “Our children have only one childhood. We have only one chance to get it right.”   The Anniston Star named her the 2016 Alabamian of the Year so you can read more about her here: http://bit.ly/2iJIJMp  Also, check her out on twitter, where you can learn more about her patients. https://twitter.com/MarshaDRaulerso","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSewell/photos/a.128219443917767.24805.117758198297225/1355956911144008/?type=3",NA,85,0,33,11,0,0,0,0

A vote in the House on this same measure is expected this week which I will proudly oppose on behalf of the 213,000 Alabamians who have gained coverage under the Act. Republicans have had 7 years to produce a viable alternative to the ACA and have failed to do so. Instead of abruptly repealing the law without a replacement, we need to work together to increase access, stabilize the markets, and decrease costs.

He heard on the radio that there are plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. He called my office immediately to find out if it was true. We were sad to tell him that yes, the Senate approved a measure last night to move forward with repeal that the House is scheduled to vote on tomorrow.   I also got a call from a mother in Birmingham today who has a  full-time job at the hospital. She was in tears. Her young son has cystic fibrosis, which is a preexisting condition. Her mother has thyroid issues. Both are at risk of losing the protections they've gained through the ACA. If the ACA is repealed and a viable replacement isn't immediately enacted, my constituent will have to leave her job to care for her uninsured mother and son.    I wish these stories weren't true.   The myth that recipients of the ACA and other government programs don't work as hard as the wealthy is tired. My congressional district is full of people who, like my constituents who have called today, work full-time jobs and rely on programs like the ACA for their health insurance.   We must stand up for these hard-working families.","status",NA,NA,517,64,303,16,0,3,111,77

The victims of his unjust prosecution were not only the former Governor and his family but the millions of Alabamians who stood to benefit from his initiatives, including his work to increase education funding, recruit industry to the state, and reform the state’s regressive tax structure. I want to welcome Governor Siegleman back home. I pray God's blessings on him and his family. While I am disappointed that our efforts did not lead to a presidential pardon, I believe that the faith and heart of the man have not been deterred by his unjust prosecution and imprisonment and I know that his passion and commitment to public service is still needed in our state.","status",NA,NA,145,12,8,20,0,0,1,1

Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the decline in manufacturing jobs in America on trade and immigration. In reality, these jobs have fallen victim to the persistent pace of automation, not globalization. Even worse than not being honest about our collective responsibility to train our citizenry for the jobs of today, he chose a Labor Secretary nominee who has bragged about replacing human workers with kiosks.   Here is what Puzder had to say about using robots over human workers: ""They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case...Millennials like not seeing people. I've been inside restaurants where we've installed ordering kiosks...and I've actually seen young people waiting in line to use the kiosk where there's a person standing behind the counter, waiting on nobody.""  I hope the President will now choose a Labor Secretary who values the American worker and knows we need to equip our citizens with skills to #MakeItInAmerica, not politically convenient scapegoats!!   On behalf of workers in my district, I thank the Senators who stood firm for American workers today.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSewell/photos/a.128219443917767.24805.117758198297225/1407927405946958/?type=3",NA,102,8,10,4,0,0,0,0

When we value people who think differently, who see things differently, and who do things differently, then we address our challenges with a creativity and thoughtfulness we wouldn't otherwise have.

Many of our Wilcox County constituents have written in to tell me how important J Paul Jones Hospital has been to them and their families over the years.   One constituent sent me the following on Friday night:    ""Dr. Paul's clinic had treated our flu, sprained ankles, and measles.  But only the hospital could cope with the stabbing victims Dr. Paul saw too often. Two of my classmates had hepatitis one year and were kept comfortable and isolated at the new hospital.  Black and white, old and young, rich or poor, brave or scared, all could be patched up and sent home to live to tell about their scars, usually.  Some did not recover.  But all received the same quality level of care. Future generations should have MORE, not less. Please save the little hospital that could!""

Little did I know, how important our hospital truly is. I had never been put in the situation to where our hospital was NEEDED so badly. My 4 year old daughter was recently bit by a snake. At the time, we actually did not know that was what had bit her. Being that we didn't know, & judging by how fast her swelling had begun & discoloration we did NOT hesitate to rush her to our local hospital. Upon arrival the staff did not waste a minute to get her into the back & try to figure out what was going on. When the doctor came in, he didn't frighten us, but let us know quickly that he was going to call for lifeflight immediately. They began some blood work & got her as comfortable as possible until the air lift arrived. My daughter was sent to Children's & it was ruled as a copperhead bite. Had we the only option to drive 45 minutes or more to the next nearest facility, things could have (been) much worse. We NEED our facility to remain open. The nearest facility to us is nearly an hour away, in any direction from Camden. Please, we need our hospital.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSewell/photos/a.128219443917767.24805.117758198297225/1648984378507925/?type=3",NA,31,4,6,2,0,1,6,0

Today would be her 100th birthday.  She was born the youngest of 20 children  in Mississippi. Her family worked as sharecroppers, and at the age of six, Fannie Lou joined them in the fields. It was in 1962, after nearly forty years of sharecropping that Fannie Lou Hamer tried to register to vote. For African Americans in Mississippi during the Jim Crowe era, that was an act of extraordinary courage. Fannie Lou knew these dangers, but nevertheless, she persisted.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSewell/videos/1705255526214143/",NA,250,40,128,69,1,1,12,2

This is unconscionable.  GOP leaders are refusing to reauthorize CHIP without cutting funds for other health programs. That is nonsense. I just watched them vote for a wealthy tax cut that raises the national debt by $1.5 trillion.  I've been calling  for an extension of CHIP for months. But even after it expired, the Ways and Means Committee refused to hold a hearing. Instead, they spent time writing a tax bill for the wealthy. We need to reauthorize CHIP now. Not by slashing other healthcare programs, not at the end of the week, and not next month. This isn't about politics, it's about children's access to healthcare.
