This Teacher Appreciation Week we praise the teachers in the trenches now, and the ones that blazed a trail before them, like L. Claudia Allen.  Allen was a pioneer in her field. She started teaching after WWI and spent 48-years at Orange County Public Schools.  She fought for equal opportunity in education and was a constant advocate for social justice. Her legacy lives on in Orlando.   Our community is a better place because of her.

Meet Shai'Robia Davis, a Florida native, who is shadowing me today. As a former Foster Care Counselor, I am proud to have her shadow me.   Resilient, smart, and determined, she entered foster care at 3-months old, and bounced around from home-to-home before aging out of the system at 18.   She is now studying Microbiology, and in her free time volunteers to help foster care youth. She attributes community support to her story being one of ""success"".  But many who age out of the foster care system are at a higher risk for poor educational outcomes, health issues, and homelessness. We must work to reverse these trends by creating permanent homes for young people in foster care faster. #FosterYouthVoices","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepresentativeValDemings/photos/a.1288813107867564.1073741828.1285322494883292/1424518140963726/?type=3",NA,45,1,4,5,0,1,0,0

The past year has felt as if I am living on a roller coaster that never ends. Life has been filled with many great highs, but are always accompanied by extreme lows. Through my lowest moments of last year, my support system and their positivity are what have brought me out of those dark spaces. That positivity enveloped me and has driven me to get involved in politics to, in some way, make a difference in the world, and bring love and inclusion to individuals and communities who feel excluded.  I am honored to intern with a Member of Congress who shares similar views and ideals of that of my own. It is an uplifting and enriching experience to work for an individual I can connect with and relate to, who is working for the benefit of her constituents.
