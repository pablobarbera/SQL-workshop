She visited recently to ask me to co-sponsor a bill called The Lymphedema Treatment Act, which I proudly did. This bill would help kids like Emma and others get insurance coverage for special, doctor-prescribed compression garments that help people with lymphedema manage their condition. She‚Äôs growing really quickly (like any 9-year-old should) and her insurance company is dragging their feet supplying new garments. The LTA would fix that‚Äîhere‚Äôs what she sent my healthcare staffer, Morgan: ‚ÄúHi Ms. Morgan! Do you remember me? it‚Äôs Emma (purple cape) and I met you in March with The Lymphedema Treatment Act meeting. I‚Äôm 9 now so mom is making me type my own email-im not that good. But this is very important. Do you know how much it means to me that Senator Schumer cosigned the LTA? It means everything!!! He has so many important things to do and since he cosigned it means he really cares. I bet you do too because you probably do a lot of his work. I think it‚Äôs important that I tell you both the biggest THANK YOU in the world. Right now my garments are too tight because since I‚Äôm 9 I grew a lot. Im waiting on insurance for my new ones because they‚Äôre not used to me growing so fast and they don‚Äôt want to pay for them. The LTA is going to help me stay healthy so I can just be a regular kid. So thank you 100 million times for cosigning and I hope you have a great day!

The President's extended signing statement, however, demonstrates that Congress is going to need to keep a sharp eye on this Administration‚Äôs implementation of this critical law and any actions it takes with respect to Ukraine.   Democrats and Republicans worked well together to ensure that this bill arrived at the President‚Äôs desk with a veto-proof majority.

If the President pursues this path, against the wishes of both Republicans and Democrats, as well as the majority of the American people, he will be heading towards a government shutdown which nobody will like and which won‚Äôt accomplish anything. In April, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a strong, bipartisan appropriations bill that increased funding for our troops, scientific research, border security, and more. Putting aside the fact that Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall,  there‚Äôs even bipartisan agreement that a border wall doesn‚Äôt equal real border security; we need smart technology, drones, and modernized facilities to secure the border.   Working together, Republicans and Democrats in Congress can do our job and fund the government for FY2018. I‚Äôm sure the House and Senate will rise above the President‚Äôs threats of a government shutdown and send a bipartisan appropriations bill to his desk without a wall. The real answer isn‚Äôt a wall, it‚Äôs passing bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.

These are U.S. citizens that need help.   -First, Puerto Rico needs additional security presence of at least 1000-1500 people. They need US military disaster and humanitarian assistance to help maintain order and man food and fuel.  -Second, they need additional first responders, and all available resources to help restore communications on the island. -Third, they need at least 200 generators, additional fuel, and fuel trucks. -Fourth, they need hundreds of power workers to get the power back up and running.  -Lastly, FEMA and the Coast Guard need to get the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which is now also an airport completely back up and running, to help get supplies and personnel to the island.
