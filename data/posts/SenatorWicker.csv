Barfoot, a Medal of Honor recipient and World War II, Korea, and Vietnam veteran. Barfoot was born June 15, 1919, in Edinburg, Miss. and enlisted in the Army in 1940, serving through 1974. Barfoot died in 2012 at the age of 92. #MississippiMonday --- The Washington Post obituary for Colonel Barfoot described his ‚Äúherculean efforts‚Äù on the day he earned his Medal of Honor:  On May 23, 1944, Col. Barfoot was ordered to lead an assault on German positions. He went out alone and crawled to within feet of a German bunker.  According to his Medal of Honor citation, he tossed a grenade inside, killing two Germans and wounding three others. He then moved to another bunker nearby and killed two more German soldiers with his submachine gun while taking three others prisoner. A third machine gun crew, watching Col. Barfoot‚Äôs methodical assault, surrendered to him. In all, 17 Germans gave themselves up to Col. Barfoot.  In retaliation, the Germans organized a counterattack on Col. Barfoot‚Äôs position, sending three tanks toward him.  Col. Barfoot grabbed a bazooka grenade launcher and stood 75 yards in front of the leading tank. His first shot stopped it in its tracks. He then killed three of the German tank crew members who had attempted to escape.  The other two tanks, witnessing the destruction, abruptly changed directions, moving away from Col. Barfoot. Returning to his platoon, he helped carry two wounded U.S. soldiers almost a mile to safety.  Col. Barfoot served in the Korean War and later in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot. His other military decorations included the Silver Star; two awards of the Legion of Merit; the Bronze Star; three awards of the Purple Heart; and 11 awards of the Air Medal.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorWicker/photos/a.576363949086144.1073741827.158401580882385/1386848328037698/?type=3",NA,170,39,16,8,0,9,0,0
