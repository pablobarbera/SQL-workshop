I‚Äôm 90 years old ‚Äî live alone and all my friends have passed away. I am so lonesome and scared. Please ‚Äî I pray for some one.‚Äù   That‚Äôs exactly the situation Marleen Brooks of Park Hills found herself in‚Äîbut luckily for her elderly neighbor Wanda, she knew just what to do. Armed with cupcakes, Marleen and a friend walked across the street to Wanda‚Äôs house, and started a brand new friendship. After reading about Marleen and Wanda‚Äôs story, Claire‚Äîwho for years led the Senate Aging Committee alongside Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine‚Äîwas determined to reach out to them, and posted this video to Facebook: www.facebook.com/senatormccaskill/videos/10156266510862619/?permPage=1   ‚ÄúI think the lesson here is everybody needs a friend, and we need to get outside of our comfort zones and reach out to people who may feel like strangers, even if they live just down the street. Especially the elderly. Especially reaching out to people who are home alone and older, and who don‚Äôt have a support system. I would love to meet Marleen and Wanda. The news coverage of this just says they‚Äôre in Missouri, so if anybody knows where Marleen and Wanda live, and can get in touch with my office, I‚Äôd like to come over and talk to Marleen and Wanda. I‚Äôd love to hear about Wanda‚Äôs life, I‚Äôd love to find out more about her, so‚Ä¶ love a stranger, and Marleen and Wanda‚Äîreach out so I can come say hello.‚Äù   Thanks to the kindness of strangers, we were able to track down Marleen and Wanda and Claire finally had a chance to meet them both earlier this month. ‚ÄúWanda just reminds me so much of my mom. Straight-talker and full of vinegar,‚Äù Claire said, after meeting the two women in Park Hills. ‚ÄúShe told me I look much better in real life than on the TV, and that getting older is overrated.‚Äù   Ì†ΩÌ≥∑ SEE PHOTOS FROM CLAIRE‚ÄôS VISIT WITH MARLEEN AND WANDA: https://flic.kr/s/aHsm3eTeX4   After meeting Wanda, and realizing how many seniors in America face the same isolation and sadness, Marleen was determined to make a difference, and organized a Pen Pals For Seniors program online. In a little over a month, Marleen had already received ~6,000 responses, and so far, 500 letters have been exchanged between volunteers and seniors around the world. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people are going to always say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm lonely,‚Äô ‚Äù said one volunteer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be revealed, due to people‚Äôs pride and stuff, but I think it‚Äôs more widespread than you would ever know.‚Äù   Marleen and Wanda: We are so proud of both of you for your bravery in reaching out to a stranger, and your ingenuity for turning something sad into something wonderful.

Mildred was a force to be reckoned with, working herself to the bone to provide for her family as a single mother in Missouri. She spent decades working as a secretary in the state unemployment office from 8‚Äî5 every day, and at night would help prepare lunches for the next day at her sister and brother-in-law‚Äôs corner drug store in Lebanon. She spent her Saturdays baking loaves of bread for sick members of her church‚Äôs congregation, and her Sundays at church where she was the organist.   Like most hard-working Missourians, Mildred instilled her work ethic into her daughter, who later inspired it in her daughter‚Ä¶ who eventually became the first woman elected to the Senate from the State of Missouri!
