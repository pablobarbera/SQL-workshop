Six years later it has resulted in 1,781,000 Texans gaining health coverage and the uninsured rate in Texas has fallen by 28 percent. The Republicans plan to repeal the ACA will cause tens of millions of people to lose their health coverage and millions of Americans will be paying more for their insurance.    I will continue to work to ensure that the ACA stays in place, despite the uproar and support Republicans have put forth to dismantle it. I will push for Texas to expand Medicaid so that more Texans can receive the same benefits that millions of Americans in Medicaid expansion states currently receive. During the 115th Congress, I will make it my goal to improve the law so that we can fulfill the generations-long struggle to make health care a right, not a privilege, for all Americans.  Share how you and your family have benefited from the #ACA in the comments below, so we can remind Republicans what is at stake. #ACAWorks #CoverageMatters","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanEBJtx30/photos/a.96602647067.86524.84096022067/10154848522012068/?type=3",NA,56,9,6,7,0,0,0,0

They intend to follow through on their threats to ram through a budget bill that will severely undermine the health care needs of the American people. Yet, over the past six years, Americans have not only gained reliable coverage, they have also seen an end to lifetime limits, received free preventive care, have been allowed to keep their health coverage on their parent’s plan until the age of 26, and are no longer discriminated against for pre-existing conditions.

Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, protesters were met with a blockade of state troopers and local law enforcement. Refusing to return to Selma, protesters were subjected to tear gas and injuries sustained from billy club attacks.

As policymakers, we have the unique opportunity to work alongside both women and men leaders to help them access the necessary resources to effectively implement peace strategies in their communities.   This year’s conference will address the region’s conflict and ways to promote peace. The Israel-Palestine region presents arguably the world’s most controversial and complex conflict. Beginning in the mid-20th century, the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians generates a wide array of views. The A World of Women for World Peace initiative is based upon the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda developed by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General at the Hague Convention as a result of the UN Security Council’s Resolution 1325 in 2000.
