The news for our state was much worse. Oklahoma will see a rise of 76 percent with only one health insurer to offer plans through the federal exchange in 2017. This will leave Oklahomans with no choice for their healthcare and devastatingly increased costs.   Today’s vote begins the legislative process to repeal Obamacare and implement a plan that is focused on putting control back into the hands of patients, families, and doctors.

The executive action issued Friday is a 90-day pause and reevaluation of the screening process for individuals traveling from seven war-torn nations, and a 120-day pause for the refugee resettlement program. It is not a ban on Muslims or a permanent change in immigration policy. However, this executive action has some unintended consequences that were not well thought out. I encourage the president's staff to evaluate American policy with an eye on both security and compassion for the refugees fleeing the terrors of war and persecution. For decades, our resettlement program has maintained a very extensive multi-year screening process for refugees from all over the world. There are unique challenges when you accept refugees from countries like Syria and Yemen, but our American security and intelligence communities are the best in the world. America can have strong homeland security and uphold our foundational values of religious freedom and refuge for the persecuted. These goals are not mutually exclusive. We should also encourage, not discourage, people who have gone through the legal visa and immigration process. America has always welcomed people from different walks of life, religions and countries, and we should continue doing so.","status",NA,NA,1775,445,433,146,0,3,5,98

There are often lengthy debates, rescheduled votes, and amendment negotiations outside the media spotlight that the general public does not see. I want the best possible health care reform bill to pass the House, so that when we take it up in the Senate, it only needs minimal corrections.   Despite the actions of today, Congress must still pursue the repeal and replacement of Obamacare to provide a smooth transition to a better health care system and better coverage options for everyone. Oklahoma is currently experiencing a one-year 76 percent individual insurance increase with only one insurer left through the federal exchange, on top of a 35 percent increase from last year.   For something as important as health care, we must take the necessary time and get this right. Congress should help improve the health care system in a way that does no harm to current enrollees.","status",NA,NA,523,484,73,7,37,2,5,50

I could not support that and I did not.   There are two options to fund our government right now: pass a Continuing Resolution that continues to fund the government at the spending level of the last omnibus, or support the new omnibus, which funds the government for the rest of the year with much needed reforms to reduce spending, reductions in unnecessary regulations, and more transparency. Neither option is ideal, but there is no question that the latest appropriations bill is better than last year.  As I support this path to fund the government until September 2017, I strongly urge Congress to reform the current budget process and produce a balanced budget. Since 1974, the budget process has worked as intended only four times; in fact, Congress has passed a continuing resolution 173 times. This is not a political issue, it’s a process issue, and Congress needs to fix the broken process. We must continue to work to reform the budget process to address the most predictable crisis in our history, rather than putting off this crisis until later.

It's not an unreasonable request to be able to say pray for them. Ask God to continue to protect them.

Article VI of the US Constitution clearly states: ‘no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.’   We cannot say we have the free exercise of religion and also require people to practice their faith only in a way that government officials prefer. Many faith traditions have complex and exclusive theological beliefs, and whether we agree with them or not, those diverse beliefs are protected by the Constitution.   The freedom to be Christian, Yezidi, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, or another religion, or practice no religion, is an American right, and the United States Senate must not waver in our protection of that diversity and freedom.

The Democrats are stalling simple, non-controversial appointments to important positions at agencies like the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. Of the 197 Presidential nominations to agencies, the Senate has only confirmed 48, and only 2 of 23 judicial nominations have been confirmed. To put this into perspective, this Senate has only confirmed 23% of this administration’s nominations, while at this time in President Obama’s first term, the Senate had confirmed 69% of nominations. The historic obstruction by Senate Democrats not only puts national security at risk and delays the real work we were sent to Washington to do, it undermines the will of the American people.

And yet, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer abused Senate procedural rules to stall his nomination for three days.   David Nye was nominated for this position back in May. Traditionally, if there is widespread support for a nominee like this, the Senate votes on the person several weeks after nomination. The Senate can’t consider multiple nominations at the same time—we must consider them one at a time, so Senator Schumer is slow-walking all of the nominees one at a time… even when there is unanimous support for the candidate.

An amendment by Senator Dean Heller regarding Medicaid expansion that failed by a vote of 10-90. There was also an amendment that would repeal Obamacare with a two-year delay for consideration of a replacement, which I voted for. This is similar to the 2015 bill that President Obama vetoed. Today, that vote failed by a vote of 45-55.  The American people and the people of Oklahoma voted in November for change in Washington, and a big part of that change included the repeal of Obamacare. So, it is important for Republicans to try to follow through on that promise.   I have heard some in the media say this bill and the BCRA would ""take healthcare away from millions of people"" and they will die. These statements are not accurate, nor helpful to a substantive debate about healthcare. The facts of the matter is that these bills would repeal the Obamacare individual mandate which forces people to buy insurance. With the repeal of that mandate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that millions of Americans will ""choose"" not to buy insurance, not ""lose"" the insurance plans they have. And for me, I don't think the federal government should compel a person to purchase something.   Tomorrow night, there will be more series of amendments offered by both Republicans and Democrats.

This afternoon the Senate voted on an amendment that would create a government run ‘single-payer’ healthcare system, like the one Bernie Sanders has advocated for. The legislative text of the amendment was the exact same as the “Medicare for All” bill (HR 676) already introduced in the House. It’s called ‘single payer’ because it would create one payer, or insurer - the federal government.   I opposed this amendment because I think it would not just double-down, but triple-down on many of the problems of Obamacare. Nearly every health-care decision could be decided by a federal bureaucrat in Washington, DC. Yes, there are many countries around the world that have similar healthcare models, like the United Kingdom, France, and Canada… but it is nearly indisputable that the American medical industry is still one of the most respected and advanced in the world, so much so that many people come to the U.S. from around the world for the best healthcare. And oh, by the way, a single payer system would require the government to significantly increase income taxes to pay for it.   Thankfully, this amendment failed by a bipartisan vote of 0-57, with 43 senators responding “present.” That’s right. 43 Senators were there, but refused to take a position on a bill that has over 150 Democrat co-sponsors in the House of Representatives.

I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate was unable to get the job done and improve healthcare for millions of people. Healthcare insurance premiums have increased 76 percent on average for Oklahoma residents on the federal exchange this year. For years, I and my staff have worked to develop solutions to our national healthcare crisis. After months of work and debate, we were one vote short.   Today, some media pundits have focused on who won and who lost over the healthcare vote. This reaction is so frustrating to me. This debate is not about what politician won and who lost or what political party won and which party lost, this healthcare conversation is about people's lives.   First, we must realize that many Americans have been helped by Obamacare, but also admit that many Americans have been hurt by the law. This issue is complicated and is not as easy as some make it seem. Second, the missing part of today's reaction has been the families that can no longer afford health insurance because their rates have increased over 200%, both in states that expanded Medicaid and states that did not... The doctors who have taken early retirement rather than live their lives filling out new forms and taking lower reimbursement rates... The more than 6 million people who pay a healthcare tax penalty because they cannot afford coverage, or simply don't want to be forced by the government to purchase something… The hundreds of counties in America where there is one or no insurance carrier left.   None of those realities changed last night, and none of those things occurred because of a Republican plan—they were already spiraling out-of-control because of the Affordable Care Act. For every good thing that Obamacare did for those in poverty, it also created some adverse consequences for other Americans. In D.C., healthcare became a hyper partisan fight, instead of a mission to work together to get healthcare for people at rates they can afford. The losers in the failed vote last night were not politicians in Washington DC, they were people sitting at kitchen tables across America trying to make sense of the chaos of their finances and their government.","status",NA,NA,1065,1199,330,41,52,9,199,291

Two options were provided to address disaster relief for Hurricane Harvey: one stand-alone bill, which I fully supported and a second option that included Hurricane Harvey relief, a debt ceiling increase, and short-term funding until December 8, which I did not support.   Disaster relief and the debt ceiling should have been completely separate. It has become abundantly clear that Washington no longer sees the debt limit as a chance to actually tackle our runaway debt problems. Rather, it is used as a political football to move through the pending business of the day, instead of an opportunity to offer responsible, forward-thinking plans to save future generations from today’s out-of-control spending decisions.   The debt limit debate should force Congress to address our growing debt. In Fiscal Year 2016 alone, we had a $587 billion deficit and our federal debt is now an outrageous $19.8 trillion. Whenever Congress debates the debt ceiling, we must enact spending reforms or a plan to address our deficit. Months ago, I laid out a reasonable plan for the debt ceiling that would direct our focus toward addressing the debt and providing predictability to the markets. In another three months, we will debate the debt ceiling again; hopefully, we will consider serious reforms and debt reductions at that time.","status",NA,NA,535,359,106,13,5,8,35,71

Jimmy Kimmel discussed it on his late-night show last night, so I wanted to clear some things up.   HERE ARE THE FACTS: Created in 1997, CHIP is a healthcare federal block grant program to the states to provide health insurance for low-income children who don’t qualify for Medicaid. This CHIP block grant is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and must be matched with state dollars. In Oklahoma, approximately 180,000 children benefit from this block grant program. On October 1, 2017, the federal funding authorization for the program expired, however, there is enough money in the program to fund it until March 2018 for most states, including Oklahoma.    I want to be clear: I fully support the CHIP program. Unfortunately, there are some serious management inefficiencies, fraud, and waste within the CHIP program that need to be addressed. I am eager to see some fiscally responsible and sustainable reforms made to the program so that it’s strengthened for the families who rely on it and the funding for the program can go undisturbed for years to come. Children and families are counting on us to put in safeguards now so that cuts are not necessary in the future. Although the funding for this program lasts until next Spring, I want a solution sooner rather than later. I don’t sit on the committee working on CHIP reforms (Senate Finance Committee), but I am working with my colleagues to ensure that children continue to get the support they need, and I will keep you updated in the days ahead.","status",NA,NA,641,558,174,38,9,6,10,144

Today, the Federal Communications Commission, not Congress, voted on a plan to roll back regulations that create more government control of the internet. The regulations were put in place in 2015 under the President Obama administration to have greater control on internet provider management and access, but they ended up hurting broadband investment and innovation. Since 2015, the extra regulations have resulted in less broadband investment in rural areas of Oklahoma, which is a big problem for many rural states.    Look, there is often an appropriate need for regulations, but I have always preferred less federal regulation, not more. Internet providers will still have strong consumer protections and transparency requirements to maintain. The exaggerated doomsday scenarios about net neutrality have been over-the-top. Before these 2015 regulations, the internet thrived under both Democratic and Republican administrations. America is a world leader in internet technology—a position we can and should maintain in the future. Moving forward, we must be cautious about issuing preemptive regulations and examine the market need for such rules. And the American people, through Congress, should make these types of decisions, not a federal bureaucracy.","status",NA,NA,1140,1634,448,87,29,11,12,890
