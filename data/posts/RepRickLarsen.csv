Stan was a Northwest TV icon as a host of a local kid’s show in the earlier days of Seattle TV and as a throwback to the area’s Scandinavian settler roots. Stan produced several albums full of pretty corny accordion music sung with that thickly exaggerated Norwegian accent that made “Walking in My Winter Underwear,” into “Valking in My Vinter Undervear,”  all in mocking good fun of the local Scandinavian culture, much like today’s Ylvis songs make fun of today’s Norway.  He was a master of the Ole and Lena jokes with a few about Sven thrown in, the kind of jokes you can only hear today on The Prairie Home Companion during its annual Joke Show.  I met Stan a few times and have an autographed copy of one of his Christmas albums, the one with “Aunt Lena Got Run Over By A Reindeer,” “Here Comes Ingebrit,” and the aforementioned, “Valking in My Vinter Undervear.” His good humor and good nature are in short supply today. It is okay to take a break for a few seconds to mourn his passing and to laugh with your friends at his terrible, funny jokes. I will miss Stanley Boreson.","link","http://www.heraldnet.com/news/stan-boreson-king-of-scandinavian-humor-dies-at-91/","heraldnet.com",255,64,51,44,0,1,145,0

Rick Larsen (D-2nd District) pitched in on Wednesday to help deliver meals to Edmonds and Mountlake Terrace seniors as a part of the Senior Services of Snohomish County Meals on Wheels program – an initiative that would be partially cut under President Trump’s proposed budget.  One of those on the route was Margaret Johnson of Edmonds, who depends on Meals on Wheels for her daily main meal. Since suffering a stroke that caused her to lose much of the use of her left arm, Johnson finds it hard to prepare food. ‘Meals on Wheels is great. The food is all prepared and all I have to do is heat it up,’ she said with a smile.”","link","http://lynnwoodtoday.com/larsen-volunteers-meals-wheels-meets-local-seniors-threatened-budget-cuts/","lynnwoodtoday.com",88,7,3,6,0,1,0,0

Their powerful stories show what’s at stake for Washington families if the Affordable Care Act is replaced by Trumpcare.  “Sammy was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe hemophilia A, which means he lacks a clotting protein in his blood. Untreated, Sammy is susceptible to dangerous cuts and bruises but also would suffer from bleeding in his joints that causes extreme pain.  Sammy’s treatment includes an injected medication that costs a dollar a unit, his mother said; but Sammy currently requires 550 units a day. At 2, Sammy already has received more than a half-million dollars in medical treatment.  Colton Matter, 16, plays varsity golf for Jackson High School in Mill Creek and will be a senior next fall. Since the age of 9, Colton has had to fight off acute lymphoblastic leukemia, beating it into remission five times with bone-marrow transplants and trial medications, only to see it return four times, said his mother, Suzy Matter.  Colton’s story — and that of Colton’s Army, ‘prayer warriors’ who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for leukemia research in his name — was told in 2014 by The Herald’s Amy Nile.  Both mothers now are concerned about the loss of the Affordable Care Act and what might replace it, especially if protections for patients with pre-existing conditions are removed or weakened or if insurance companies again are allowed to put lifetime limits on coverage.”","link","http://bit.ly/2rDgBwW","bit.ly",57,21,24,0,0,4,36,5

This will likely result in a sicker, older health care pool remaining on the exchanges and force insurers to drive up marketplace premiums.  Second: Last night, Trump decided to stop paying the federal cost-sharing reduction subsidies that enrollees rely on to keep premiums low. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, ending the subsidies will increase average premiums by 20 percent next year. These combined actions will ultimately drive up the cost of your health care. What does all this mean?   It means the President of the United States, backed by Congressional Republicans, has taken a nightmarishly cynical & dangerous approach on health care: Sabotage the American health care system, for no other reason than to score political points on behalf of a 7 year disinformation campaign waged against the Affordable Care Act.  These were the President’s decisions, but the ball is now in Congress’ court. It is time to get behind the bipartisan ACA marketplace stabilization plan being worked on by Senators Murray & Alexander to lower premiums, improve quality and expand access to health care.","status",NA,NA,90,91,77,4,5,1,35,163

Rick Larsen (WA-02) hosted a roundtable discussion with representatives from Providence Health Services, Community Health Network of Washington, Seattle Children’s Hospital, and Community Health Centers of Snohomish County about the importance of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).   CHIP, which expired on September 30th after Congress failed to reauthorize the program, funds comprehensive, affordable health coverage for over 65,000 Washington children each year. Without action from Congress soon, Washington state will begin notifying all enrolled families who are at risk of losing health coverage for their children on December 1st. Larsen, who is a strong supporter of CHIP, is working to urge Congressional leadership to bring a clean CHIP reauthorization bill to the House floor.  Afterward, Larsen met with Everett Transit officials about how electric busses will impact the agency’s operations. Last year, Larsen announced that the City of Everett had been awarded a $3.4 million competitive grant to help reduce carbon emissions in the city’s busses. The grant was made possible by the Low or No Emissions Bus Program grant which was authorized by the five-year transportation bill Larsen helped pass in 2015.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRickLarsen/photos/a.1490286727673861.1073741896.135654683137079/1490286737673860/?type=3",NA,36,10,1,0,0,0,0,1

And while Congress takes a break for two weeks, I would like to remind folks that:   1.) There are still 800,000 Dreamers – young people who were raised in this country and have contributed to our economy and communities–in jeopardy of losing their legal status.   2.) 9 million children are threatened with the loss of health insurance because the CHIP program has not been fully reauthorized.  3.) It has been more than two months since funding for Community Health Centers has lapsed – leaving 27 million Americans who rely on these centers with limited access to care.   If Congress does not act soon – millions of Americans in the Pacific Northwest and nationwide will suffer the consequences.","status",NA,NA,72,73,23,0,5,3,37,51
