Trump about a number of conservative reforms to improve the proposed House Republican health care bill.   I was particularly pleased that our discussion led to the president’s support for creating optional Medicaid block grants; incentivizing the implementation of work requirements for able-bodied, non-disabled, childless adults; and preventing tax credits from being used to pay for elective abortions. These are strong, conservative wins that will substantially improve the bill.  The president asked for my help in pushing these key reforms through, and I stand ready and willing to do just that. I see today's meeting as evidence that the system is working: Members of Congress and the president sitting around a table, having a serious conversation about how to improve legislation that will help the people we were elected to serve.","link","https://ratcliffe.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-ratcliffe-meeting-president-trump-discuss-repealing-and-replacing","ratcliffe.house.gov",105,43,8,9,0,0,0,14

This could be an email that was sent, an online purchase, or geolocation technology that places an individual at the scene of a crime.  Cyber elements add layers of complexity to the crimes our local law enforcement officers face every day – and we’ve got to make sure they have access to the training they need to address this trend.

This is the toughest legislation we've passed yet to deliver much-needed reforms to our VA and help ensure proper care for veterans.   When implemented, it will expedite the ability to remove, demote or suspend VA employees for poor performance or misconduct that can place our veterans’ access to care in jeopardy, while also expanding protections for whistleblowers who seek to stop such abuse.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has more than 400 Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) personnel working to save lives in south Texas. Another 500-plus personnel are in the state and are expected to be performing rescues this evening.  National US&R teams, located across the United States, are trained and equipped to handle structural collapses and swift water rescues.  State and local officials are asking those in the impacted area to please remember:  Stay calm, do not panic.  Do not go into your attic – rescuers from the air cannot see you. Safely seek higher ground if able to do so; get to a safe place. Safely mark your roof to be seen by the air. To get rescuers’ attention, wave sheets, towels etc.  If you feel your life is in danger, call 911. First responders are not responding to requests for assistance received through social media, so if you cannot get through to 911 at first, keep calling.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has also stated that if you are in need of immediate rescue you can call them at the following numbers:  281-464-4851 281-464-4852 281-464-4853 281-464-4854 281-464-4855  The Coast Guard has over 420 personnel conducting operations in south Texas, with 16 helicopters in the air and 8 more inbound. As of 3 p.m. EDT today, the Coast Guard has confirmed rescues of more than 2,000 multi-person cases in the Houston-Galveston area.  The Coast Guard also has an additional nine teams onsite doing shallow water rescues. More information on USCG rescue operations is available on their website at: http://www.news.uscg.mil/Texas/.
