Last week, I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to cosponsor a bill recognizing April as Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  Bringing attention and awareness to this issue is a critical first step to stop these heinous crimes.  Sadly, men and women serving in our armed forces experience unacceptably high rates of sexual assault. These service members also face cyber-harassment and the distribution of intimate photos and videos on social media, as evidenced by the recent ‚ÄúMarine United‚Äù scandal.  To deter such unacceptable behavior that damages our military‚Äôs morale, I cosponsored the PRIVATE Act. Offered by Air Force veteran and Arizona Representative Martha McSally, this legislation would criminalize this disgraceful behavior under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This important reform would give military prosecutors the necessary tools to take legal action against those who carry out this reprehensible behavior.

They deserve the highest quality health care possible through the VA, no questions asked.  Three years ago this week we learned that a wait time manipulation scandal resulted in dozens of veterans dying while awaiting treatment at a Phoenix VA hospital.  Unfortunately, pervasive problems continue to plague the VA system, threatening the lives of millions of veterans who rely on the VA for medical care.  Just this week, an alarming report revealed that conditions within the Washington, DC VA Medical Center are so dire that hospital patients are actually in danger.  This conduct is inexcusable, and I will continue to push for meaningful reforms to the VA.  The House of Representatives has taken important steps to address the VA‚Äôs systemic problems and ensure our veterans receive timely and quality care.   We recently sent a bipartisan bill to the President‚Äôs desk to improve the VA Choice Program, which will reduce out-of-pocket costs for veterans and remove current barriers to the timely disclosure of veteran medical records.  The House also passed legislation last month to address the glaring lack of accountability within the VA. The VA Accountability First Act would provide the VA Secretary increased flexibility to remove poorly performing employees and protect whistle-blowers who expose misconduct.  Providing our veterans with quality, reliable health coverage is a top priority, and I will continue advocating for VA reforms that prioritize the well-being of our nation‚Äôs veterans.","link","https://walters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walters-comments-recent-progress-reform-va-and-improve-veterans-health","alters.house.gov",32,19,8,2,0,0,0,2

In my district located in Orange County, California, opioid-related drug overdoses and deaths have tragically kept pace with the rapid increase in abuse.  Last week, I signed a bipartisan letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the implementation of the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act (CARA), which provides resources and necessary reforms to address the nation‚Äôs opioid epidemic.  CARA seeks to ensure that patients are offered, and physicians are trained on, a full range of FDA-approved treatment options. Prior to this legislation, pain medication treatments were often prescribed based on the patient‚Äôs setting of care, not the patient‚Äôs needs.  We can no longer accept such casual prescription of these powerful and addictive drugs that often lead to the abuse of illegal substances like heroin.  I applaud my fellow Members of Congress who remain engaged in our efforts to combat opioid abuse.  I am committed to ensuring CARA is fully implemented to put an end to this epidemic, which claims far too many lives.","link","https://walters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walters-writes-secretary-price-regarding-growing-opioid-epidemic","alters.house.gov",43,22,0,0,0,0,1,1

Our legislation, the American Health Care Act, will lower premiums and expand choices for hard working Americans.  It will also continue to ensure guaranteed coverage regardless of an individual‚Äôs health status, and allow families to keep children on their insurance plans until age 26.  Since I decided to run for Congress, I gave the people of Orange County my word that I would work to ensure all Americans have access to an affordable, patient-centered healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act has clearly failed the American people through unaffordable premiums and deductibles, massive tax burdens on small businesses, and collapsing healthcare exchanges.  I am honored to join my colleagues in the House to pass this landmark legislation for the American people.","link","https://walters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-walters-today-house-delivered-promise-improve-healthcare-all","alters.house.gov",187,886,56,25,7,3,18,752
