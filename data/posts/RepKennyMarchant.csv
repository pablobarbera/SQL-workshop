Lieutenant Young served his country in the U.S. Navy during WWII and was a survivor of the Battle of Iwo Jima. After returning from the War, he acquired his Master's degree from the University of North Texas and resumed his Texas High School Football coaching career.  He is listed as an Outstanding High School Football Coach in North Texas. Cy is one of 10 honorees in Bowie High School history to be in the graduate Hall of Honor. He is the Founder of the Iwo Jima Survivors Association  and has a Street named after him in Wichita Falls, TX.  I was fortunate to spend time with Lt. Young at the 2016 Veteran's Fair and recognize him for his service to his community and his country.

The legacy of Obamacare is out-of-control premiums, fewer choices for patients, and unaffordable deductibles. Today, I voted again to repeal and dismantle Obamacare. After listening to the concerns of my constituents regarding pre-existing conditions, after significant patient protections were added, and after ensuring Congress was not exempted from this legislation, I support advancing this bill to the Senate. American health insurance is in crisis, reform is not a choice, it’s a necessity.  Right now one-third of all counties in the United States have only one insurance option and that number is climbing. Just yesterday it was reported that the entire state of Iowa could be left with no individual options to purchase health insurance in 2018. This crisis won’t fix itself. Millions of Americans have opted to pay a fine to the government and remain uninsured because it’s actually cheaper than Obamacare premiums.  Continued improvements will be made to stabilize the industry that’s crumbling around us. This is about dismantling the Obamacare regulations that have hurt so many families and businesses in Texas. Right now, an elderly couple in Texas making $80,000 a year is mandated by Washington to buy one-size-fits-all insurance they don’t want or need. Under the AHCA, this couple would now receive an $8,000 tax credit to buy insurance that actually fits their lifestyle. Conservative principles like this have been part health insurance discussions for decades.  We’ve seen what happens when Washington bureaucrats take charge of health insurance – health care plans you’re forced to buy but can’t afford to use. Choosing between Obamacare and the American Health Care Act is a false choice, because Obamacare is collapsing. Saying no is easy, saving insurance for American families before it’s gone is worth a yes.”","status",NA,NA,150,342,36,5,1,3,6,195

Just like their driver’s license, this legislation ensures that the Constitutional rights of my constituents and of all Americans follow them to every state.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepKennyMarchant/videos/10155707266777900/",NA,216,100,21,11,1,1,3,57

That's why I'm a cosponsor of HR 4494 The Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act.   This bill:  ➡ Prohibits the future use of taxpayer dollars to pay sexual harassment and sexual assault claims against members of Congress and staff.  ➡ Prohibits members of Congress from using office budgets to camouflage payments.  ➡ Requires members of Congress and staff that have ever been named in a sexual harassment or sexual assault settlement paid for by taxpayers reimburse the U.S. Treasury with interest.  ➡ Allows any individual who received an award to make public statements about the claims notwithstanding the terms of a nondisclosure agreement and nondisclosure agreements cannot be made a condition of any future settlements.   Swift action should be taken to move this bill through Congress.

Congress and the new Administration came into this year committed to cutting red tape in Washington, D.C. Less regulation saves taxpayers money, lets small businesses grow and create jobs, and increases freedom for all Americans. The goal was to cut two rules for every one created.   This week, the Administration delivered its progress report to Congress. Instead of a 2 to 1 ratio, federal agencies have rolled back regulations at a rate of 22 to 1. Saving taxpayers over $8 billion in the process.
