This legislation establishes a simple, rapid-response method for Congress to undo abusive and overly burdensome “midnight” rules submitted during the final legislative days of Congress by an outgoing administration.  Americans can no longer bear these burdens, and I’m pleased that this bill will not only deter lame-duck Presidents from shuffling in last-minute regulations, but it will also create an efficient method for any incoming Congress to express its disapproval and reverse them.","link","http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/312568-gop-lawmaker-brings-back-bill-attacking-midnight-rules","thehill.com",238,20,30,13,0,0,0,4

Simply put, Obamacare is an expensive failure that is unpopular, unworkable, and unaffordable.  By passing S. Con. Res. 3, we opened a procedural door to repealing this deeply flawed law, following through on our promise to the American people. While conversations about the replacement plan are ongoing, rest assured that there will be a smooth transition period between the current system and a new free-market healthcare system that is patient-centered. Americans deserve the freedom to buy coverage that is right for their needs and budgets, not the needs of Washington. With President-elect Donald Trump and Rep. Tom Price at the helm, Congress will pass legislation that will increase access to the care Americans need, at a price they can afford.  This budget resolution is far from perfect. It is a snapshot of where we’ve been under the Obama Administration, not a roadmap of where we need to go moving forward. Time and again, President Obama has ignored the staggering losses caused by his flawed policies simply to preserve his legacy. As soon as the Trump Administration is able to submit a budget to Congress detailing its priorities, Congress will debate more conservative budget proposals designed to restore fiscal order and achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. Today’s vote was a vote for relief for Americans who have been suffering for too long under a burdensome system. It’s time to make healthcare work for all Americans.","link","http://hice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1043","hice.house.gov",328,85,41,19,0,1,2,26

The Hyde Amendment has been a staple of protecting the unborn for 40 years, saving more than two million lives, including 99,350 lives in the State of Georgia. Needless to say, it is vital that we keep it in place. I am pleased that President Trump has made it abundantly clear that the Administration is committed to a consistent, government-wide policy that no taxpayer dollars should fund abortion or the abortion industry — either domestically or internationally. With the President’s commitment and the action taken today by the House, we will continue fighting for the culture of life.  Additionally, I recently introduced H.R. 586, the Sanctity of Human Life Act. The Sanctity of Human Life Act defines life as beginning at fertilization, defending the inalienable right to life protected by the Constitution. In the Declaration of Independence, our Founding Fathers affirmed that everyone is endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, chief among them being life.   Today, with the right to life under attack, now more than ever before, we must stand up as advocates for the unborn. Our culture must affirm the value of the weak and vulnerable in our society, beginning with our children. With that in mind, I introduced the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which rightly defines life as beginning at conception. I am proud of this legislation and proud to be a voice for the unborn with clarity and conviction.","link","http://hice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1083","hice.house.gov",483,125,71,62,0,0,1,23

Below is an excerpt of the piece:  ""The criticism that our legislation would subsidize religious organizations’ politics demonstrates a double standard for faith-based entities. Leaders and employees of other entities that receive federal funding — such as hospitals and universities — are welcome to advocate for political causes and contribute to them. The IRS does not threaten to punish them when they engage in political speech. Critics who say this blur the line between church and state misunderstand the principle. Thomas Jefferson’s “separation” coinage doesn’t mean that there is a wall of separation between the two; it just means that the state should not have control over the church, nor shall the church maintain control over the state.  The First Amendment right of free speech and right to practice any faith, or no faith, are fundamental American values that must extend to everyone, no matter if they’re a Jewish rabbi, a Buddhist monk, a Baptist pastor or a Muslim imam. Some bristle at the thought of their faith leader or pastor speaking about politics from the pulpit. We fully understand that concern, but that’s a conversation for each individual congregation to have. Likewise, the donor market will shape nonprofit demand on its own as well. If an employee of a nonprofit organization voices political opinion against the wishes of donors, the employee or nonprofit can restrict that speech according to donor demand. An individual can express their objection to what they may deem as political speech; that is freedom at its best. But the government shouldn’t have the authority to sanction or stifle speech.""","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/05/american-nonprofits-including-churches-should-be-allowed-to-take-sides-in-politics/?utm_term=.91debe8c2f5c","washingtonpost.com",99,90,19,2,0,1,0,16

Unfortunately, that’s not the case when it comes to online communication and the Fourth Amendment. Under current law – which dates back to 1986 – the federal government can access your emails, text messages, documents, videos, or sound recordings that have been opened, are older than 180 days, or stored in the cloud without a warrant from a court of law.   To put it in perspective, the laws governing email privacy haven’t been updated in three decades, and federal agencies – like the IRS – are able to use this loophole to snoop through the private conversations of law-abiding American citizens and use those messages against them. Needless to say, this statute is outdated and must reflect the new age.  Today, the House took action to protect our constitutional rights without impeding the efforts of law enforcement to ensure public safety by unanimously passing H.R. 387, the Email Privacy Act. This measure creates a uniform warrant standard to obtain all electronic communications in criminal and civil investigations, clarifies privacy rights for cloud computing services, and maintains Congressional oversight authority.

The first – H.R. 1047, the Fairness in Firearms Testing Act – will help restore accountability to firearms testing. The second – H.R. 1149, the Nuclear Family Priority Act – is a reform to our immigration system.   As many you of know, I firmly believe that our Second Amendment right to bear arms is one of the most fundamental and basic rights established in the Constitution, allowing Americans to have the ability to protect themselves, their families, and their property. Part of the protection of this right is ensuring that the agencies responsible for the testing of firearms, such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), have clear guidelines in place. Due to a lack of uniformity, and occasionally unfair procedures for firearms testing, many firearms manufacturers could face added pressures of fines, license revocation, and even jail time as a punishment for routine clerical errors.  My bill, H.R. 1047, the Fairness in Firearms Testing Act, would require the ATF to make video recordings of the testing and examination of firearms and ammunition and would prohibit the agency from editing or erasing these recordings. This will ensure that video documentation – often used by gun makers to contest and review testing decisions – exists and brings greater uniformity and transparency to this process. Safeguarding our Second Amendment rights is of the upmost importance, and I will continue working to preserve our Constitutionally-protected rights.  Meanwhile, H.R. 1149, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, would take crucial steps forward to reform an antiquated immigration selection process by addressing the phenomenon known as “chain migration.” Today, chain migration allows one immigrant to serve as the basis for dozens or even hundreds of other legal immigrants in a 15-year period simply due to extended family ties. This trend has caused legal immigration into the United States to spike from around 250,000 per year in the 1950s and 1960s to the more than 1 million annually.   My legislation would reduce the number of family-sponsored immigrants by eliminating the extended family visa categories for adult siblings and adult children, thereby ending chain migration and allowing us to prioritize nuclear families by limiting this group to the spouses and minor children of both naturalized citizens and lawful permanent residents. The Nuclear Family Priority Act would ensure immediate families can stay together while also protecting the interests of our Nation.  The Fairness in Firearms Testing Act and the Nuclear Family Priority Act are both practical and commonsense solutions, and I am proud to introduce these two pieces of legislation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanJodyHice/photos/a.657903340984792.1073741828.651078621667264/1100868353354953/?type=3",NA,176,31,29,8,0,1,0,3

In Fiscal Year 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs had over 300 employees – nurses, therapists, pharmacists, a physician, and even a prosthetic limb specialist – who were hired to serve our brave warriors but instead operated exclusively on official time. Rather than helping our heroes, these individuals spend all their time engaging in union activities such as collective bargaining, filing complaints or grievances, and even grassroots lobbying. This is unacceptable and a grave misuse of valuable resources.   Through my committee work, I’ve questioned many agency heads about their management of official time, and each time, the wasteful pattern emerges and is left unchecked. Simply put, paying federal employees to do union work interferes with providing the services that taxpayers deserve. In order to combat this waste of taxpayer money, the Official Time Reform Act is a much-needed action to overhauling this egregious practice as we seek greater accountability and transparency within our federal government.   Federal employees are free to engage in union activities on their own time, and they are free to use union resources and dues to fund those activities; however, taxpayer dollars should be used for public, not private, needs. I applaud the work that went into this legislation and look forward to its consideration on the House Floor.","link","http://hice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1162","hice.house.gov",189,40,53,4,0,6,1,12

Some federal employee union members engage exclusively in union business instead of doing the job they were hired to do, all while collecting full pay and benefits from taxpayers. For most Americans, spending significant time at work doing something unrelated to our jobs would be a fireable offense, but for federal unions, it is business as usual.  These individuals on 100 percent official time create a tremendous amount of slack to the detriment of their agency — and the taxpayer. Take, for example, the roughly 350 Department of Veterans Affairs employees who operated solely on official time in fiscal year 2015. Among these individuals are much-needed nurses, pharmacists, addiction therapists, a physician and even a prosthetic limb specialist. Rather than providing critical healthcare services to our nation’s veterans, these union members spend their entire working days on union duties like collective bargaining and arbitrating grievances. Their work is going undone — veterans left uncared for — because they are working on behalf of their union, leaving others to pick up the slack or even forcing the VA to hire new healthcare professionals to perform the duties they were originally hired to do.  To address this problem, I have introduced H.R. 1364, the Official Time Reform Act, which would prohibit federal employees who spend 80 percent or more of their time on official time from counting that as creditable service under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employee Retirement System and from receiving bonuses. If an individual was hired to fit prosthetic limbs on veterans’ combat injuries, that is what they should be doing — not somewhere litigating employee grievances or conducting other union business every hour of every work day. My legislation does not eliminate or even curtail official time use. Even if you support official time, as some of my colleagues do, we should all be able to agree that federal employees who work exclusively on behalf of their union instead of the taxpayer should not earn bonuses or retirement benefits paid for by the taxpayer.  My legislation is further needed because the abuse of official time is systemic and has led to unacceptable failures in government agencies. Look at the Internal Revenue Service for instance. Its customer service levels are at an all-time low. In fact, in 2015, just 38 percent of callers seeking assistance actually ended up reaching an IRS representative. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen himself described his own agency’s performance as “abysmal.” Despite this agency-wide crisis, the IRS has several dozen customer service representatives working 100 percent official time, doing nothing but union business. If these civil servants were doing their actual jobs instead of representing the union, the IRS could be answering thousands of more calls from taxpayers in need.","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/324873-shining-lights-on-shady-practices","thehill.com",85,82,17,5,0,0,0,16

Trump signed H.J. Res. 43 into law, overturning President Obama’s last minute, parting gift to the abortion industry. The resolution ensures that states are not forced to fund an abortion business, like Planned Parenthood, with federal taxpayer dollars.  Putting these decisions back at the state level will give communities the option to spend Title X money on comprehensive health care clinics that better serve women and girls. I was proud to vote for this measure in February, and I’m grateful to have a President that is willing to sign critical pro-life measures into law.","link","http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/13/donald-trump-gives-states-power-cut-planned-parent/","washingtontimes.com",227,53,25,25,0,2,3,44

I’ve fought since day one to roll back Obamacare’s government takeover of our health care system. After a full evaluation, countless meetings and negotiations, input from my constituents, and with the addition of the MacArthur Amendment, I will be supporting the American Health Care Act.  I commend President Trump, Vice President Pence, Speaker Ryan, and my colleagues for keeping the lines of communication open, which has ultimately led to a better bill. Due to our collaborative work, the AHCA now immediately eliminates Obamacare taxes that would have otherwise remained, creates a work requirement for adult able-bodied recipients of Medicaid, includes the Palmer Amendment to ensure affordable coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions, and drives down premiums and costs for all Americans across the board.  The MacArthur Amendment empowers states to seek and obtain waivers from Obamacare’s premium-spiking mandates and takes steps to rid the health care law of its most costly provisions.   While the battle for a full repeal is not over, implementing conservative provisions that keep the legislative process focused on free-market, patient-centered health care, lower costs for consumers, and provide greater access to care for all Americans is a victory. I will continue to search for solutions that offer more relief for hardworking American families, and we will work with our Senate colleagues to further improve the AHCA and deliver on our promises.","link","http://hice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1247","hice.house.gov",252,147,34,24,2,0,4,63

To name a few:  • Since President Trump took office, Congress passed and the President has signed 28 bills into law. (That’s a bill being signed into law every three days.)  • 13 of those bills were Congressional Review Acts, known as CRAs. These now laws will roll back the regulatory regime that was put in place by the Obama Administration, and according to the American Action Forum, they have already saved taxpayers more than $86 billion in regulatory costs.   • President Trump nominated and the Senate confirmed a new Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch, who is a conservative replacement in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia.   •Despite the obstruction by Senate Democrats, the Senate has confirmed 25 cabinet nominees, including Georgia’s own Secretary Tom Price as the head of HHS and Secretary Sonny Perdue as the leader of USDA.   • President Trump has kept his promise to put America First by stepping up the fight against the Islamic State and evil around the world, including dropping the “Mother Of All Bombs” on ISIS fighters in Afghanistan, launching 59 cruise missiles against Assad for his horrific war crimes against his own people, and holding strong against a rogue North Korea.   • President Trump presented a plan to secure the border, including requesting proposals for construction of the border wall and hiring additional border patrol agents.  • President Trump introduced a plan to cut taxes for all Americans and simplify the tax code.  With a renewed focus on returning security and prosperity to our Nation, we are working together to implement tax reform, secure our borders, and jumpstart our economy.

""It’s the people we love — our children, friends and neighbors — who are the inspiration behind our American Health Care Act, which we passed in the House on Thursday.  We’re working hard to build a health-care system that puts the American people back at the center of their health decisions. We’ve had conversations — tough conversations — with people from all walks of life, and we’ve passed a bill that we’re confident will improve lives.  To me, protecting people with preexisting conditions isn’t just good policy — it’s a personal mission.  All across the country, families like mine have real concerns about the future of health care, and they are why we’re focusing on results and working on these reforms. Obamacare is wrong for America. It has failed, and it’s only getting worse — making health care more expensive and less accessible. To stand by and do nothing would be irresponsible. The AHCA is a monumental step forward that trusts the American people — not the federal government — to make the best decisions for themselves and their families.""","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-son-has-a-preexisting-condition-hes-one-of-the-reasons-i-voted-for-the-ahca/2017/05/04/26c234b2-30fd-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.0ddba96d2012","washingtonpost.com",76,125,18,7,1,0,2,78

This was a free, informational event to talk with people affected by Alzheimer’s about their experiences and help provide support for dealing with this debilitating disease. My mother suffered from Alzheimer’s, and I know firsthand the pain and difficulties experienced by those attempting to care for their loved ones suffering from it. I was extremely proud to be joined by the Georgia Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association to give information and provide a network for people seeking help.   Rather than reporting this story and without seeking a thorough understanding of the event taking place, 11 ""A Lie News"" and Doug Richards decided that a catchy, misleading headline outweighed their responsibility to maintain journalistic integrity. This lazy and shoddy reporting demonstrates nothing more than a desire to paint a one-sided story - that I left early to run and hide. That's completely false. I left because I had another engagement immediately following the forum nearly 50 minutes away in Wilkes County and coordinated with the hosts to address those time restraints. However, the program continued and my staff stayed until the very end.    There were no protesters and no hostility, because the event didn’t warrant any. What did transpire was a community of people in difficult circumstances coming together to provide information and support. That is the story that should be reported.","status",NA,NA,141,82,44,5,7,7,12,22

Today, the House took major strides toward enforcing the law of the land and protecting American communities with the passage of the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate’s Law.

Simply put, an innovative, flexible, and agile military force is vital to keeping America safe, our allies assured, and our enemies deterred.

While these are important issues we’re tackling, they’ve also drowned out some of the other valuable things Congress is doing. With that in mind, I want to take the time to outline a few of my own legislative proposals I’m very proud to be introducing in the coming months.  Just a few short weeks ago, the House passed Kate’s Law to crack down on sanctuary cities after witnessing the devastation that can arise from policies that effectively roll out the welcome mat for illegal immigrants. Perhaps even more shocking, however, are the loopholes in our legal system that allow these criminal aliens who are sex offenders to wander freely around our communities without being registered on sex offender rolls and without the knowledge of our law enforcement officials. My bill, the Sex Offender Registration & Tracking Improvement Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to collect extensive information about these offenders and share it with the Department of Justice, as well as local law enforcement, to ensure that these criminals are placed on sex offender registries.  All sex offenders — regardless of immigration status — should be identified and registered.  Public safety must not be a partisan issue, and I am proud to be introducing this bill soon.  Another measure I’m working on is the Strengthening Aviation Security Act. Since 2001, the Transportation Security Administration has aimed to increase the number of federal air marshals they place on flights. However, in deciding which flights they are placed on, the Government Accountability Office found the TSA fails to use a quantitative risk assessment to clearly demonstrate which flights are higher risk and therefore deserving of extra attention.  When it comes to protecting our skies, we need to use every method at our disposal. This includes both the qualitative professional judgment of experts and quantitative evidence-based strategies. The Strengthening Aviation Security Act would require the Federal Air Marshal Service incorporate risk-based strategies in deciding domestic and international air marshal allocation.  Please know, although I’ll be heading down to Georgia for the August “recess,” my legislative and constituent work will continue. I’ll be taking meetings and visiting with folks across the district to hear what’s most important to you and discuss how we can move forward together.  You may rest assured my team and I are working day in and day out to enact meaningful legislation that will benefit the citizens of the 10th District, our state and our great nation.","link","http://www.waltontribune.com/opinion/columns/article_c1362766-73c3-11e7-a68b-83303aa3e1c8.html","waltontribune.com",28,18,1,0,1,0,0,0

Addressing the ever-rising tide of chain migration, while admitting immigrants based on the skills they bring to the table is the type of immigration reform America needs. Under the current law, one immigrant can serve as a catalyst for up to 273 other legal immigrants entering our country based solely on genetics.  I’ve introduced a bill in the House, H.R. 1149, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, which would eliminate extended family visa categories for adult siblings and adult children, thereby clamping down on chain migration and allowing us to instead prioritize the reunification of nuclear families (spouses and minor children) of both citizens and lawful permanent residents. In other words, it addresses the assumption that legal status will be granted to the extended family of legal immigrants, regardless of their ability to contribute to our nation.  The American Dream is something that is worth fighting for and protecting, but it's not a guarantee. In the spirit of the American dream, this legislation does not hinder the efforts of legal immigrants to reunite with their immediate families in America, but instead prevents abuse of our already overwhelmed immigration system.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorDavidPerdue/videos/660465720817822/",NA,107,42,0,9,1,1,0,25

Simply put, we cannot repeat this legacy in Afghanistan.   I am pleased that President Trump articulated a strategy rooted in taking the fight directly to the terrorists, lifting engagement restrictions which have for so long tied the hands of our troops in theater, and applying pressure to our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan to more aggressively combat terrorists operating within their borders.

The atrocity that ends the life of an unborn baby when that child can live outside the womb and feel the pain inflicted by violent procedures is unconscionable. I firmly believe that all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. Unfortunately, the United States remains one of only seven nations, in the same company as North Korea and China, that allows abortions after 20 weeks – a practice that kills thousands of innocent babies each year.  Today, I’m pleased that H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which will stem late-term abortions at 20 weeks or greater, advanced through the House. This incremental measure is an improvement over existing policy and mirrors our own state law banning abortions at 20 weeks or later. I’m hopeful that additional pro-life legislation, like H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, and H.R. 586, the Sanctity of Human Life, will be considered as we continue our efforts to defend the defenseless and champion the cause for life.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanJodyHice/photos/a.657903340984792.1073741828.651078621667264/1297262287048891/?type=3",NA,310,130,72,49,0,1,4,49

In 1966, Mr. Watson was one of the heroic men during the Cold War who was involved in the cleanup efforts after a B-52 bomber collided with a KC-135 tanker over Palomares, Spain, releasing four hydrogen bombs. After his service, Mr. Watson suffered from severe medical problems and was ultimately diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2002.   Nolan is survived by his loving wife, Nona, who has been a fierce and dedicated advocate for her husband, working tirelessly throughout the years to garner the recognition these young men deserved for the sacrifices they made in responding to this unfortunate disaster.

Simply put, justice must be blind.  Below are Chairmen Gowdy and Goodlatte’s thoughts:  “Our justice system is represented by a blind-folded woman holding a set of scales. Those scales do not tip to the right or the left; they do not recognize wealth, power, or social status. The impartiality of our justice system is the bedrock of our republic and our fellow citizens must have confidence in its objectivity, independence, and evenhandedness. The law is the most equalizing force in this country. No entity or individual is exempt from oversight.   “Decisions made by the Department of Justice in 2016 have led to a host of outstanding questions that must be answered. These include, but are not limited to:  • FBI’s decision to publicly announce the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s handling of classified information but not to publicly announce the investigation into campaign associates of then-candidate Donald Trump; • FBI’s decision to notify Congress by formal letter of the status of the investigation both in October and November of 2016; • FBI’s decision to appropriate full decision making in respect to charging or not charging Secretary Clinton to the FBI rather than the DOJ; and • FBI’s timeline in respect to charging decisions.  “The Committees will review these decisions and others to better understand the reasoning behind how certain conclusions were drawn. Congress has a constitutional duty to preserve the integrity of our justice system by ensuring transparency and accountability of actions taken.”  More- https://oversight.house.gov/release/gowdy-goodlatte-open-investigation-decisions-made-doj-2016/","status",NA,NA,241,152,36,21,5,1,3,40

A major step in accomplishing a substantial overhaul of our complicated and burdensome tax system is passing a budget.  It has been over 30 years since we have passed comprehensive tax reform. For too long, we’ve watched the American middle class struggle and many businesses stifled as they try to grow. Our corporate tax code is the highest in the world, forcing many companies to go overseas. Simply put, the status quo isn’t working.  In the coming week, the full text of our plan is expected to be released. It will include concrete details on how we’re going to achieve the wide-ranging transformation Americans so desperately need, while allowing middle-class families and small businesses to keep much, much more of their hard-earned income.

At the IRS, there has been an ongoing culture of intimidation, and I think it has been well-documented that this agency has been in dire straits for some time.   In 2013, Commissioner John Koskinen was appointed by President Obama as a “turnaround” man – to save the agency from spiraling out of control following the scandal that targeted conservative groups, institute reform and transparency, and restore the public’s trust in the agency. None of these things have happened. Instead, the IRS and its leadership have continued placing themselves above the law.   Because of his ineffectiveness and deliberate deception of Congress, I’ve consistently called for the censure, impeachment, and removal of John Koskinen as the head of the agency.   Last Friday, I was pleased to hear that President Trump has selected a replacement, and John Koskinen will no longer be at the helm effective November 12th. This is a victory for the American people and is one more important step toward creating a more transparent and accountable federal government.","status",NA,NA,103,48,5,9,5,1,0,2

In reality, more than 97 million households in the bottom 3/5 of the tax brackets will be receiving a tax cut, and every single tax bracket will be taxed less with this revolutionary bill.   “In their haste to condemn the GOP tax plan, Democrats have spread far and wide the false claim that families making less than $86,100 on average will face a hefty tax hike.

My staff and I are continuing to dig through the bill with a fine-toothed comb to make sure there are no unpleasant surprises for you, but from what I’ve seen, it looks like a big step in the right direction. Folks back home will see a dramatic reduction in their tax rates, while getting to keep a lot more of their hard-earned money when tax time comes.  According to the nonpartisan, independent Tax Foundation, in Georgia alone, this tax bill is expected to create nearly 30,000 new jobs, and increase families’ income by over $2,300! That’s more money to save for retirement, your next vacation, or an upcoming home project. It also brings simplicity and common sense back to our convoluted tax code by streamlining the filing process so that more than 90% of American families will be able to do their taxes on a piece of paper the size of a postcard.

In an effort to preserve the legacy of those who have faithfully served our country, I want to share the account of William Smith, of Sandersville, a U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1974.  Through the Veterans History Project, an initiative of the Library of Congress, a member of my staff sat down with Mr. Smith in July, when he described wartime stresses and “the weeks in the jungle with mosquitoes, ants, and leeches.” He first enlisted right out of school at the age of 18 and trained at Fort Benning in Columbus, where he learned “how to kill and how to survive,” as well as how to be “an American soldier.” As part of the 2nd Battalion 27th Infantry Wolfhounds Unit, he rose in rank to become a squad leader for Company D and established a reputation as a dedicated, energetic, and expert servicemember.  Read more of Mr. Smith's remarkable story below.","link","https://www.covnews.com/news/william-smith-other-veterans-epitomize-nations-greatness/","covnews.com",25,5,0,1,0,0,0,0

Hardworking Americans are tired of struggling under a weak economy. They are ready for relief and the House is ready to deliver that relief. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a step forward for American workers and American families and will usher in a new era of prosperity in America. The measure that passed today lowers tax rates, simplifies the code, doubles the standard deduction, and increases the child tax credit, all of which will put more money into the pockets of Americans and give them more flexibility when it comes to spending their hard-earned dollars.  By lowering taxes on small businesses and other job creators, our plan also makes the reforms necessary to boost our economy, while giving Americans access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure and successful future. I commend House Way and Means Chairman Kevin Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan for their leadership throughout this process. While there are still steps left before any tax laws are changed, I’m optimistic and look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the Trump Administration to ensure that a pro-growth, pro-family, and pro-worker tax reform package is signed into law.","link","https://hice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1654","hice.house.gov",121,82,9,9,1,1,2,43

When they fell under fire once again, Hunter eliminated the threat and helped load the wounded into a helicopter to be evacuated. In total, Staff Sgt. Hunter’s actions that day eliminated 27 enemy forces and saved his team. Without his help, many American servicemembers surely would have been lost that day.

Bush addressed the nation and declared, “These acts shattered steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.” Without question, none of us will forget the heinous attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  These acts of hate forever changed America and transformed our perceptions and protocols when it comes to the safety and security of our airlines. Just a few months after 9/11, passengers aboard a flight traveling from Paris to Miami deterred an al-Qaida operative, Richard Reid, who had explosives concealed in his shoes. In 2006, an al-Qaida terrorist plot, which involved liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks, was also foiled. Yet another failed al-Qaida plot to bring down an airliner – in 2009 – was based on the use of plastic explosives hidden in the underwear of a terrorist.  Under the current system, FAMS and Transportation Security Administration consider a number of different factors in determining which flights marshals will be on, including travel budget, number of personnel and other qualitative risk factors. However, it lacks substantive quantitative data. The Strengthening Aviation Security Act will ensure federal air marshals are collecting better data and devoting its resources to the highest-risk flights in order to deter, detect and disrupt plots devised by our adversaries.  We live in a dangerous world, and public safety should always be a priority. Threats are coming from many different directions, and we must counteract our enemies by every means open to us.

With every taxpayer keeping more of their hard-earned money and a turbo-charged economy that will result in more jobs and higher incomes, we are turning the page on a broken and antiquated tax code.   It has been 31 years since Americans have seen a real cut in taxes, and now the majority of people will see a positive impact on their wallets, thanks to the system laid out in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. By the beginning of February, Americans will start seeing their paychecks grow as the amount of their tax withholdings goes down. Additionally, businesses and job creators will have the ability to offer better opportunities for more people.  Although no piece of legislation is perfect, with this sweeping tax overhaul, we're allowing the American people to keep more of their money, we’re making our Nation more competitive for job creation and wage growth, and we’re igniting the kind of economic growth that every American deserves.
