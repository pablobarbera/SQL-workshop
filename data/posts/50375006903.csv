I would have gladly supported appropriations for actual emergency relief, but I could not in good conscience support something that would have been a spending spree for unrelated programs. That actual bill, however, was laden with non-emergency pork.   The bill authorized a total of $50.5 billion in spending. But, that bill even included such things as salary increases for the FBI, and massive more spending for things that should go through annual appropriations like Head Start. It clearly was consistent, though, with the Obama administration‚Äôs position that they were not going to let what they called a ‚Äúgood crisis go to waste.‚Äù  Rachel Bovard, Senior Director of Policy for The Conservative Partnership, recently revisited the relief bill and reported that, ‚Äúonly around half of the bill ended up actually being for (Hurricane) Sandy relief.‚Äù   Congress should not pack so much NON-emergency spending into an emergency relief bill.
