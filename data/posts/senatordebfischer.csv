While she would not be my first choice to be Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos is our president's first choice. I took my time carefully reviewing her record and the transcript of her hearing. I contacted her to express my steadfast support of state and local control, as well as the need to ensure our students with disabilities have access to the resources they need to receive a quality education.    I requested and received assurances from Secretary DeVos in writing, which I made public at the time and you can view below, that she would not impose new federal mandates or force charter schools on states like Nebraska where that model does not work.    Under the past two administrations, one-size-fits-all federal mandates and requirements failed to deliver. No Child Left Behind and the flawed Common Core were not successful in preparing our students with the knowledge and skills they needed for the future. In Nebraska, we have always valued local control. We believe parents, teachers, school boards, and communities should make the decisions to meet the needs of our children.    Secretary DeVos reinforced a commitment to federalism and local control; that is my primary concern when it comes to a federal education secretary. It's what I have fought for in my 30 years of advocacy for public education and students. I believe there is an extremely limited role for the federal government in education, and I believe Secretary DeVos understands and respects those limitations. While I realize some Nebraskans do not agree with this decision, I am committed to holding Secretary DeVos to her word.    Many Nebraskans have contacted me about this issue. I appreciate their input and thank them for taking the time to express their opinions. Reasonable people will disagree from time to time on important issues facing our nation, but please know that even when we disagree, I always listen to your point of view.   With a busy Senate session, I do my best to hold meetings and visit with as many Nebraskans as possible. I have every intention of continuing my longstanding tradition of Listening Sessions and Community Coffees across the state and in communities small and large.    Nebraskans understand the best way to exchange ideas is through respectful civil discourse. I look forward to continuing these conversations with you.","link","http://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/78c34da0-9572-4826-93a2-2fe532ebad14/fischer-letter-final-feb-2.pdf","fischer.senate.gov",773,839,142,57,5,4,37,473

Americans all over our great country are celebrating our nation’s independence. Throughout our history, the Fourth of July has offered us a chance to reflect on the things that bring us together. It stands as a reminder that our shared values are why we live in an exceptional nation.  This year is no different.  The fireworks celebrations from Boston, Massachusetts to Seattle, Washington to Seward, Nebraska, America’s Fourth of July City, show how the fabric that binds our nation together is stronger than any distance or disagreement that may appear to be pulling us apart. Through good times and bad, the belief that we have God-given rights has guided our country. America has been called the city on a hill, and our Declaration of Independence is what fuels the beacon of hope in a world filled with challenges and uncertainty.  Our founding document brings us together. It reminds us that the United States is a force for good, and its words give us direction as we work to make the world better.  No state has illustrated this more than Nebraska. 150 years ago, our state celebrated the first Independence Day as a full member of the Union. Our statehood helped the country take one step closer to fulfilling the principles our founders set out in the Declaration.  Nebraska was the first state admitted to the Union by Congress after the Civil War, but our admission was contested. President Johnson vetoed our entry. He disagreed with a “fundamental condition” of Nebraska statehood: that African-American men be allowed to vote and hold the same standing as their white counterparts.  A legislative battle soon followed. Fortunately, the forces for equality prevailed. Congress overrode Johnson’s veto, and on March 1, 1867, Nebraska became a state with its “fundamental condition” intact.  Our state joining the Union served as a pivotal moment for our country. Nebraska gave America a chance to be better—to take one more step toward creating the “more perfect Union” mentioned in the Constitution’s preamble.  With Nebraska statehood, America reached for a future more closely aligned with ideals we declared to be universal. Although there was, and still is, more work to be done, Nebraska’s star on the American flag serves as a piece of evidence to the world that Americans really do “hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”  Happy Independence Day! Please remember that our shared values will hold our communities together and remind us how lucky we are to live in the best nation on Earth.","status",NA,NA,296,134,24,24,3,2,5,52

This was a pre-scheduled, highly technical launch and one of many tests our military conducts every year to ensure that our defenses are safe and reliable.  Technical hurdles remain before North Korea can carry out a nuclear strike against our country, but we should expect Kim Jong Un to reach that objective.

Scenes of this dark day in history that drastically changed the course of this nation are forever etched in our memory.    But 9/11 did not change who we are or the values we hold so dear. Amidst the heartbreak and devastation, our citizens showed abounding courage, kindness, and love of country. In New York City, Arlington, and a scarred field in Shanksville, American flags were placed atop the rubble as symbols of proof that evil cannot break us.     We will always remember the innocent lives lost in the attack. There will forever be gratitude in our hearts to the brave first responders who ran toward, not away from, danger to help those in need. The significant work of the men and women of STRATCOM during this national emergency will not be forgotten.

When Senator Sasse and I launched our open process to fill this seat on the Eighth Circuit, Steve was the only candidate we wanted to recommend to the president. Steve is an outstanding Nebraskan who possesses exceptional intellect, skill, and judgement. He has an impressive list of professional achievements earned during his distinguished career in appellate litigation that spans nearly three decades. He enjoys broad bipartisan support from Nebraskans including former Senator Ben Nelson and former U.S. Attorney for Nebraska Deborah Gilg.   During my remarks this morning, I also responded to the American Bar Association’s conclusion that Grasz is “not qualified” to serve on the Eighth Circuit. I urge members of the committee to recognize the ABA evaluation for what it is: a political character assassination of Steve, intended to damage his excellent legal reputation.   I am confident, and Nebraskans are confident, that Steve will faithfully uphold the Constitution and will apply the law neutrally, equally, and fairly to all people.
