I work hard to be accessible and try to respond as much as I can. The vote on health care yesterday generated a lot of feedback. Much of it was based on misinformation ‚Äì there is a lot of that in the media and on social media these days.   I also recognize there are a lot of folks who are genuinely concerned about what the new health care bill passed by the House yesterday means for you and for your family. If you feel this way, then I'm writing this post to you.   My decision to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that is patient-centered and has a robust marketplace that offers you more options is based on my concern for you and everyone I am blessed to represent in Congress. I have talked to many of my constituents with pre-existing conditions who couldn't get health care before the Affordable Care Act. I have talked to many more who cannot afford to use their insurance because they cannot pay the high deductibles.   Because of the Affordable Care Act, the health care market is collapsing in this country. Over one thousand counties have only one insurance option under Obamacare. Several states are on the verge of having no options. Premiums continue to skyrocket, deductibles are higher than many families can afford, and many of you are seeing your employer based insurance coverage shrink while your out of pocket costs increase.   The legislation we passed yesterday, the American Health Care Act, maintains protections that currently exist for pre-existing conditions but uses market forces to create more health insurance options so that you can purchase the insurance you need at a price you can afford.   Let me be clear, this legislation continues protections for pre-existing conditions established under the Affordable Care Act. Insurance companies cannot deny you coverage, and they cannot kick you off your plan based on your health status. States can apply for waivers to allow insurance plans offered in the state to be priced based on an individual's health status, but a waiver will only be approved if the state proves it has an adequate risk-sharing program in place to protect people with pre-existing conditions from being priced out of the market.   The legislation provides $130B to establish state risk pools and another $8B to cover anyone with a pre-existing condition. You can only be placed into this high risk pool if you do not have or you lapsed continuous coverage for more than 63 days. Continuous coverage means you have private insurance, COBRA, Medicare or Medicaid. The bottom line - the state risk pool would cover your care.  The legislation we passed yesterday isn't perfect and it's only phase one of our plan to make sure every American has the ability to purchase the insurance you want at a price you can afford. As always, I welcome your feedback.","status",NA,NA,94,173,30,6,1,0,3,48

The Chair of the House Republicans Conference, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, has a child with pre-existing conditions. I thought I would share an op-ed she wrote that ran in the Washington Post:  ""Hearing late-night host Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs emotional monologue this week about his son‚Äôs condition and his family‚Äôs experience in the moments after his birth, I had a flashback to the day my son was born and we learned he had Down syndrome.  My husband and I had a lot of questions about Cole‚Äôs future. Whether he‚Äôd have health care shouldn‚Äôt have had to be one of them. When you‚Äôre facing years of doctor‚Äôs appointments, you want to know that having a preexisting condition, such as an extra 21st chromosome or a heart defect, won‚Äôt prevent you or your loved ones from accessing the care you need.  Protections for children such as Cole Rodgers and Billy Kimmel have long existed, as they should. And despite what people are saying, House Republicans aren‚Äôt seeking to strip these protections ‚Äî or anyone‚Äôs protections ‚Äî away.   It‚Äôs the people we love ‚Äî our children, friends and neighbors ‚Äî who are the inspiration behind our American Health Care Act, which we passed in the House on Thursday. ...  ... To me, protecting people with preexisting conditions isn‚Äôt just good policy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a personal mission.""   So when you get challenged by some of the partisan propaganda out there, here are the facts:  The updated AHCA voted on yesterday is the same bill as before, but with three important changes.  Palmer/Schweikert Amendment creates a new federal risk-sharing program, a high-risk pool that will lower costs for people with pre-existing conditions and lower costs for everyone else.  The MacArthur Amendment allows states to apply for waivers to three of Obamacare‚Äôs costliest mandates: essential health benefits; age rating; and community rating, but only if the state has a risk-sharing program to help individuals with pre-existing conditions afford coverage.This new flexibility will allow states to design insurance frameworks that are right for their unique populations, providing superior care and lowering costs for patients.  The Upton-Long Amendment dedicates $8 billion solely to reducing premiums and other out-of-pocket costs for patients in the individual market with pre-existing conditions who do not maintain continuous coverage and who live in states that receive a waiver to redesign their insurance market.  --- https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-son-has-a-preexisting-condition-hes-one-of-the-reasons-i-voted-for-the-ahca/2017/05/04/26c234b2-30fd-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.5063a1618745","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-son-has-a-preexisting-condition-hes-one-of-the-reasons-i-voted-for-the-ahca/2017/05/04/26c234b2-30fd-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.5063a1618745","washingtonpost.com",82,99,58,1,1,3,1,41

While these reforms make a difference, there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do. As your Congressman, I will continue to work to completely overhaul our current system to make it simpler, fairer and flatter for everyone.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRichHudson/photos/a.212809395523304.55847.212153802255530/997734740364095/?type=3",NA,25,13,1,1,0,0,0,2

Mr. Young is the true embodiment of the Greatest Generation. He fought across Europe as part of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment‚Äôs reconnaissance squadron, earning a host of awards and commendations including two Silver Stars.  To honor his incredible service ‚Äì both on the battlefield and here in North Carolina ‚Äì I went to the floor of the House of Representatives and entered an award into the official Congressional Record.   As General Patton once said, ‚ÄúWars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains that victory.‚Äù There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Young played a defining role in our victory and his extraordinary character, humbleness, and decorated service will leave a lasting legacy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRichHudson/photos/a.212809395523304.55847.212153802255530/999319273538975/?type=3",NA,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
