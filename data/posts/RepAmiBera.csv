If you’re experiencing a power outage, follow these safety tips from Ready.Gov  *Only use flashlights for emergency lighting, candles can cause fires.  *Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed. An unopened refrigerator will keep food cold for about 4 hours. A full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours.  *Put on layers of warm clothing if it is cold outside. Never burn charcoal for heating or cooking indoors. Never use your oven as a source of heat. If the power may be out for a prolonged period, plan to go to another location (the home of a relative or friend, or a public facility) that has heat to keep warm.  *Turn off or disconnect appliances and other equipment in case of a momentary power “surge” that can damage computers and other devices.   *Only use generators away from your home and NEVER run a generator inside a home or garage, or connect it to your home's electrical system.","link","https://www.ready.gov/power-outages","ready.gov",51,2,3,0,0,1,0,0

It’s bad for Sacramento County, and it’s bad for California. Instead of making our middle class stronger, it will make it harder for hardworking Americans to get ahead.   This shortsighted budget makes it harder for our region to fund local projects, diminishes our ability to respond to floods or forest fires, damages our air and water, and hinders our children’s education all the way from kindergarten to their chances of getting an internship.   The entire family – children, working parents, and seniors – will be hit, and it’s going to hurt them.

I am a college educated, tax paying, productive member of society...but sometimes, even when you plan ahead, life throws you a curveball and you find yourself in unpreventable circumstances.

I am a self-employed writer, who had been buying insurance on the individual market for 30 years. As I aged I saw my insurance premiums go up and up until they became the single biggest expense in my budget. Then I saw my income drop by 60% during the financial crisis.  When at the age of 64, I was informed that my premium would go up another 25%, I simply couldn't afford it. At that time my husband and I had begun helping our adult son, who is an opioid addict in recovery, to pay for his methadone program and for community college because he was making good progress on rebuilding his life. Because I was healthy and we couldn't absorb the insurance increase, I decided to take the risk of going without insurance for the first time in my life.   Then the ACA ""Covered California Exchange"" came into being and I was able to get a Kaiser Permanente Plan with a tax-credit subsidy that bridged me to Medicare. I didn't get sick or suffer an injury in that year, so my story isn't a dramatic one that makes powerful telling in a hearing or a protest. But fortune could so easily have gone the other way. Thanks to ACA, I remained covered with a plan I could afford, we were able to help our son in recovery, and we had peace of mind.” - Nancy, Elk Grove  I’m sharing health care stories from Sacramento County families to highlight how repeal would harm real people.

After serving his country in the Air Force for more than 22 years on Active Duty and for 10 years in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, Virgilio was ready for a well-deserved retirement in Elk Grove.  But for two years, Virgilio did not receive the disability benefits he’d been promised by the Department of Veterans Affairs. For two years, he contacted the VA repeatedly and was told to wait while his bills continued to pile up.  That’s when he contacted my office for help. With our help, he began receiving his benefits within a few weeks -- including the tens of thousands of dollars in benefits that he was owed. It was the least my staff and I could do after Virgilio’s service to our country.

Sal was diagnosed with prostate cancer related to his exposure to Agent Orange. He decided to use his Department of Veterans Affairs benefits to pay for his medicine and started responding positively to treatment.  Unfortunately, Sal later received tests that his cancer had returned. It was a very stressful time for Sal and his finances. During this second treatment period, the VA had not yet provided Sal with his back-pay benefits, adding to his stress. As the bills mounted, Sal contacted my office to help with his VA disability claim – we got right to work.  It turned out that while Sal was approved for his back-pay, the VA had never actually sent his benefits. My office contacted the VA about  expediting Sal’s benefits and the situation was resolved within a month.

After raising a family, they put their dreams of retirement on hold to help support their granddaughters. But soon, their Medicare supplemental insurance was canceled – through no fault of their own – and threatened to place all of their hard work and financial security in danger.  Rob and his wife paid for a private insurance plan to supplement their Medicare health coverage. But Rob began to receive notices from his insurance company claiming that he owed them money, even though he had setup automatic payments from his bank account. He called his insurance agent repeatedly, and was assured that he had paid in full.  But then Rob and his wife received a cancellation notice. It turned out that his insurance company was checking the wrong account all along, and that his automatic payments had been turned off.   They were told their insurance policy could not be reinstated, and that they would have to wait for the next open enrollment period to get their coverage back – several months away. Rob and his wife were worried that they would have to pay for their medications and other health care needs with credit cards, piling up debts that would place their whole retirement in jeopardy.  Then Rob called my office, and my staff got to work. Within a few weeks, we were able to help Rob and his wife get a Medicare exemption so their policy could be reinstated.  Rob asked my office that when we shared his story, that we share his advice: “Don’t be afraid to call your representative for help – Stick to the facts and they will do everything they can.”  If you think you may need help, please call my office at (916) 635-0505 or visit bera.house.gov/gethelp to learn more. We’ve helped return more than $4.5 million in owed benefits to local taxpayers and we’d be honored to help you, too.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAmiBera/photos/a.537648192914949.124183.528662157146886/1722285137784576/?type=3",NA,78,9,10,10,0,1,0,0
