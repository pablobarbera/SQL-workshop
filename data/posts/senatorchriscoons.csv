I have served alongside Senator Sessions for six years, and during that time, we have worked together constructively on several criminal justice issues, including support for local law enforcement, reauthorization of the Victims of Child Abuse Act and restoration of funding to the Federal Public Defender Service.  On many more issues, however, including several that are core to my view of justice, Senator Sessions has vigorously opposed bipartisan reform efforts.   Any President deserves some latitude in picking nominees who support their principles, but on many important issues, including voting rights, civil rights, sentencing reform, LGBT rights, domestic violence protections, immigration reform, religious freedom, civil liberties, and torture, Senator Sessions has actively opposed bipartisan efforts to advance justice.  While I believe Senator Sessions will uphold the law, even those he disagrees with, the role of Attorney General is bigger than that.  I am concerned that Senator Sessions’ record as a prosecutor and an elected official demonstrates that on too many occasions he did not take action when there was an opportunity to stand up for the vulnerable, promote civil rights, or advance justice.    Today, the battle for equality continues in America, and our Attorney General cannot simply watch the march of history pass him by.  After carefully reviewing and considering his 30 years of public service, I do not believe that Sen. Sessions has taken sufficient action to demonstrate his commitment to lead the Department of Justice’s important work for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,960,209,90,100,1,6,1,20

Today, I joined the ""Natural Security Podcast"" with Johan Bergenas to discuss this legislation and how to balance encouraging human development while protecting local ecosystems.

This is not a states’ rights issue — it is a civil rights issue that affects students in every state across the country. It has long been settled that states must comply with federal civil rights laws, even when they disagree with particular applications of those laws. It is our obligation to protect the equal rights of American citizens, and President Trump’s withdrawal of guidance does not advance states’ rights – it legitimizes hate and discrimination. Fortunately, the Trump administration’s actions do not change our anti-discrimination laws under Title IX or the Constitution, which protect students of all gender identities. I am confident that these students’ rights will be vindicated in our courts, and I am proud to stand with them in this fight for justice.","status",NA,NA,556,85,59,42,0,0,19,5

However, the sectors that these emerging entrepreneurs need to break into often necessitate a helping hand from us here in Washington. That’s why in 2015 I was proud to support bipartisan tax legislation that made the research and development (R&D) tax credit permanent and expanded it to help more small businesses and startups access it. The proposal to expand the credit was drawn from the Innovators Job Creation Act, a bill that I led along with Senator Pat Roberts and Congressmen Mike Kelly and Ron Kind.  But now that our proposal is law, it is our responsibility to make sure that research intensive startups in Delaware and around the country know how to claim the R&D credit. That’s why I teamed up again with Senator Roberts and Congressmen Kelly and Kind to reintroduce the Support Small Business R&D Act. This legislation will help startups capitalize on tax credits provided to incentivize businesses to take on research and development intensive projects.Our bill will accomplish this by requiring the Small Business Administration and Internal Revenue Service to develop educational and training materials for entrepreneurs who invest in research and could be qualified for the R&D tax credit. I will continue to strive to make sure that our startups and small businesses have the tools they need to take advantage of the R&D tax credit and continue to invest in advanced research.  https://www.coons.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/coons-roberts-kelly-kind-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-help-startups-and-small-businesses-invest-in-research","status",NA,NA,44,4,3,0,0,0,0,0

While I’m encouraged that the Trump Administration has felt compelled to act forcefully in Syria against the Assad regime, I’m gravely concerned that the United States is engaging further militarily in Syria without a well-thought-out, comprehensive plan.  Frankly, the President’s actions today generate more questions than answers.   Chief among those questions is whether President Trump plans to work with Congress to address the ongoing crisis in Syria and to seek proper authorization for further use of military force.  I’ve called repeatedly on the Obama Administration and now the Trump Administration to stop Assad and end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, and in 2013, I voted to authorize former President Obama to use force to punish Assad for using chemical weapons against his own people.  Coordination and openness with Congress is more important than ever, and President Trump must seek an authorization for the use of military force from Congress, especially if this attack signals an intention to consider launching a campaign against Assad.   President Trump has steadily increased the number of American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria engaged in the fight against ISIS.  This strike against Syria further complicates our engagement there.  Those troops, their families, and the American people deserve to know our plan for conducting, paying for, and concluding our involvement in this volatile region.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/politics/donald-trump-syria-military/index.html","cnn.com",237,93,87,3,0,4,29,18

A son of immigrants, Gene’s own improbable story of success in business and life began through a scholarship opportunity that allowed him to go to Swarthmore College, a gift he later paid forward many times over. With a sharp mind, a striking wit, and a tireless work ethic, Gene built a successful business licensing inventions and technology around the world before turning to his true calling: making a difference in the lives of others.    Gene’s extraordinary promise of a college scholarship to an entire class of middle school students from Harlem in 1981 was the stuff of legend. Gene went on to build the ‘I Have a Dream’ Foundation, a nationwide network of more than a hundred local chapters. The power of his vision and his passion for giving kids from tough schools and hard neighborhoods a genuine chance in life was infectious. My own life was changed by Gene from the moment I first met him in 1988. He inspired me to launch an ‘I Have a Dream’ Foundation chapter in my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and I later worked for Gene at the organization’s national office in New York and served on the national board for a decade.

Ania was born in a Soviet labor camp in 1942, where she faced severe conditions, including little food and sub-zero temperatures. Her mother, a lawyer, was the only woman in the camp, and her father, a physician, would barter medical care for food. It wasn’t until 1946 that the family was allowed to return to Poland. From there, Mrs. Drimer eventually moved to the United States to marry Marcel and work as a pharmacist.   Marcel was born in a small Polish town in May 1934. After the German Army invaded the territory in the summer of 1941, his family was forced into the Drohobycz ghetto. Before the ghetto was liquidated, his father bribed a guard so the family could escape the killing centers. A Ukrainian family hid them until they were liberated in August 1944. Malnourishment deprived Mr. Drimer of the use of his legs, but after relearning how to walk, he graduated from an engineering college and moved to the United States. Today, both Ania and Marcel volunteer regularly at the Holocaust Museum.   As we remember the horrors of the Holocaust and shine a light on the selfless acts countless individuals made to protect the lives of their Jewish neighbors, we must recommit: never again.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatorchriscoons/photos/a.268939346452679.76007.254950754518205/1566562286690372/?type=3",NA,77,4,5,1,0,0,0,0

(For proof of that, look no further than what's going on in the Senate this week.) Many folks are despairing about our ability to hear each other, to work together, and to tackle the problems facing our country. But I have an optimistic prediction: one of the unexpected outcomes of President Trump's administration will be to make the Senate great again. That optimism stems, in part, from what I witness and participate in each Wednesday morning at the Senate Prayer Breakfast. It's when two-dozen senators--conservative and Evangelical, Mormon and Protestant, Jewish and even Buddhist--gather together for an hour. We do two things that don't exist in the rest of our weeks: we trust each other, and we listen. That hour helps me build bipartisan relationships that have led to real legislative progress in the Senate, and I think there's a lesson for progressives in that: we need to realize that progressive values aren't just secular values. Whether it's fighting climate change or welcoming refugees, at the end of the day, we have to make clear that we fight for things like civil rights, social justice, and the environment not in spite of our faith but because of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWfJ9qO3A10","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWfJ9qO3A10",NA,210,41,25,22,1,1,0,3

The revised bill is not an improvement, but another huge step backwards from the health care system that we already have in place.   Most notably, this bill includes a proposal from Senator Cruz that would allow insurers to offer junk health insurance plans. To me, that is like allowing car companies to sell cars without airbags, bumpers, or emergency brakes.  It might make the cars cheaper, but the cars are too dangerous to drive.  This misguided amendment will cause risk pools to deteriorate and insurers across the country have already expressed their strong opposition.    Additionally, this bill still incudes dramatic cuts to Medicaid, a critical program relied on by over 220,000 children, low-income individuals, individuals with disabilities, and seniors in Delaware.   Republicans and Democrats must work together to improve the Affordable Care Act in ways that would give Americans more accessible, affordable, high-quality health care.  The Republicans’ revised bill would only do the opposite. I call on my Republican colleagues to abandon their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act; Democrats are ready and willing to work across the aisle to fix our health care system.","status",NA,NA,430,187,92,12,0,6,44,90

However, if we really want to support and grow American manufacturing we need more than theme weeks and slogans; we need new ideas, new policies, and real leadership from the White House.   In the first seven months of the Trump Administration, the manufacturing rhetoric from the White House simply has not been matched with real action.  For example, President Trump’s proposed budget eliminated the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, one of the most important and effective federal manufacturing programs, and guts the Manufacturing USA program, which is critical to supporting manufacturing innovation.   I’m still more than willing to work with President Trump and my colleagues in Congress to support ‘Made in America’ policies.  I have championed a number of bipartisan, pro-manufacturing bills, including a permanent extension of the R&D tax credit and the Defend Trade Secrets Act, which creates new federal protections for intellectual property. Just last month, I introduced the Invent and Manufacture in America Act with Senator Roberts (R-KS), which increases the R&D tax credit for companies that not only design in America but make it in America.  I would love to work with the President to pass this ‘Made in America’ bill into law, but to do that, we need him to act, not just talk.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/16/white-house-unveils-made-in-america-week-though-many-trump-products-are-made-overseas/?utm_term=.03837378ca1f","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/16/white-house-unveils-made-in-america-week-though-many-trump-products-are-made-overseas/?utm_term=.03837378ca1f","washingtonpost.com",158,90,34,11,6,5,1,17

I am praying for his full recovery and for the return of his forceful voice to the Senate.   Last month, I had the honor of traveling again with John McCain, this time to Vietnam and Singapore. We visited the site where his plane was shot down and the prison where he was a POW. Throughout our visit, I saw his humor and grace in recounting this very hard history, and in many meetings with senior Vietnamese officials, I saw the very high regard in which he is held throughout the country for his amazing work over 22 visits to Vietnam to reconcile our countries. We also visited the USS John McCain, named for his father and grandfather, in Cam Ranh Bay, where he spoke to the crew and presided over an inspiring re-enlistment and promotion ceremony. Finally, we visited Singapore for a regional security conference, where I heard across many meetings the deep respect for his leadership by many allies and adversaries alike across the region.

Tom Carper (D-Del.) and I sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price questioning plans by HHS to unilaterally shorten the duration of grant agreements for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program. Since 2015, the TPP Program has served nearly 1.2 million youth in 40 states and territories (including Delaware), supporting teens in adopting sexual health behaviors that help them avoid unintended pregnancy. Abruptly ending funding for the TPP Program puts at risk the health and well-being of women and our most vulnerable youth who depend on the evidenced-based work that TPP Program grantees are doing across the nation. This move also undermines bipartisan goals on evidenced-based policymaking.

In Burma, the country’s leaders have worked to advance peace after a historic 2015 election. However, as they try to achieve that broader peace, they must protect Internally Displaced Persons and find a path to citizenship for the Rohingya – a group that’s been denied citizenship since 1982, and has been suffering an unbelievable number of human rights violations at the hands of Burmese security forces. Since October 2016, over 70,000 people have fled Burma for Bangladesh.

Waves of change, including the Maker Movement, 3D printing, accessible computer aided engineering tools, new knowledge-sharing platforms, and networked operational technology, are transforming the manufacturing sector. Across the country, manufacturing still provides more than 12 million Americans with high-paying work – and it’s still the largest single sector of the U.S. economy, at 11% of GDP. A consortium like MForesight provides critical insights on some of the challenges we face in technology and manufacturing.

Today, that bill passed out of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. This bill will help startups and small businesses take advantage of research and development (R&D) tax credits by providing the tools and information necessary to learn how to claim them. Specifically, the bill would require the Small Business Administration and Internal Revenue Service to partner to develop educational and training materials for entrepreneurs who invest in research and could be eligible to use the R&D credit to offset their expenses. These tax credits allow small businesses to invest in advanced research, which in turn creates jobs, produces new technologies and grows the economy, but only if entrepreneurs understand how to take advantage of them. I am proud to work with Senator Roberts to make sure that our startups and small businesses have the tools they need to take advantage of the R&D credit and continue to invest in innovation.  https://www.coons.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-coons-bill-to-help-startups-and-small-businesses-invest-in-research-passes-committee","link","https://www.coons.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-coons-bill-to-help-startups-and-small-businesses-invest-in-research-passes-committee","coons.senate.gov",46,8,3,1,1,0,0,0

It conclusively reaffirmed that humans are contributing to climate change - and are already feeling its effects. “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change,” they wrote. President Trump and his administration continue to deny the human impact on climate change, and this year announced that the US would be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Since 2012, DACA has allowed immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children to defer removal and apply for work visas.  DACA has helped over 750,000 DREAMers work, study and contribute to our society free of the constant fear of being forced to leave the only home they have ever known. Those who come to our country as children, without authorization but through no fault of their own, deserve the opportunity to live their lives out of the shadows. Not only will ending DACA hurt the thousands of immigrant families whose loved ones may be forced to leave the United States, but I believe our federal immigration enforcement resources are much better focused on those who are actively a threat to our community.  DREAMers are overwhelmingly hard working and tax paying, many have served in our armed forces or graduated near the top of their schools and should be allowed to continue to contribute to our nation. President Trump has gone back on his promise to 'treat DACA with heart,' and Congress now has the urgent responsibility to fix our broken immigration system in a bipartisan way that protects DREAMers.  I was proud to be an active part of the legislative process that delivered bipartisan immigration reform that passed the Senate in 2013, and I intend to work hard to do so again. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/trump-daca-dreamers-immigration.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&smtyp=cur","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/trump-daca-dreamers-immigration.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&smtyp=cur","nytimes.com",490,301,63,16,2,4,117,106

I have said for years that the ACA isn’t perfect, and I’m excited to see my colleagues working across the aisle to find solutions for some of the legislation’s most pressing issues. As senators on the committee hear testimony from governors, insurance commissioners, and other health care stakeholders, I hope they can begin to find a path toward stabilizing premiums in the individual insurance market, expanding coverage, and lowering health care costs. I believe these hearings will provide the opportunity for lawmakers to take a broader look at what’s driving up health care costs in the United States. Crafting a health care system that works for all Americans is no easy task. But the ACA provides a solid foundation from which Republicans and Democrats should be able to find common ground, and these hearings are a platform for debating and passing health care legislation that works for us all.

As you read this, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) are courting votes to pass a bill that would strip health care coverage from millions of Americans, raise costs on insurance coverage, and change the landscape of American insurance without the support of a single Democrat. In Delaware, the Graham-Cassidy bill would cut federal funding for health coverage by $1.2 billion in 2027 alone. The American people have been very clear on this issue- they do not want to repeal the ACA, and that’s why it is still the law of the land.   What I hear time and again from Delawareans is that they want us to work TOGETHER to improve the Affordable Care Act.

The president has taken an important first step that temporarily makes it easier to ship aid and supplies to Puerto Rico, and we’re glad Congress has approved a first installment of disaster assistance, but there’s much more work to be done.   “The Delaware National Guard has deployed troops and flown two dozen relief missions, but we are ready and willing to do more. We have more guard units specialized in communications, engineering, aviation, security, medical, and heavy truck driving that are ready and eager to assist the emergency response efforts.   ""We are committed to doing everything in our power to help, but the Trump Administration has the critical responsibility of taking the lead and activating the full force of the federal government to help these people.

President Trump’s rule threatens the guarantee of contraceptive coverage for the 62 million women across the country currently covered by allowing for-profit employers to end coverage of birth control for their employers to end coverage of birth control for their employees based on a religious or moral objection without requiring a way for women to get that coverage. A woman’s choice in birth control should be between her and her doctor, and the religious beliefs of the woman’s boss should have no role in it. This is another attempt at discrimination against women, particularly those who lack the financial means to pay for contraceptive care out of pocket. A woman’s boss should not be allowed to decide which forms of birth control and other health services she can access and I’m proud to support legislation that would prevent them from doing so. http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/356202-dems-release-bill-to-block-trump-birth-control-rule","link","http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/356202-dems-release-bill-to-block-trump-birth-control-rule","thehill.com",445,120,33,60,1,1,2,12

Taxing these waivers will make graduate school unaffordable for many promising American students! I've heard from several graduate students in Delaware about how these waivers allow them to attend school and, if these waivers were taxed, they would be forced to leave. We should be helping these students who are our future inventors, leaders, and entrepreneurs. But, don't just take it from me, take it from these UD graduate students who rely on this exemption:   “My husband and I are both in the PhD program here at UD, I am on a fellowship, he is a research assistant. We have both served as teaching assistants and research assistants in our time here. Each of us has a stipend of ~$20k, which seems like a lot, but housing in Newark is expensive and we have a 3-year-old whose dependent health insurance premiums are now over $3500 each year. When you add up the cost of living alone, plus PART-TIME daycare (3 half days a week so I can actually get a little work done), we have less than $750 a month left to eat, buy diapers, feed the dog, pay for emergencies, etc. This still seems like a lot, but it goes fast. AND because we don't get paid over the summer, I am expected to squirrel away enough money for us to live over the summer when we aren't on contract, too?! We break even at tax time every year - we always end up having to pay the state of Delaware, but our federal return usually is just enough to cover it. Grad school is hard. Grad school for two, with a kid, is even more difficult. Even a tiny increase in our taxable income would create not only financial pressure, but mental and emotional stress that myself, and many other grad students, would not be able to handle. I'm lucky, I think I will finish before this tax plan would go into effect, but what about all the other grad students in the exact same situation who would honestly have to choose between finishing a PhD and feeding their kid?! It's infuriating.” – J.H., University of Delaware   “I chose the Physical Ocean Science and Engineering PhD program and the University of Delaware because I felt the need to help stop climate change and be a part of the movement towards renewable energy, but this tax bill could force me to leave school. My personal stipend is $27,900. The proposed tax on our tuition waivers would end up costing me personally around an addition $6,000 in taxes a year, which will be more than 20% of my actual income. Most graduate students already work for close to minimum wage; this proposed burden to our finances will make graduate school only attainable for the independently wealthy. If this tax reform goes through, I believe many people will stop entering graduate school which will equate to a breakdown in the higher education system. With no students to do graduate work, professors’ research work will greatly slow, and without students graduating, the supply of qualified people for jobs requiring higher education will diminish. I personally do not know if I’ll be able to afford graduate school if this tax bill goes through. I’ve been financially independent from my parents for 4 years, so I if I suddenly cannot afford to pay rent and buy groceries I’m not sure what I'll be able to do, other than to abandon my goal of getting an advanced degree"" - Gwendolyn, University of Delaware   “I'm a PhD candidate in the Materials Science and Engineering department at the University of Delaware and my current stipend is close to $30,000/year. My tuition the first two years of graduate school was close to $28,000/year. My combined federal and state income taxes would jump from $3,530/year to $10,188/year, a ridiculous tax amount for income that I do not even make. My income before taxes would be the same in each case: $30,000/year. But my income after taxes would be $6,658/year less under this new plan. Unless I'm misunderstanding the bill, this makes no sense to me. This additional tax burden would severely degrade the quality of graduate research by reducing the number of qualified students and increasing the financial stress--and likely affecting the mental health--of students who choose to follow this career path, especially in the first two years when waived tuition is the highest.” - Eric Chen, University of Delaware   “I'm a PhD student in Water Science and Policy and I just moved out to Delaware with my partner from New Mexico. He teaches as an adjunct at UD and at DTCC, so he doesn't receive benefits. Paying for his health insurance, our apartment, any remaining tuition fees, and all of our other expenses means that we basically break even every month. He's also applying to a PhD program starting in Fall 2018. If we were both students and had to pay additional taxes on the tuition that the University isn't charging us, we wouldn't be able to afford to be here. We've both been in debt to colleges before and have agreed that we won't do so again, especially not in graduate school. Going for a PhD means sacrificing valuable work experience for higher education and the advancement of knowledge. We already donate much of our time to our classes or working as TAs or RAs. Asking us to go pay taxes as if we were middle-income earners working 40 hour a week jobs is less than fair and would represent a dark time for graduate education in this country"" - Aaron Russell, University of Delaware  #SaveGradEd","status",NA,NA,406,184,128,7,7,5,61,87

Last week, I joined more than a dozen Democratic Senators to ask our Republican colleagues to slow this process down and work together.   Finally, over the last few days, I've been working with a handful of my Republican and Democratic colleagues to try to find a way - any way - to stop this backroom, partisan process and force both parties to work together on tax reform. We got close to an agreement, but ultimately didn't succeed.   The bill that appears likely to pass the Senate soon is a bad one. There's no sugar coating it. This bill gives away tens of billions in corporate tax cuts with no strings attached, hurts the middle class over the long run, guts the Affordable Care Act, and adds more than $1 trillion to the national debt. It was written with no meaningful consultation between the two parties, and it is highly unpopular with the American public.    This process isn't finished yet, as the Senate and House bills remain very different, but I am very concerned that we're close to making our already-broken tax code even worse. As always, I remain willing to work across the aisle to pass a real, bipartisan tax reform bill for the middle class, but our opportunity to do that is quickly slipping away.","status",NA,NA,328,199,72,3,7,4,122,122

In moving this bill forward, we have failed in our must fundamental call to hear each other, to work together, and to be mindful that we do not cause harm to those in our society who look to us to make the future brighter, to open the doors of opportunity wider, and to listen to some of the most ancient and profound voices in the traditions that laid the foundation of this free society: that we legislate worst when we legislate against the least of our brethren.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorchriscoons/videos/1815437511802847/",NA,364,158,85,38,8,3,23,6

The story of Hanukkah is a story of faith, resilience and triumph in the face of impossible odds. These timeless lessons have given the Jewish people strength, perseverance and hope for centuries and continue to inspire Delawareans of all faiths.   I hope over the next eight nights you’ll have the opportunity to gather around the Menorah with friends, family and loved ones to celebrate the spirit of the season.  From my family to yours, Happy Hanukkah.","status",NA,NA,138,8,3,6,0,0,0,0

Today in the Senate, we passed the important Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, which makes it a federal crime to seriously harm or kill an animal as part of interstate commerce. Penalties would include fines and up to seven years in prison. If enacted into law, the PACT Act would be the first-ever federal law to grant all animals federal protections against cruelty and abuse. I heard from hundreds of my constituents about this issue, and I eagerly joined them in working to help end animal cruelty.","status",NA,NA,474,118,104,108,0,1,0,6

I worked hard across the aisle to propose alternative paths to lead us to what the president campaigned on: a middle-class tax cut.   Unfortunately, that’s not what this is. Instead, this tax bill is a huge giveaway to the very wealthiest Americans and the most profitable corporations, and it’s going to be paid for by the American middle class. My Republican colleagues have already said their next plan is to cut Medicare and Medicaid.  I joined Wolf Blitzer last night to discuss this.
