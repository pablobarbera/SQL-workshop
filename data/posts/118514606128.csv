On April 12, 1945, only hours after the death of FDR, Harry S. Truman was inaugurated President of the United States in the Cabinet Room of the White House.   With World War II still raging across Europe and the Pacific, Truman was abruptly called to lead the country through one of the most pivotal moments of its history. And the Missouri native was sworn in with none of the pageantry or fanfare we see today - there was simply no time for that.  With the weight of the world on his shoulders, Truman asked the recently-widowed Mrs. Roosevelt, ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" Famously, she replied, ""Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSamGraves/photos/a.10150095243931129.273722.118514606128/10154194482206129/?type=3",NA,148,16,28,4,1,0,0,1

A day that the country is reminded - as we should be each day - that God has given value and purpose to each and every human life.   It is estimated that there are more than 900,000 abortions performed in the United States every year. That's nearly a million lost chances at happiness, fulfillment, and life. It's exactly what Mother Teresa talked about when she called abortion ""the greatest destroyer of peace"" in the world.  And with all the changes I expect to see under President Trump, the fact that we finally again have a pro-life ally in the White House is the one that gives me the most hope.   On Tuesday, I helped pass H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act of 2017, through the House of Representatives. The bipartisan bill creates a permanent, government-wide prohibition against using federal dollars to fund abortions.   Additionally, in the coming days I’m helping to address a few other pieces of legislation that will help advance the pro-life cause.  The first is the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2017. In the last reported year alone, Planned Parenthood performed over 323,000 abortions and received over $550 million dollars in taxpayer funding – all according to their own math. Our bill will make sure that stops.  The second is the Conscience Protection Act, which prevents any federal, state, or local government from penalizing a health care provider that chooses not to offer or perform abortions.   In the 115th Congress, with a pro-life administration, Senate, and House of Representatives all united in the cause to protect the unborn, we have an opportunity to make real, tangible differences in the lives of the most vulnerable members of this country. And I pledge to do whatever I can to make that happen.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSamGraves/photos/a.10150095243931129.273722.118514606128/10154220465536129/?type=3",NA,101,46,27,14,0,2,2,17

Preferred by hunters everywhere, lead-based ammo is one of the cheapest and most accessible options out there. Additionally, every sportsman knows that public lands are some of the safest, most affordable places for us to hunt and fish across this country.  Blocking public lands to only those who can afford non lead-based ammunition drives up the cost to hunt, and it ultimately restricts the ability for law-abiding Americans to safely and freely exercise their Second Amendment rights. This is just another example of anti-gun liberals using creative, round-about ways to keep guns out of the hands of everyday Americans.  I recently joined about 60 of my Congressional colleagues in asking President Trump to reverse this misguided decision. It's good to be rid of one of the most anti-gun presidential administrations in history. I look forward to seeing the benefits of that, starting with a reversal of FWS' ban on lead-based ammo.","link","http://www.guns.com/2017/01/23/obama-usfws-director-moves-to-ban-lead-ammo-use/","guns.com",102,100,39,3,0,2,2,42

Here's a copy of a letter I sent to President Trump last week, asking him to undo the damage done by Obama's EPA.   Namely, Obama's EPA tried to take control of private ponds and streams, and it wrote anti-coal regulations that threatened to shut down power plants across the country.   With that rule, even the Supreme Court determined that the EPA ""unreasonably"" failed to consider the costs to everyday Americans.  This planet is God's gift to us, and how we steward it is our gift back. But we need people at the EPA who understand how rural America works. And we need people who understand that we need balance here.

I was still in my first year of Congress when we were attacked that day, and I remember so many of the details like it was yesterday.   ...  I woke up early that day and took a walk around the Capitol. Like so many others do, I remember that clear sky and the first feeling of fall in the air like it was yesterday.  I was showering down at the gym when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. I was huddled around the TV with a group of people when the second one crashed into the South Tower.  Then, back in my office, I heard an explosion and felt the ground shake underneath me. I knew right away what it was.  There was so much confusion in the minutes that followed. That’s what I remember most about the day. No one knew where to go or what to do. We were getting different instructions from different people. Then I watched the Speaker being physically pulled off the House floor. It was surreal.  For a place that is usually structured, everything was so chaotic and uncertain for a few minutes.  Those were some of the longest minutes of my life. We didn’t know if we were still under attack or where the safest place to be was. What made it even worse was the fact that cell phone lines were tied up and I couldn’t talk to my family back in Tarkio. I didn't get home to them until airports were reopened later that week.  It’s hard to believe that was 15 years ago. It’s one of those things that in some ways feels like last week, and in others seems like a lifetime ago.  We have made progress in the War on Terror in the years since. But that war is far from over. What is clear is that victory against ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will require American strength, leadership, and ingenuity.   Our way of life is still the target of this extremism. We cannot take a back seat and allow someone else to defeat it.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSamGraves/photos/a.10150095243931129.273722.118514606128/10154840415211129/?type=3",NA,130,10,10,2,0,0,18,1
