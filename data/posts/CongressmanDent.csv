Congress and the current administration have a responsibility to foster the special relationship between the US and the UK, which has been built on shared history and values, a common language, and mutual trust.  The UK serves as one of the largest markets for US exports and the largest supplier of US imports. Additionally, over 900,000 American jobs are reliant on trade with British companies.

Payne Jr. and Congressman Leonard Lance, I re-introduced #HR1017, the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act, which will make colorectal cancer screenings for seniors more accessible and affordable.  Under current law, seniors covered by Medicare aren't charged coinsurance for a screening colonoscopy. However, if the attending physician discovers a polyp and removes it (which is standard procedure), Medicare considers the procedure a ""treatment"" rather than a ""screening."" As a result, seniors are held responsible for covering the coinsurance, which can be anywhere from $100 to $300.  This bill would waive Medicare's cost-sharing requirement for screening colonoscopies, even if a polyp or tissue is removed. Colonoscopies are life-saving screening procedures, and we want to encourage more people to get them, not deter them because of high insurance costs.  This bill also has the support of Fight Colorectal Cancer and American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network - ACS CAN.","status",NA,NA,113,35,9,5,0,0,0,2

I was honored to join my colleague Rep. Paul D. Tonko in receiving the inaugural Heritage Champion Award.  NHAs are Congressionally recognized regions or areas that tell a nationally significant story representing our country's heritage. NHAs are operated by local organizations, and although they receive technical assistance from the National Park Service (NPS), they are not federally owned nor are they part of the NPS. Instead, NHAs help to tell the stories of local history in a national context, and advance economic, cultural, historic, environmental, and community development.  #PA15 is a part of both the Schuylkill River Heritage Area (which is home to Western Berks and the East Penn Valley in Berks County) and the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor (which is home to the Ironton Rail-Trail, the Walnutport Canal & Locktenders House, and more). These NHAs showcase the natural beauty and history of #PA15, and it is important that these sites remain available for current and future generations. That's why I recently introduced the National Heritage Area Act. This important legislation would authorize a National Heritage Area System to better coordinate the establishment and management of NHAs across the country.

The Affordable Care Act, which I voted against 7 years ago, has failed to live up to the promises of the previous Administration. Too many Americans have seen their health care costs rise, insurers are fleeing the marketplace, and businesses are struggling under the increased costs and regulations. In Pennsylvania the average 2017 premium increase for all individual market plans was 32%, and 68% of counties have only one or two insurers offering plans on the exchange. Clearly something must be done.  Over the past few weeks, I have diligently reviewed the American Health Care Act and recently proposed Amendments. I have spoken with constituents, leaders in the health care patient and provider community, Republican and Democrat Governors, Senators, the President and many others. After careful deliberation, I cannot support the bill and will oppose it. I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurances unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low-to-moderate income and older individuals. We have an important opportunity to enact reforms that will result in real health care transformation--bringing down costs and improving health outcomes. This legislation misses the mark.

The President must provide a much clearer explanation as to the timing and rationale for this action. Additionally, more information is needed about how the Director's firing will impact the investigations by the FBI and both branches of Congress.","status",NA,NA,1068,363,120,75,2,3,1,28

In order to qualify, applicants must be U.S. citizens and either an undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate student.

Passing these bills through the committee is a great first step in the Appropriations process, and I look forward to continuing to work with my fellow committee members to pass the remaining bills.  ✔️ This week the House also passed three bills (#HR2664, #HR2480, #HR2200) that strengthen our efforts in combating human trafficking, domestically and internationally. Recognizing the warning signs of a trafficking situation is crucial to being able to report it to law enforcement. These bills not only provide additional federal grants for combating trafficking, but they also help establish training for Department of Labor personnel to better detect trafficking. Finally, these bills also prevent the U.S. military, police, or other security forces from partnering with foreign governments that are complicit in trafficking operations.  ✔️ Today, I joined my colleagues in voting for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which gives our troops the largest pay raise in eight years. Additionally, the FY18 NDAA bill focuses on expanding our military forces, enhancing troop readiness, and meeting the maintenance needs of all service branches. Finally, in response to the Marine photo sharing scandal that broke earlier this year, this bill updates the Uniform Code of Military Justice to protect the privacy of service members from unwanted and unauthorized sharing of intimate images.","link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdPC14vNH0E","youtube.com",51,41,7,7,0,0,0,3

As if all of that isn't impressive enough, the Smithsonian Design Museum included both of Radius' original toothbrushes into its permanent design hall of fame. #PA15Proud","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repcharliedent/photos/a.436422297533.228389.69862092533/10155413854892534/?type=3",NA,79,5,8,1,0,1,0,0

Brooks (IN-05). This bill will help equip local law enforcement agencies to address mental health challenges faced by officers. The men and women who serve in law enforcement professions endure high levels of stress as a result of the work they do. It's crucial that we provide resources that will allow them to continue to serve our communities in prime physical and mental health, and I believe this bill is a solid step toward that goal.","status",NA,NA,92,20,4,6,0,0,0,0

The VIC will serve as proof of military service and may be used to obtain promotion discounts or other veteran services (where offered) in lieu of the standard DD-214 form. It will also serve as a more portable and secure alternative for those who served the minimum obligated time in service, but did not meet the retirement or medical discharge threshold. In order to request a VIC, veterans must have:  ✔️ Honorable service record in the armed forces (and reserve components)  ✔️ Honorable or general discharge  Visit the link below to begin the application process. Applicants should receive their VIC within 60 days.","link","https://vets.gov/veteran-id-card/","vets.gov",50,29,36,5,0,1,0,0

America's shining beacon of freedom faced being extinguished during the attack that claimed 2,400 marine, sailor, soldier, and civilian lives, and the ensuing years of WWII. Yet, the attack was closely followed by an emphatic demonstration of America's unwavering resilience in the face of despair and destruction.  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt rallied a nation when he was tasked with consoling the rest of the country the following day. ""Hostilities exist,"" he claimed. ""there is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger."" But he continued by assuring, ""With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph - so help us God.""  As we recognize the Pearl Harbor attack's 76th anniversary, let us never forget the ultimate price many in the Greatest Generation paid on this date. Further, may we always remain grateful for the safety and security that the men and women in our armed forces work to provide us daily.","status",NA,NA,55,32,6,0,0,0,4,1
