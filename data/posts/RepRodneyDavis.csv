Since coming to Congress, my focus has always been on making Washington work for those I represent. We’ve had some successes but I am confident that under this new unified Republican government, we will have many more. I look forward to hitting the ground running by first addressing the government overregulation that has created this part-time economy and hindered the American Dream for too many. This includes repealing and replacing Obamacare, which has left millions of Americans with healthcare costs they cannot afford. The American people sent us to Washington demanding leadership and now they expect action.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/photos/a.323633394409546.63923.323631667743052/1035764783196400/?type=3",NA,545,78,8,24,0,0,2,1

The building was purchased by Mannie Jackson, an Edwardsville High School and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  alumnus, renovated, and reopened as a center for humanities through Lewis and Clark Community College. Its mission is to help individuals and communities across the globe embrace the notion of respect, understanding, kindness, and forgiveness.","link","http://www.mjchf.org/","mjchf.org",14,8,1,0,0,0,0,0

This is troubling not just for graduates but for our economy and debt. Graduates with large amounts of student debt are less likely to buy a house, purchase a car, or save for retirement. This is a problem for our economy. Another issue are defaults. In 2012, roughly 1.3 million students graduated with student loan debt. 153,400 of those students have since defaulted on their loans leaving 4.5 billion in default liabilities. And that’s just one recent graduating class.  The good news is thought that more and more employers like the ones who spoke today and their clients are recognizing this burden on graduates and have started to offer help. Roughly three percent of private businesses provide some sort of student loan repayment assistance. H.R. 795 will help that number grow by offering tax incentives to businesses who provide the benefit and be tax-exempt for the employee so it’s not counted as part of their income.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/videos/1084451688327709/",NA,75,28,11,3,0,0,0,1

In my experience as the representative of one of the few evenly split districts in the country, that usually means you’re on the right track. Some, on both sides of the aisle, may not want to face the mess that Obamacare has created and what is required to clean it up, but we made a promise to the American people to responsibly fix our health care system and that’s what this bill does. I encourage you to read the bill at readthebill.gop yourself and these seven reasons why this is a responsible, conservative solution to repealing and replacing Obamacare.","link","https://medium.com/@RepRodneyDavis/seven-reasons-the-american-health-care-act-is-a-responsible-conservative-solution-to-repealing-and-ff5e3e5f1a14#.s36m2uyow","medium.com",35,132,8,2,6,0,0,38

I was proud to be part of the negotiations with President Trump and my colleagues that allowed this bill to address the concerns I have heard from many of my constituents over the years, issues expressed by hospitals, community health centers, and others, but health care is a complicated issue. It will take all of us willing to set politics aside and look beyond the next election to make it work for those struggling to pay their health care bill each month.  I’m disappointed in my Democrat colleagues in the House and Senate who refuse to be part of the discussion on fixing a law that many in their own party have said is not working. I have heard a lot of talk about the need to fix problems like 18 of the 23 Obamacare insurance co-ops failing, leaving millions without insurance, premium costs rising upwards of 55 percent in Illinois, and deductibles that leave people with insurance they can’t afford to use, but no solutions. When President Obama was in office, I reached across the aisle multiple times to author and support legislation to improve Obamacare but the fact is, this law is collapsing so now I expect my Democrat colleagues to do the same and work with us. They have a choice: either be part of the solution or watch as millions more lose their coverage and prices continue to increase for their constituents.  At the same time, I’m disappointed in many of my Republican colleagues for failing to support a good bill backed by President Trump and many others. I came here to govern and I’m disappointed that we came up short. I have always said I will do whatever necessary to fix our broken health care system and will continue to do that.","status",NA,NA,172,375,21,6,27,5,2,54

To me, this isn’t only a safety precaution but also just commonsense...  ""I did not introduce this legislation hastily. It was a product of many failed conversations with the airline industry urging them to implement this on their own because I generally believe too much regulation on private businesses doesn’t benefit the customer or the business.

I’m confident that both parties will come together once again to avert a government shutdown but crisis appropriating is not the way to govern. That's why I've introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act. This bill removes the threat of a shutdown. I want Congress to get back to our regular appropriations process and stop massive, year-end spending deals where the choice is vote for this bill or shut down the government.

Rodney Davis","2017-05-04","2017-05-04 18:51:31","Great news → the House just passed the American Health Care Act to repeal and replace Obamacare.   There has been a lot of misinformation out there so I encourage everyone to read my entire statement before commenting. My statement:   “Americans deserve a health care system that provides a choice of insurance they can actually afford. Many want to pretend Obamacare is working – that it has covered 24 million people or lowered premiums by an average of $2,500 like was promised but neither of those are true. The facts are Obamacare covered less than half of those it promised to cover, premiums in Illinois went up by an average of 45 to 55 percent last year, and 29 million still don’t have insurance coverage even though it’s mandated by the government. People would rather face a penalty than have Obamacare because they’ve seen the 31 million people who pay costly, monthly premiums for plans with sky-high deductibles that drive up out of pocket costs. Seventy-five percent of people in Illinois only have the choice of one or two insurance providers on the exchanges. That is not success.  “President Obama and Democrats in Congress had seven years to fix Obamacare through regulatory reforms, which did not need congressional approval, but failed because the law is fundamentally flawed. Obamacare is collapsing and we have a duty to our constituents to pass a solution. It’s incredibly disappointing that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle – many of whom have acknowledged the law’s failures – refuse to be part of a solution for their constituents who will likely get another notice at the end of the year telling them their premiums have increased yet again or the plan they have no longer exists.  “It’s unfortunate that many of the same groups selling the broken promises of Obamacare seven years ago are now spreading misinformation about the American Health Care Act (AHCA), particularly misinformation about pre-existing conditions. This is insulting to me as someone whose wife is an 18-year survivor of colon cancer – a specific form of colon cancer that is genetic and one I pray my children do not have. This bill does not weaken pre-existing conditions. The same protections currently mandated under Obamacare to prevent insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, remain. This bill goes a step further than Obamacare to help those with pre-existing conditions by including provisions that not just help people get insurance coverage, but insurance they can actually afford.  “We promised the American people we would do whatever necessary to fix our broken health care system and this bill is just the start. You will continue to see the House pass legislation that focuses on lowering costs and providing better options for all Americans.”","status",NA,NA,419,1391,174,42,1,2,25,1092

I appreciated all those who came to voice their opinions but it's important to get the facts straight. Here are the facts:  As a federal standard within the AHCA, no insurance company can drop you because of a pre-existing condition or raise your premiums because of it if you maintain continuous coverage.  Cost of health care on the Obamacare exchanges increased by an average of 45-55% last year.  The AHCA goes a step further to help those with pre-existing conditions and all Americans by taking steps to actually lower the cost of care.  29 million people do not have health insurance right now even though the government mandates it.  31 million can't afford to use the health insurance they have because of high deductibles. Many are paying costly premiums, while still being forced to pay high out-of-pocket costs.  Obamacare is collapsing. 75% of Illinois only has one or two options of insurance companies to choose from.  A monopoly increases costs.","video","https://www.facebook.com/OFASpringfield/videos/1295386327182218/",NA,100,88,0,0,8,0,0,25

In 1997, Medicaid spending was roughly $160 billion. Now it's closer to $600 billion and if Obamacare is left in place, spending is projected to grow to $835 billion in 2023. 1 in 4 people in Illinois are on Medicaid and 44% of the expansion population are males aged 19-34. Not only is this unsustainable, but it's overwhelming the system and making it more difficult for Medicaid to help the most vulnerable in our society, which is what it was intended to do. The House passed the American Health Care Act (AHCA) that will slow the growth of Medicaid spending, help more people afford private health insurance, and we are committed to further reforms that will increase group or employer-sponsored health care, which is the most common form of health insurance, to give them better, more affordable health coverage.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/photos/a.323633394409546.63923.323631667743052/1212911778815032/?type=3",NA,29,64,9,1,5,2,0,13

Our plan lowers rates and simplifies across the board but here are three major things we want to do for small businesses:   ✅Separates small business income – Small businesses will no longer be taxed under the individual side, which has rates as high as 44.6%. ✅Ends the “Death Tax” – Family farms and businesses will be able to be passed down to future generations without a large tax bill. ✅Repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax – Millions of Americans won’t have to calculate their taxes twice every year.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/photos/a.323633394409546.63923.323631667743052/1226171644155712/?type=3",NA,31,18,5,0,3,0,0,5

Our immigration system is broken and it cannot be fixed simply by circumventing Congress and legislating through the Executive Branch as attempted by the Obama administration. We need stronger border protections and enforcement measures, which the House has already started to address. However, part of this broken immigration system includes people who were brought here illegally as children through no fault of their own and for many of them, this is the only country they have ever known. President Obama said himself in 2012 that DACA was never meant to be a permanent fix. Now, President Trump has provided Congress with a timeline to address this issue and I hope together we can find a permanent, bipartisan solution that balances compassion and lawfulness.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/photos/a.323633394409546.63923.323631667743052/1271217816317761/?type=3",NA,26,19,3,0,1,0,0,3

Our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons… The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor them to make sure it keeps its commitments.’  “Today, we’ve seen the impact this deal has had. North Korea is estimated to have anywhere from 10 to 20 nuclear weapons and we’ve seen by recent aggressions their willingness to use them against the U.S.  “In 2015, the Obama Administration took the same naive approach, but this time, with the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. Concession after concession by the U.S. led to an unverifiable and unenforceable deal that gave Iran an influx of cash and other economic resources to put towards terrorism and their nuclear program.  “In response to bipartisan concerns about the deal, Congress passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act in 2015 by a vote of 400-25 to put further oversight over Iran and expedite Congress’ ability to restore sanctions if they do not comply.

Rodney Davis","2017-11-16","2017-11-16 01:18:24","Tonight, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee agreed to work to find a solution on tuition waivers as part of tax reform. This is important for graduate students and employees at the universities in my district. Last year, the University of Illinois provided $184 million in tuition waivers to 1,387 faculty and staff last year – 1,100 of those employees made less than $75,000. We want to protect the building services employee or administrative assistant who has worked the same job for 15 years just to send their kid to college can continue to do so without being taxed. I appreciate Chairman Brady's willingness to listen and work with us on this issue. This is how the process should work. Tomorrow, the House will consider the first major tax reform bill since 1986. I am looking forward to voting for a bill that will let middle-income earners keep more of what they earn by simplifying, lowering rates, and doubling the standard deduction to $12k for individuals and $24k for couples filing jointly.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/videos/1314359842003558/",NA,43,52,5,0,2,0,0,4

I'm glad Chairman Brady committed to working with us to fix tuition waivers when the bill goes to conference with the Senate and I look forward to voting for the first major tax relief bill since 1986.

No one should have to worry about sexual harassment when they come to work.   As a former staffer and someone with a female-led office, I believe this resolution is an important first step in addressing this problem as we work to increase professionalism in the House and establish a workplace that is grounded in respect.   In Congress, we’ve got to lead by example.   As a member of the House Administration Committee, we worked hard to pass reforms last Congress to make House office spending more transparent and accountable than any other area of the federal government and I am confident in this committee’s ability to address this important issue in a bipartisan way.   I look forward to the continued hearings the committee will have on this issue as we work to institute policies that protect staffers against sexual harassment and also ensure female staffers are provided leadership opportunities.   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/videos/1326209860818556/",NA,35,37,4,4,7,0,1,6

Are you happy with the state of the economy since the end of the Great Recession eight years ago? You shouldn’t be. First, discard the impact of the stock market boom fattening your 401(k) since Trump’s election, because that’s due in part to anticipation of tax reform. Kill tax reform and you lose market momentum.  ""What you’re left with is what this nation has had: growth around 2 percent or less a year. That’s not fast enough to boost stagnant wages, increase the job participation rate or improve U.S. competitiveness vs. other countries. Passing this tax reform should get the economy to steady 3 percent growth. At that rate, the country generates trillions of dollars of new economic activity, creates jobs and increases household income – money to be spent or saved.""","link","http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-tax-20171204-story.html","chicagotribune.com",24,79,6,2,8,2,0,32

I firmly believe the federal government should be there when states need help after a disaster and that’s why I’ve voted for every single disaster relief bill, but it’s time rural Illinois starts getting a fair shake as well.   Year after year, my constituents have been unfairly punished by FEMA’s process. This is wrong. Taxpayers in my district pay into the Disaster Relief Fund and it should be there for them when they need it. By passing this bill into law, we will help level the playing field.  I hope the Senate will consider the disaster supplemental soon not only help those recovering in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico, but also to make it more fair for people in my district and downstate Illinois.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRodneyDavis/videos/1345370358902506/",NA,12,0,4,0,0,0,0,0
