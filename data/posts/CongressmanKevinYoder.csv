Likewise, President Trump should have our nation's support to carry out his mission to protect our nation's borders, but he must do so without unnecessarily burdening lawful entrants into the United States or discriminating against specific religions  It's clear right now the order is being interpreted too broadly to block valid visas and green card holders.

Perhaps the biggest takeaway from this morning‚Äôs meeting is the concern that those who weren‚Äôt able to obtain affordable health insurance because of pre-existing conditions prior to the ACA will be left out in the cold as we replace it. We must ensure that does not happen as we replace the ACA. But at the same time, we must ensure that costs don‚Äôt skyrocket for everyone else as a result, as we saw under Obamacare. We‚Äôll do it by building a smarter, patient-centered system with more choices and competition for coverage at a lower cost. And it‚Äôs my hope that we‚Äôll do it with bipartisan support.

Today, I met with Marti and Roger Dart from Leawood, as well as Karey Padding from Andover, of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to talk about how their lives have been personally affected by cystic fibrosis. The disease affects more than 30,000 people in the United States, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year. During our discussion, we talked about the needs of the cystic fibrosis community as we continue the process of repairing our broken health care system, as well as the importance of funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for research and removing red tape at the Food and Drug Administration to facilitate cystic fibrosis drug discovery and development. As a strong advocate for increased funding to finding cures and treatments for rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, I will continue to do my part so that we can advance understanding of this little-known disease and to create new treatments and eventually find a cure.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinYoder/photos/a.154324054620516.46056.154026694650252/1408012335918342/?type=3",NA,23,27,1,1,0,0,0,0

Because of how rare these diseases are, most of them lack the awareness, funding, and research to find cures. Stunningly ‚Äì 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA approved drug treatment. That‚Äôs why federal funding for research at the National Institutes of Health is so important. The private sector simply doesn‚Äôt have the resources to invest in research for every disease. I will continue to fight for NIH funding at the federal level and work to bring these dollars to Kansas institutions that play such an important role in fighting rare disease, like the University of Kansas Medical Center and Children's Mercy Hospital.

I was very close to my Grandma as many of us are to our grandparents. She was a sweet and kind woman who could tell a good story, never met a stranger, and had an infectious laugh. I spent much of my childhood listening to her hum church hymns while cooking a country meal or quilting another masterpiece.   One of 14 children, she grew up in another era, a time without a cell phones or television, or even electricity and the other modern conveniences we take for granted today. Yet she somehow survived and had a remarkable life. She saw hard times, from the dust bowl, to the great depression, to countless world events over the past century.   She also saw great times. She lived her entire life near Yoder where she raised her children on the same farm that I grew up on. She was a living embodiment of the values that helped make America the greatest country in the world. She was guided every day by her faith in God, her love of her family, and her belief in hard work and self-determination.   In her later years, she passed the time reading her Bible and of course quilting and playing lots of games. The last time I was with her recently, we played Bingo together and wiped out the competition at her retirement home one last time. She was sharp until her final hours.   Grandma, we were so blessed to have so many wonderful years with you. Thank you for being the best Grandma anyone could ever have. As you pass on to eternal life, please know that you are an inspiration to all of us every day. May you rest in peace.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinYoder/photos/a.154324054620516.46056.154026694650252/1451954074857501/?type=3",NA,151,44,1,28,0,0,27,0

I had a great time visiting with Rachel and her parents, Jawanda and Jonathan, as well as several other NDSS advocates in DC this week while they were here for the NDSS Buddy Walk on Washington.

It is a bipartisan agreement that shows Congress is working with the Trump Administration to keep the government running smoothly to ensure seniors depending on Medicare and Social Security, our veterans depending on VA benefits, and active duty military depending on their pay checks are receiving the services they need, while also achieving significant conservative gains compared to the last eight years. It makes needed investments in medical research ‚Äì including another $2 billion for research at the NIH for a 13% increase over the last two years ‚Äì as well as education, protecting our border, and our soldiers.

There are two questions I answer with respect to every vote on the House floor: is this the right bill for my district and will it make the future of America stronger. The American Health Care Act succeeds on both.  Obamacare‚Äôs big government mandates, taxes, and spending are destroying our health care system today. The last insurance providers are pulling out of Iowa and dozens of counties across Tennessee and Virginia ‚Äì leaving millions on the individual market with no options for care ‚Äì and Kansas could be next. The American Health Care Act makes necessary and immediate repairs to the devastated system left in Obamacare‚Äôs wake, and will provide more choice, more competition, lower premiums, and greater access to care in the future. It reduces taxes and spending, and lowers federal deficits.   Let me be clear ‚Äì no one with preexisting conditions can or will be denied affordable coverage under the AHCA now or ever. In reality, our bill frees states to develop innovative ways to provide them with better coverage than they receive now and invests nearly $140 billion to help them succeed in doing it.  We are seeing the dangerous collapse of Obamacare play out across the country. Rather than forcing Americans to buy plans they don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt afford, regulating insurance providers out of the market altogether, or leaving people with no options to choose from, the AHCA makes the necessary changes to repair our health care system that‚Äôs collapsing before our eyes. For these reasons, today I voted yes.","status",NA,NA,506,2460,175,32,7,3,157,2079

FACT: Under the AHCA, rules that prevent insurance providers from denying coverage or charging more expensive rates based on health status remain the law of the land.   If states can show they have new innovative solutions to protect individuals with preexisting conditions in a better way, they can waive out of this regulatory framework ONLY for individuals who have gone more than two months without purchasing insurance.  As long as you have continuous coverage, you CANNOT be charged more based on health status in ANY state.  Even if you have a gap in coverage, insurers can only charge you a higher premium for 12 months, then you are returned to paying the same premiums as everyone else.  On top of the $130 billion investment in risk mitigation programs in the bill, the AHCA devotes $8 billion over five years to further stabilize the premiums of the small subset of people who would be affected.  ***Click below for links to the bill text supporting these facts.","link","http://yoder.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/american-health-care-act-myth-vs-fact","yoder.house.gov",223,526,199,14,8,2,6,260

However, the ACA was structured to presume eligibility of an applicant from the onset, allowing the Administration to disperse subsidies while attempting to verify eligibility and resulting in the unlawful disbursements to those 500,000 individuals.   Today, we passed the Verify First Act, which makes simple but important structural changes to the law to prevent taxpayer subsidies under the ACA or premium tax credits under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) from being dispersed until we can determine the legal status of the recipient. It‚Äôs an example of Congress working in a bipartisan manner to save taxpayer dollars and get health care resources to the people need it, not people here in our country illegally.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinYoder/photos/a.154324054620516.46056.154026694650252/1534343179951923/?type=3",NA,48,59,5,9,0,0,1,21

That‚Äôs why it's important that we stand together ‚Äì Republicans and Democrats ‚Äì to help working families deal with the exploding costs of childcare, which have increased by 168% over the last 25 years. On Wednesday, I hosted a roundtable discussion on this issue at the Mastin Street KinderCare location in Overland Park to talk with KinderCare Education officials, childcare experts, parents, and advocates about my bipartisan bill, the Promoting Affordable Childcare for Everyone (PACE) Act.   The PACE Act makes important updates and reforms to our childcare tax credits and flex spending accounts to help middle class and low-income families pay for care for their children. It raises the value of the childcare tax credit by 15% for all families, indexes the credit to inflation to help keep up the pace with rising costs, and makes the credit refundable so families who are at or near the poverty line will have access to it. We also enhance the childcare flex spending accounts by increasing the amount of pre-tax dollars families can put into FSAs by 50% and index the new cap to inflation.   This is not a partisan issue. Every American family, across both political parties, in all regions of the country, wants to be able to afford quality early-childhood education to prepare their children for the future. I want to thank Mastin Street KinderCare and Center Director Rachel Dorman for hosting this discussion, Kim Engelman and other advocates from Child Care Aware who have been strong proponents of our bill, and to all the parents who made time in their busy schedules to be there this week. U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, the bill‚Äôs lead Democrat sponsor, and I are going to continue advocating for the PACE Act so we can deliver tax relief to the families who need it most.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinYoder/photos/a.154324054620516.46056.154026694650252/1608522245867349/?type=3",NA,52,9,6,2,0,0,0,6

We are a nation of immigrants. Yet, we are also a nation that values the rule of law, and President Obama‚Äôs DACA order was an unconstitutional abuse of executive authority. The Administration is right to restore proper balance of powers under our Constitution.   I opposed President Obama's ‚Äòtemporary stopgap measure‚Äô as he called it five years ago - in which he said ‚Äòthis is not amnesty, this is not immunity, this is not a path to citizenship‚Äô - because it would leave many undocumented immigrants in limbo, with no real status. That has now proven to be the case.   While the program may have been conceived with good intentions, it has served as a magnet, bringing tens of thousands of new immigrants, exacerbating our illegal immigration challenges, and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border.   The President has given Congress a six-month window to act on immigration reform, and that's exactly what we should do. We must secure our borders, repair our broken visa program, and provide needed reforms and certainty and stability for minors. We must pursue policies that are both compassionate and restore the rule of law in our country.   I do not favor deporting 'dreamers' but their status is a decision that can only be made by an act of Congress and should be one that improves our legal immigration process and secures our border. Otherwise we will be left with a piecemeal mess, which is what we have on our hands today.","status",NA,NA,716,650,108,52,5,3,23,349

Right now there are more than one million immigrants who have come to the United States the right way ‚Äì through the legal process ‚Äì who are pursuing the American Dream, raising their families, and working hard to make our country more prosperous. Many have formed an advocacy group called Immigration Voice, which I met with last night at the Capitol.   These people are trying to get the legal permanent residence they deserve, but are stuck in a massive backlog up to as much as 70 years due to arbitrary caps on how many green cards immigrants from specific countries can receive. The result is many people here from India and China are often faced with the impossible choice of keeping their job and legal status in the United States or attending a loved one‚Äôs funeral back home. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm fighting to pass a fix to this injustice, my bill  HR 392 called the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act.   Right here in the Third District, Sunayana Dumala lost her husband Srinivas in the tragic shooting at Austin‚Äôs Bar and Grill in Olathe ‚Äì a senseless murder no one should ever have to endure. But because of these unfair backlogs, Sunayana was faced with the prospect of having to return home to India because of her visa status. Thankfully, we were able to help her stay for now and are working towards a permanent fix, but if our bill had already been signed into law she would likely have already gained permanent residence and would not have faced the threat of deportation on top of the horrific loss of her loving husband.

These are individuals from nations like India and China who work hard, many of whom who want to start their own small businesses to create more American jobs, but cannot because of backlogs created by arbitrary and unnecessary roadblocks in our employment-based green card laws. Many immigrants from those nations will go their entire life waiting for permanent residence, while others from small countries cut them in line and receive green cards after two or three years. We can all agree that is a grave injustice.   Yesterday, I met with Prakash Wadhwa from Overland Park while he was in DC with an advocacy organization called Skilled Immigrants In America and talked about my bill, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act to help these people. My bill would make the system a first-come, first-serve system based on merit ‚Äì because what you can contribute to the economy should matter more than the nation listed on your birth certificate. Importantly, it fixes an existing issue in the proper legal immigration channels, which are all too often forgotten or ignored in our debates over what to do about those who have crossed our borders illegally.

We‚Äôre passing historic, sweeping reforms that will fix the broken tax code in America for the first time in 30 years.  The typical family of four making the median household income of $59,000 ‚Äì the middle class ‚Äì will see a tax cut of nearly $1,200 under these reforms. On top of that, America will see real economic recovery we‚Äôve been missing for the last ten years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will boost wages, according to non-partisan estimates, by nearly four and a half percent. As President John F. Kennedy used to say, ‚Äòthe rising tide lifts all boats.‚Äô  More money in your pocket, higher wages on your paycheck ‚Äì it‚Äôs a win for middle class, hardworking families all around. Importantly, the bill specifically targets help for families with children with the increased Child Tax Credit, creation of the Family Credit, and preservation of the Adoption Tax Credit. Through the process, I worked hard to preserve the child care tax credits and flex spending accounts for working moms and dads.  With these reforms, Americans across the country living paycheck to paycheck get relief from their tremendous tax burden. Those suffering from economic anxiety no longer need to navigate complex loopholes to figure out how the government wants to reward their behavior. They‚Äôll have the freedom to choose how to spend their own money. And the lower you get down the economic ladder, the bigger the benefits of this bill get. The Joint Committee on Taxation shows that the biggest percent reduction in taxes paid goes to Americans making between $20,000 and $30,000.  The time for action is now. Like President Reagan once said, ‚Äòthere are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.‚Äô Today, I‚Äôm proud to cast a vote for that freedom, and to deliver on a promise to provide tax relief the American people deserve.","status",NA,NA,144,421,17,19,11,1,10,249

We're fighting for the principles that a simple and fair tax code will grow our economy - and your paycheck - and help you keep more of your hard-earned money at the end of the day.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our bill years in the making and a product of nearly 50 hearings and listening sessions in the House, will put our country on a path to prosperity the likes of which we haven't seen over the last ten years. Once signed into law, it will build upon our recent success - the two consecutive quarters of 3% economic growth, unemployment at 17-year lows, stock market hitting 55 record-highs, and consumer confidence the highest its been in nearly two decades. It will chart our course for a Great American Comeback, providing businesses with the opportunity to continue creating new jobs and growing paychecks. It will provide tax relief and the freedom that will alleviate the economic anxiety of the 78% of families living paycheck to paycheck in America.   As the most important priority in Congress right now, I want to thank Leawood Chamber CEO Kevin Jeffries for inviting me to speak with and listen to local leaders on their thoughts on our efforts, and I want to thank Leawood Mayor Peggy Dunn for her leadership in our community. I appreciated hearing feedback from chamber members as we continue to move through the process.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanKevinYoder/photos/a.154324054620516.46056.154026694650252/1702368419816064/?type=3",NA,42,119,4,7,5,0,1,55

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, where they make up 99.2% of all Kansas businesses ‚Äì with 53,000 small business owners in the Third District. This week, I joined NFIB for a business roundtable to discuss how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reduce taxes and help small business owners by lowering the tax on small business to 25%.    During the roundtable discussion, Jon Schram, small business owner of an IT service company in KCK, was encouraged not only by tax reform, but the general sense of economic optimism the new administration and Congress has brought through regulatory reforms. He said that 2017 has been his best yet, growing his company by 25% and adding four new full time employees. We must continue down the path to prosperity with tax reform, businesses like these are depending on it.

We've worked hard to produce tax legislation in the House that would give a typical Overland Park teacher a tax cut of about $1,800. But I've listened to many teachers and advocates who recognize the educator expense deduction as one small way to show teachers our appreciation for their hard work. This important deduction should remain in our tax code.    The best way to legislate in Congress is to work together, listen to our constituents, and take their concerns to Washington. That's what I'm doing here today with this letter to the conference committee. Ultimately, the goal of tax reform is to increase economic opportunity for hardworking Americans like our teachers, and we can do it in an even better way by expanding this deduction in addition to cutting their taxes.

This was a vote to give relief to the 75 percent of Americans currently living paycheck to paycheck who have been suffering from a stifling economic anxiety and little to no wage growth over the last eight years. Today‚Äôs vote was a vote for every family, every single mom, every entrepreneur, and every student fighting to climb up the economic ladder and achieve the American Dream.   The typical middle class family will see a tax cut of $2,059 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On top of that, the typical middle class family in Kansas will see an increase in after-tax income by $2,500 ‚Äì meaning they‚Äôll finally get that pay raise they‚Äôve been hoping for the last decade.    We do it primarily by making three vital changes to our tax code. We double the standard deduction, making the first $24,000 of a family‚Äôs income tax-free. We double the child tax credit to $2,000 and make it refundable, allowing low-income families to reduce their payroll tax burden. And we lower tax rates for all Americans.    The facts show that relief is specifically targeted to middle and low-income Americans, fulfilling our promise to lower the tax burden for those who need it the most. Analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that those making between $20,000 and $30,000 per year will see the largest percentage tax cut under our bill.   In Congress, it‚Äôs a fight between those who demand higher taxes and more spending in Washington and those who want to return tax dollars to the hardworking Americans who earned them. Today, the Washington bureaucrats lost and the American people won.","status",NA,NA,139,209,7,13,4,1,3,188
