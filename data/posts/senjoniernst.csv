There is no question that he has served as an extraordinary leader in our military in the United States Marine Corps, and as the former Commander of U.S. Central Command and coauthor of the Counterinsurgency Field Manual.   During our meeting, we discussed a wide-range of topics, including my priority of the need to combat sexual assault in the military. We also talked about the many threats rising around the globe, including Asia and Europe. I look forward to asking General Mattis more questions and getting his public confirmation to work with me on my priorities during his upcoming confirmation hearing. I am extremely concerned about the rising threat of ISIS in areas like Southeast Asia and Latin America, as well as many other threats that the incoming administration needs to address.    As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet him for this position and ensuring he will focus on these objectives and more in this position.  http://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/1/photo-ernst-meets-with-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-james-mattis","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senjoniernst/photos/a.368712846623489.1073741828.351671691660938/637219069772864/?type=3",NA,254,12,8,11,0,0,0,0

In particular, I stressed the urgent need to pursue Sarah’s Law, legislation to honor Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed nearly a year ago by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The problems with the current administration’s enforcement priorities and lack of engagement with victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is completely unacceptable. It is my hope that the new administration will work with Congress to implement this legislation.  Additionally, I underscored my increasing concerns over the rise of ISIS in Latin America, which I previously expressed to President Obama. We must not turn a blind eye to this emerging threat and the potential for international terror groups to exploit smuggling routes used by drug cartels. As the former Commander of the United States Southern Command, I sought assurances from General Kelly that the new administration would lead where this current administration has failed.  I am grateful for the thoughtful, productive dialogue today, and I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet General Kelly for this position in the Senate.  http://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/1/photo-ernst-meets-with-secretary-of-homeland-security-nominee-general-john-kelly","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senjoniernst/photos/a.368712846623489.1073741828.351671691660938/637584376403000/?type=3",NA,205,27,20,16,0,0,0,0

It is unconscionable that nearly one year after Sarah’s death, her killer, Edwin Mejia remains at-large, and the fact remains that today U.S. immigration law does not require federal immigration authorities to detain those here illegally who harm American citizens. Although nothing can bring Sarah back to her family or heal the wounds of such unimaginable loss, we have an obligation to the American people to ensure that no citizen falls victim to this injustice again. Sarah’s Law is about honoring Sarah, and her legacy; I have already had conversations with the incoming administration, and am hopeful that they will work with Congress to pursue this legislation and finally get some long-overdue justice for the Root family.  http://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=DE7DCE98-E0DF-4165-BFF3-F965D9648CFF","link","http://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=DE7DCE98-E0DF-4165-BFF3-F965D9648CFF","ernst.senate.gov",184,9,18,16,0,0,5,0

In regards to RFS, it is imperative that the law is followed. I received assurances from Mr. Pruitt that he intends to do so, and I will hold him to that commitment. I was pleased to hear that President-elect Trump made it clear to Mr. Pruitt that he cares about the RFS. Mr. Pruitt told me in our meeting that the role of the EPA is to enforce the law as written by Congress, and not undermine the RFS.   I stressed that a strong and robust RFS encourages consumer choice, investment, and innovation. The RFS is a major driver of alternative fuels and economic development, and I will always protect and promote it in the Senate.   We also discussed increasing concerns over the environmental regulations coming out of the EPA. Overall, we had a thoughtful conversation about the need to do everything possible to fix these federal overreaches and get the EPA back on track to operating within the congressional intent of our laws, acknowledging the federal-state partnerships that exist and faithfully considering the comments of the public.

Sexual assault and disgusting online activity will continue to plague our nation and our military until we take concrete steps forward to address this horrific issue and change the culture within our society. This legislation gives the military an opportunity to lead by example, and it ensures they don’t create an ineffective computer-based teaching program to do it. The military can help prevent sexual assaults and horrific online activity from happening in the first place by sitting down and talking with servicemembers about what is right, and what is wrong. This is especially important for those just entering the service, and it is my hope that this reinforces that these acts will not be tolerated.

Unfortunately, the reality is this: arbitrary timelines, troop levels, and an overall lack of strategy from the previous Administration has created an environment in Afghanistan where 20 of the world’s international terror networks reside, the Taliban is resurging, and the region is vulnerable to the malign influence of Iran and Russia. As Secretary James Mattis recently described, ""we are not winning in Afghanistan.""   Maintaining the status quo is unacceptable to our national security and unacceptable to our troops and their families.    Tonight the President outlined his vision for a new strategy in Afghanistan - one which prioritizes the need for increased cooperation with regional partners such as Pakistan and India.   Now is not the time to abandon our fight against terrorism in Afghanistan, its people or our international partners.  Instead, we must once again lead from a position of strength. Therefore, moving forward, I am committed to both guaranteeing our servicemembers are well-equipped for combat, while also holding the Department of Defense and the Administration accountable for ensuring the effectiveness of this strategy.","status",NA,NA,422,216,41,36,6,2,10,100

Unfortunately a final deal was cut and while it includes initial relief funding, it also raises the debt limit and kicks the can down the road once again on our overall government spending levels. This is not the right way to legislate, and quite frankly, it is exactly what the American people are sick and tired of. I called for the August state work period to be canceled so that we could address issues such as the debt limit and our annual spending bills. Instead, Congress went home for several weeks when we should have been in Washington working to find solutions to many of these issues.  Washington continues to raise the debt limit without addressing the spending problems, implementing spending reforms, or working toward a balanced budget. We must get back to regular order when it comes to the debt limit and the continuing resolution (CR), rather than using this disaster to cut backroom deals. That is unacceptable.  The White House and this Congress must do better for the American people. I cannot support these efforts to raise the debt limit while failing to put into place any spending constraints or a clear path forward to get our debt under control.    We are nearly $20 trillion in debt, and today Washington is showing little regard toward getting serious about cutting spending.  All across Iowa, I hear from folks who have said enough is enough when it comes to our debt, and that we simply can’t continue spending money that we don’t have. I agree. Therefore, while I supported a standalone vote on Hurricane Harvey disaster relief funding, I cannot support a bloated overall deal that hands Washington another credit card without a limit and avoids the thoughtful legislating the American people expect from Congress.  Yesterday, I called for the October state work period to be canceled, and after today’s disappointing outcome, I hope my colleagues will be willing to get to work on the incredible number of items at hand this fall. https://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=A56703E5-9620-4082-9098-24AAAF0E047C","link","https://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=A56703E5-9620-4082-9098-24AAAF0E047C","ernst.senate.gov",160,135,22,8,6,2,17,49
