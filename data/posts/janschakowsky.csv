Last night, they met behind closed doors and rigged the rules in their favor. They hoped that they could completely gut the Office of Congressional Ethics without the American people and House Democrats taking notice. Faced with overwhelming opposition, they were forced to withdraw that change.   Now, Republicans have come up with unconstitutional rules to punish Democrats for practicing their right to free speech after the anti-gun violence sit-in this summer. Further, the Republican rules package will make it easier to take away healthcare and slash Social Security’s and Medicare’s earned benefits.   Rather than ‘draining the swamp,’ Republicans are feeding the hungry alligators. Democrats won’t be silenced and won’t be stifled. We will fearlessly stand for freedom of speech and resist their dangerous agenda.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-to-start-on-ambitious-conservative-agenda-as-congress-convenes-today/2017/01/03/6117cbe2-d1a1-11e6-945a-76f69a399dd5_story.html","washingtonpost.com",497,100,105,39,6,7,4,97

One week after House Republicans tried and failed to do away with the Office of Congressional Ethics, their colleagues in the Senate have ignored the concerns of the Office of Government Ethics by going forward with confirmation hearings before the nominees have been properly vetted. This weekend, the Director of the independent Office of Government Ethics criticized rushing confirmation hearings when several of Mr. Trump’s nominees have ‘unknown or unresolved ethics issues.’  Before any of President-elect Trump’s nominees are considered, ethics paperwork and financial disclosures should be submitted in full, and Senators should be given at least three days to study the materials. Americans deserve to know that their government is working in the interest of the public and not for themselves. There is no excuse for Senate Republicans cutting corners because nominees have failed to submit complete information on time. A full ethics review must be performed before confirmation hearings take place.  One of the hallmarks of the outgoing Obama administration has been a strict adherence to governmental ethics rules, which led to eight years without even a hint of a scandal. Now, the Trump administration is kicking off by ignoring ethics reviews and creating a scandal waiting to happen. No previous administration in modern history has acted like this to confirm their nominees. The move has been called ‘unprecedented’ by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics and must be rectified immediately.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ethics-official-warns-against-confirmations-before-reviews-are-complete/2017/01/07/e85a97ee-d348-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html?utm_term=.f74177b1d439","washingtonpost.com",215,28,85,1,1,11,8,82

When it comes to the tax code, they’re right. GDP has never been higher – but almost all of that growth has gone to the very richest. At the same time, the rich aren’t paying their fair share to meet the urgent needs of our country, from infrastructure and housing to health care and education. Our top tax rate is lower now than it was at any time from 1932 to 1986.  That is why I was delighted to introduce the Fairness in Taxation Act, which would make the rich pay their fair share of taxes by adding new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires. Right now, our tax code has seven different bracket tax brackets with the highest at 39.6% for income over $418,400.  As a result, an individual who makes $418,401,000 is paying the same statutory rate as someone who earns $418,401.  Once special tax advantages for the super-wealthy are factored in, their effective tax rate is often far less.  By creating five new tax brackets that only affect millionaires and billionaires, the Fairness in Taxation Act would raise over $800 billion in the next decade with no additional taxes on middle-class families.The revenue from the Fairness in Taxation Act could be injected directly back into the economy by funding federal priorities that will strengthen our communities and grow the middle class.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/636/","link","https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/636/","congress.gov",290,27,37,32,0,3,1,0

Republicans in Congress voted against language that I offered, which prevents insurance companies from charging women more than men. In Illinois, before the Affordable Care Act, women were charged up to 55% more than men for the same plans.  President Trump signed an executive order meant to undermine the ACA, which provides women with access to contraception with no out-of-pocket costs, ensures women are not charged more than men for their insurance, and requires insurance companies to cover benefits that are critical for women, like maternity care.

He co-patrocinado dos propuestas legislativas (the Protecting our Border Communities Act y the Community Trust Act) para pelear en contra de las acciones ejecutivas y directivas del Presidente sobre la inmigración. También lucharé en contra de cualquier intento que haya en el Congreso para dirigir fondos hacia estas directivas inhumanas.  En estos días de incertidumbre, es más importante que nunca que los inmigrantes, sus seres queridos, y cualquier persona que defienda a sus vecinos – sin importar su estatus migratorio – conozca sus derechos legales.

They have bizarrely labeled the press as ‘the opposition party’ and openly criticized reporters for fairly reporting on the Administration’s many blunders, missteps, and abuses of power in its first few weeks.   Yesterday, the White House escalated its attacks on our free press to unacceptable levels. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly sought to cajole the FBI into quashing stories about the Trump Administration’s connections to Russia. Administration officials should be investigated and held accountable for meddling into an ongoing federal investigation of enormous national importance.   Later, Press Secretary Sean Spicer barred journalists from major news outlets including the New York Times, CNN, Politico, and the LA Times from attending an on-the-record briefing while including right-wing news outlets friendly to the Trump Administration. That is not a mere deviation from protocol; it is a calculated effort to stifle the truth and keep the White House’s failures from going public.   Freedom of the press is a foundational principle of a democratic society, and any attempt to undermine it is an attack on democracy itself.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/24/white-house-blocks-cnn-new-york-times-from-press-briefing-hours-after-trump-slams-media/?tid=pm_politics_pop&utm_term=.4fd50dffd430","washingtonpost.com",133,42,76,2,2,10,6,84

At the same time, it continues the President's hateful anti-immigrant agenda.

This use of excessive force is absolutely unacceptable. The Response from United Airlines has been brazenly inadequate – their apology over having to ‘re-accommodate’ passengers is completely insulting, and their attempt to pass the buck by blaming the Chicago Police Department for the incident demonstrates that they do not understand the gravity of this incident.

So, if you’re between jobs or providing family caregiving, you can by denied the benefits you need.  2. It gives each state the ability to charge you more – just like before the ACA when insurers raised premiums because someone had asthma, was a cancer survivor, or was born with a chronic condition.  3. Each state can also cut back on essential health benefits – so the services you need might not be covered.  And that means you either pay for them yourself or go without.

This Republican bill will not become law in its current form. And yet, Republicans have walked the plank for it, telling their constituents that they don’t care about the 24 million or more people who would lose health insurance because of this bill. They are telling people that they favor a $600 billion tax cut for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations paid for by cutting Medicaid by $880 billion.

There is no evidence – zero – of widespread voter fraud.  The Committee on House Administration found that the attempted voter fraud rate was .00000010247, and there is bipartisan agreement that there is no evidence of significant voter fraud.  Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes – there is no getting around that fact and, as many tweets as he may send, trying to pin it on voter fraud doesn’t pass the laugh test.  Instead of spending time and taxpayer dollars to investigate an imaginary problem, we should focus changing state laws designed to suppress voting – like the photo ID law in Wisconsin that prevented nearly 200,000 people from casting a ballot.  What makes it all the worse is that this partisan investigation may be used to justify further impediments on American citizens’ right to vote.  Our elections are not at risk because of nonexistent voter fraud, but instead because of the role of Russian operatives meddling into our electoral process and their possible collusion with the Trump Campaign.  President Trump is doing everything he can to prevent the American public from getting the answers they deserve.  It is no coincidence that today’s announcement comes days after President Trump fired the FBI Director overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in our democracy and any collusion with the Trump campaign.   Despite attempts to divert attention and change the subject, we will continue to fight for a special prosecutor so that the Russian role in the 2016 election is made clear and wrongdoers are held accountable.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-creates-voter-fraud-panel-that-critics-call-a-sham/2017/05/11/24310f54-3664-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?utm_term=.ea798ff7a55b","washingtonpost.com",118,39,26,1,2,0,3,52

Both are excellent models for how government funding benefits children, seniors, and the disabled. I am proud to see these examples at work in my district, and thank the hard-working women and men who invited me to see first-hand the great work they do to provide health care and housing.  Unfortunately, President Trump’s first full budget outline targets and threatens programs like these, instead of using them as models. His budget cuts grant programs and investment partnerships that would mean fewer affordable homes being built and less help for Americans struggling to afford a place to live. His cruel and immoral budget would mean that 23 million Americans lose their health insurance, including 13 million who are currently on Medicaid. It would also cut the Medicaid program by $1.3 trillion. That would mean that the Care Mobile would see the number of children and families who need their service increase significantly, while facing a sharp drop in funding.  Budgets are about priorities. Last week we saw what the President’s priorities are: tax cuts for the rich at the expense of housing and health care for everyone else. Today I saw two shining examples of a different set of priorities – a government providing a basic standard of living, that invests in job-creation in our communities, and that provides opportunities for all Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/janschakowsky/photos/a.215870837118.165383.160143957118/10155917493982119/?type=3",NA,34,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

The tax plan unveiled by Republicans today fails this test spectacularly. It would make the rich much richer and the poor even poorer.  The GOP tax plan uses the tired and cruel formula we’ve come to expect from Republicans: cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy and pay for it by robbing Americans of key programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. There is nothing in this plan – not one line – that would benefit America’s middle class or those who aspire to be middle class. It is a bill designed to improve the lives of Donald Trump’s cronies and no one else.   Our tax code is in serious need of reform. We need to demand that the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our country pay their fair share so we can truly invest in American families. That’s how our economy will grow, and that’s how we will improve the lives of Americans. The bill that Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Donald Trump so proudly presented today is a disgusting, but not surprising, slap in the face to every day Americans. It is even more disgusting that Republicans wasted the day peddling this plan when the authorization for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Community Health Centers, and Teaching Health Centers expire this Saturday, September 30.   Republicans seem to have no time on their hands to ensure that America’s children get health insurance, but have all the time in the world to ensure that America’s billionaires get tax cuts.","link","https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/27/16368612/trump-tax-cut-principles","vox.com",192,51,97,5,3,2,18,93

What did Republican leaders present? Massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and tax breaks for multinational corporations that outsource the jobs of American workers.  Almost all of the benefits of this Republican tax scheme go to the super-wealthy, and it gives job-killing tax cuts to corporations that offshore profits. Republicans will pay for those tax giveaways by slashing Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure, and other vital services that Americans depend on.  Supporting this bill requires ignoring history, logic, and basic math. We’ve seen this scam before. President George W. Bush tried it in 2001, and then we had the Great Recession in 2008. Tax cuts for the rich don’t trickle down to the middle class. And tax breaks for the profits of multinational corporations don’t go to their workers. This bill will increase costs for middle-class families, seniors, and people with disabilities. It’s dishonest, unfair, and dangerous to our country’s future.","status",NA,NA,100,51,57,3,0,1,20,125

The Children’s Health Insurance Program provides health care to 9 million kids across the country, including 1.6 million children in Illinois. The program has been hugely successful: since its inception in 1997, the rate of uninsured children in our country has dropped by 66%. For two decades, the reauthorization of the program had received broad bipartisan support. Until now.  Today, Republicans are forcing us to vote on an unfair, partisan bill that proposes paying for CHIP by completely assaulting other areas of our health care system. Republicans are willing to pay for health care for kids, but only if we agree to gut the public health Prevention Fund, completely undermine the Medicare program, and change the rules of the Affordable Care Act so that nearly 700,000 Americans lose their insurance.  Republicans are trying to sneak cruel and ridiculous provisions into a bill that should be simple and straightforward. The cuts in this bill would slash funding for children’s vaccination programs, lead poisoning prevention programs, and chronic health condition prevention programs. This bill is unacceptable.

Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, but taking this step outside of the framework of a final status agreement derails the peace process, jeopardizes our ability to help broker an agreement, and creates the likelihood of more violence in the region.  There is reason that virtually all of our allies have urged us not to take this step. I continue to believe that the only path to sustainable peace is a two-state solution that allows Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side with economic prosperity and security. President Trump’s action has made that much more difficult to achieve.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",112,35,16,3,3,5,22,32

Instead of using their full control of the federal government to move an agenda that improves the lives of working men and women – or even to guarantee that kids get health care and that hard-working young people aren’t deported – Republicans have spent their time finding more and more creative ways to improve the lot of millionaires, billionaires, and corporate special interests. Even in this cruel pursuit, they have been ineffective, bringing us once again to the brink of a government shutdown just to kick the can two weeks down the road. Republicans have the wrong priorities and are incapable of governing.

The health care of 9 million children and the lives of 800,000 passionate young people have been in limbo ever since. Republicans have spent the months since then working tirelessly to take away Americans’ health care and pass a tax bill that benefits only the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations.  Today, Republicans were unable and unwilling to pass a robust government funding bill. Instead they kicked the can down the road yet again – only funding the government until January 19th. A day after passing their $1.5 trillion tax scam, my Republican colleagues pushed a disaster relief bill that fails to address the needs of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and a government funding bill that fails the American people.
