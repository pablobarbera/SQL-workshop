As a physician of over 25 years, access to quality healthcare for every American is a concern that is close to my heart. By authorizing doctors to violate the Hippocratic Oath of “do no harm,” I believe physician-assisted suicide undermines a key safeguard that protects our nation’s most vulnerable citizens and ensures our loved ones receive the best medical care when they need it most.    Congress has the responsibility under the U.S. Constitution and the D.C. Home Rule Act to review actions by the District of Columbia. If we failed to act, it would would imply federal approval of physician-assisted suicide – which is not the right path.

After working on behalf of the United States as interpreters in our hospital in Iraq, their lives were in jeopardy if they remained in their own country. Today, they and their families are U.S. citizens. Their children are bilingual and beautiful. Both men are practicing physicians here today in our United States – productive citizens and proud Americans. Having worked with these gentlemen for one year under extreme and often intense circumstances in Iraq, I was confident in their character as they went through extensive vetting before coming to the United States.  On the other hand, the reality is that there are many in their land who want to kill Americans and bring harm to our nation. I witnessed this firsthand serving in Iraq. Regardless of the amount of kindness we extended -- especially as physicians and nurses -- many of the citizens we cared for expressed gratitude for their medical care while still maintaining their desire to kill us.  As we have seen, Americans are increasingly at risk at home and abroad. Our intelligence sources have identified certain unstable countries as higher risk of terrorists attempting to enter the United States. Our intelligence officials have, for some time, confirmed the inadequacy of our vetting procedures. That’s why, on Friday, the administration issued an executive action ordering a 90-day pause (not a permanent ban) and reevaluation of our screening process of people traveling to the U.S. from seven war-torn countries and a 120-day pause and reevaluation of our refugee resettlement program. The nations identified do not yet have the ability to assist us with sufficient data on those attempting to enter the United States, thus increasing the risk, and have been designated by the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to U.S. law as being “countries of concern”  under the Obama administration. Attempts by declared jihadists to blend in with refugees is well understood.  A temporary pause and reevaluation of refugee programs is consistent with the previous administration’s actions, which temporarily paused the Iraqi refugee program after discovering a terror plot in Kentucky being launched by two Iraqi refugees. While thoughtful clarifications are needed to address any unintended consequences of the administration’s order, taking a comprehensive look at our vetting process is a commonsense security measure.  I do believe that those with green cards and those that have stood in support of our men and women in uniform deserve special consideration and accommodation, and I urge the administration to make resolving the cases of individuals who served alongside U.S. troops a top priority.   Bottom-line: Our compassion must not come at the cost of our national security -- but our security must also never cost us our national identity. Let’s take a deep breath, remedy any unintended consequences, and work to enhance the safety of our families while continuing to be a beacon of hope for persecuted people of the world who seek refuge in free lands.","status",NA,NA,846,291,364,90,1,0,4,37

Some backstory: In response to these whistle-blower allegations, the Chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Subcommittee on Defense of the House Appropriations Committee set up a Joint Congressional Task Force led by Reps. Ken Calvert, Mike Pompeo, and myself.   In August of last year, our task force released initial findings that intelligence products on the U.S. counter-ISIS mission were more positive than the assessments being produced by rest of the Intelligence Community, and the widespread internal perception that analysts’ assessments were being distorted was inadequately addressed by CENTCOM leadership.   Today, the Department of Defense Inspector General publicly released the findings of its own independent investigation, which confirm many of the deficiencies highlighted by the Congressional report.  Ultimately, there were both personal and institutional lessons learned from these investigations. It is critical that Congress follows up on the deficiencies highlighted by both independent investigations to ensure our warfighters are supported with the best analysis and most accurate intelligence possible in their continued fight to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. I will continue working with my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee to ensure that is the case.","link","http://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=761","intelligence.house.gov",17,8,2,2,0,0,0,0

In the most recent defense policy bill, which President Obama signed into law this past December, I worked to secure language to help create partnerships allowing military trauma surgeons and physicians to embed within civilian trauma centers to treat critically injured patients.   This does two important things: 1) It helps ensure trauma providers in the U.S. Armed Forces maintain medical readiness and rapid deployability for future conflicts and 2) it helps ensure that the incredible achievements and skills of our military medical professionals, honed in combat environments, are being harnessed for the benefit of our larger communities here at home.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBradWenstrup/photos/a.124594181044001.24820.124462944390458/684193535084060/?type=3",NA,43,21,1,4,0,0,0,0

Here in Ohio, agriculture is part of who we are as a state – it’s also a driving force in our economy.  Here’s the problem though: when you look at the list of regulations facing farmers, it’s incredible the red tape they have to untangle just for the regular, daily operation of a farm.   To be fair, not all regulations are bad, nor were they intended to create undue hardship for our farmers. We need common sense regulations that protect human health. We need regulations that provide for safety, protect our environment, and ensure the humane treatment of animals. However, too many of these regulations are duplicative, overly stringent, and create unintended consequences.

In 2015, Marine Corps aviation deaths hit a five-year high as aircraft failed or pilots made mistakes due to inadequate training hours.   The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army recently testified that “our Army requires modernized equipment to win decisively – but today we are outranged, outgunned, and outdated.”  For too long, we’ve taken our military for granted. We’re resourcing its current missions – such as counter-ISIL operations – but failing to fully invest in the modernization, maintenance, and capabilities that they will need to combat and defuse future threats. The impact of this is not readily visible to the public – but it comes at a cost for our warfighters, as we heard in testimony today. The House already passed defense appropriations (with a huge bipartisan vote) to begin to give troops the capabilities they need. Now, the Senate needs to take it up immediately and send it to the President’s desk.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBradWenstrup/photos/a.124594181044001.24820.124462944390458/717479801755433/?type=3",NA,17,18,4,0,0,0,0,0

One of these is a coffee shop in downtown Chillicothe, run by Anna and Megan, who, as local high school teachers, recognized the need for at-risk students to have an adult mentor in their lives. They saw a need for a positive and inviting place for their community to gather – and help foster mentoring relationships that could change the trajectory of teen’s lives. They took a leap of faith and opened Paper City Coffee that would also fund a mentoring program.   In the midst of the opioid epidemic, Anna and Megan’s mission of using their business to invest in the lives of Chillicothe youth is a perfect example of why Washington’s top priority should be empowering local employers, not regulating them out of existence. Tonight, the House will vote on H.R. 1312 – the Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act, to help get rid of unnecessary impediments to small business’ ability to raise capital and compete. I will keep fighting here in Congress to make sure our local businesses are able to grow, create jobs, and invest in our communities.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBradWenstrup/photos/a.124594181044001.24820.124462944390458/731695023667244/?type=3",NA,97,14,27,13,0,1,0,0

On top of that, it continues Washington’s cycle of “governing by crisis” with last-minute deals and appropriations bills jammed together in omnibus packages instead of thoughtfully debated one by one.    Here’s what I think: we need to add an additional layer of personal accountability to both chambers of Congress. That’s why I introduced the Do Your Job Act last Congress to withhold lawmakers’ pay if they fail to vote on 12 individual spending bills by the October 1st deadline. To me, it’s simple: if we don't fulfill the responsibilities of our office, we shouldn't get paid. Period.

Both the allegations against the administration and the fact that purported classified information is being leaked to the media warrant thorough investigation and oversight, which is why I support the House Oversight Committee’s efforts to gather relevant materials, memos, and witness testimonies. I will also continue to support and engage in the ongoing investigations by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, as well as the DOJ and FBI. Our job as representatives of the American people is not to jump to conclusions or play into the hysteria of the 24-hour news cycle. Our job is to get the facts – responsibly, dispassionately, thoughtfully, and thoroughly.    We need to put speculation and media spin aside. The American public deserves transparency and they deserve the truth: “Truth, justice, and the American way."" That will continue to be my focus, along with doing the job my constituents sent me here to do: working to jump-start the economy, streamline the tax code, care for our veterans, and protect national security.","status",NA,NA,118,127,8,5,3,3,2,17

We remember the fallen. We honor the survivors. Below is General Dwight D. Eisenhower's statement of encouragement to the soldiers preparing to fight on the beaches of Normandy:  ""Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force:  You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months.  The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.  In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.  Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.  But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.  I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.  Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBradWenstrup/photos/a.124594181044001.24820.124462944390458/749370148566398/?type=3",NA,79,13,16,7,0,0,2,1

My take: the defense budget has been cut by more than 20% since 2010, but the world hasn’t gotten any safer. Our men and women in uniform have made do for the past decade: cutting back on training hours and taking parts off other planes, ships and units to get planes, ships and equipment ready to deploy to the Middle East and across the globe. But those cutbacks have a real cost. In 2015, Marine Corps aviation deaths hit a five-year high as aircraft failed or pilots made mistakes due to inadequate training hours. Additionally, our Navy fleet is among the smallest since WWI, which means longer deployments, compounding stress on our ships, our sailors, and their families. Average deployment time has gone up roughly 30 percent in recent years, according to the Navy.  We can’t afford to continue to force our military to choose between meeting current operational requirements and meeting the challenges of tomorrow. We need to invest in the resources, equipment, and training our warfighters need to respond to conflict around the globe today, and also critical, cutting-edge capabilities they will need tomorrow.","link","https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7bukTCSgTcm2XUti/giphy.gif","media.giphy.com",75,40,14,7,3,0,2,7

True leadership is inspiring others, by example, to achieve more than they thought was possible. True leadership is about others. It's about serve and sacrifice. That's why the greatest American leaders we could ever look up to, or look to for hope in the future of our country, were right here at the wheelchair games.

Here’s my take: I have great compassion for the young people who were brought to this country illegally through no fault of their own. At the end of the day, we are a nation of immigrants. We are also a nation of laws. But we’ve never been a nation that holds children legally responsible for the actions of their parents.   DACA was a controversial and unconstitutional executive mandate. On top of that, it was never intended to be permanent – President Obama himself called it a “temporary stopgap measure.” Whatever the intention, stop-gap measures rarely result in solid, long-term policy.    Unfortunately, DACA has only exacerbated our immigration problems and contributed to the confusion. By rescinding the program with a  six month wind-down period, the administration is taking a step to restore the proper balance of powers. The Constitution is pretty straightforward about this in Article 1, Section 1, “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.”   What we need now is legislative action, which comes from the American people through their representatives in Congress. It has long been, and still is, my position that our top priorities should be securing our porous southern border and developing a legal immigration system that is beneficial to all Americans and those seeking to become Americans. Addressing the status of those in this country illegally also needs to be part of that conversation. It’s time to tackle these tough issues and work together towards long-term solutions that can be passed into law and signed by the president.   Let’s continue to uphold our national identity as a country that welcomes “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…” but let’s do it legally. Let’s protect the innocent, and work to develop a system where children are no longer put in such a position in the first place.","status",NA,NA,615,269,115,57,3,1,3,42

Why not recognize those who give their all for your freedom? Such is the national anthem.   We are a nation where we are free to right wrongs. To speak out against injustice. To work towards a more perfect union. As the song ‘America the Beautiful’ says, “God mend thine every flaw” – we are free to pursue that. The national anthem addresses that freedom. It should be respected.   After serving, the national anthem was forever changed for me. “Bombs bursting in air” wasn’t just a song lyric – I can visualize it. I’ve seen the rocket’s red glare. The last line is what brings it all together for me: “Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.”   Our freedom to disagree -- and to mend our flaws -- is represented by that flag and by our national anthem. And I will always stand for that.","status",NA,NA,677,260,99,129,5,1,1,34

It is a time for our country to collectively pause, reflect, and reevaluate how we can better provide Americans who are contemplating ending their lives with the resources and medical care they need to give them hope, and to help them know they are not alone.   Today, as part of that conversation, Democrats and Republicans gathered to discuss a bipartisan bill about the dangers of legalizing physician-assisted suicide. I introduced this bill (H.Con.Res. 80) along with 9 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, because we believe Americans deserve better.   Protecting the vulnerable and providing quality care for all patients are cornerstones of any good healthcare system. Included in that is providing comfort and care for those facing the heart-wrenching challenges of dealing with a potentially terminal illness. But physician-assisted suicide does the opposite. It undermines a key safeguard that protects our nation’s most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and people experiencing psychiatric diagnoses. It leaves patients unprotected. It prioritizes cost over compassion – potentially incentivizing payers to encourage death or care or cure.   That’s why I’m working with this bipartisan group of members to help promote greater awareness of the dangers of physician-assisted suicide, while giving voice to those who are put at most risk by the continued spread of this dangerous practice. I will continue to defend every human being’s inherent dignity, and work to ensure patients facing the possible or probable end of their lives have access to the best quality and most comprehensive medical care possible, including palliative, in-home, or hospice care, tailored to their individual needs.   When governments support, encourage, or facilitate suicide – whether assisted by physicians or others – we devalue our fellow citizens, our fellow human beings.   That is not who we are, and that is not who we should be.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBradWenstrup/videos/805679112935501/",NA,62,41,5,5,0,0,0,2

As we prepare to celebrate and thank the men and women who have dedicated their lives to serving their country, I wanted to highlight a few veterans right here in Ohio's Second District.  Tonight's OH2 veteran spotlight:  Name: Harry V. Shoop War: World War II Years of Service: 31 Story: Harry V. Shoop was born in New Jersey in 1921 and moved to Washington Court House, OH at age 3 and has since been a longtime resident of Lynchburg, OH. On October 20, 1940, Harry entered active duty service with the Ohio National Guard and was assigned to Ohio’s 37th Infantry Division and then to the 38th Infantry Division. While on active duty, Harry rose through the ranks and was promoted to platoon sergeant in both companies B & H with the 149th Infantry Regiment. During the re-taking of the Philippines during the infamous battle of Zig Zag Pass, Mr. Shoop and his unit saw 198 consecutive days of combat. This is where Harry’s hand was hit be enemy fire – but he quickly wrapped his hand and continued to fight. Harry spent 6 weeks in the 80th General Hospital in Manilla. He was honorably discharged from active duty on November 9, 1945 as Technical Sargent.  71 years later, on August 7, 2017, Harry Shoop received the medals that he earned in service to this country. During the medal ceremony that I was honored to participate in, Harry said this:  “I give thanks, in my humble way, to the United States of America and the people in it because you are the people that are America. I’m proud of each and every one of you, and I’m proud of the ones I’ve known in the past. The United States of America will always come first.”  Harry – thank you for your service.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBradWenstrup/photos/a.124594181044001.24820.124462944390458/822686307901448/?type=3",NA,275,49,88,58,0,0,0,0

Buschmeier was born in Milford, OH in 1923 and entered active duty service on January 27, 1943 – at age 19. He was trained as a flight crew member with the United States Army Air Corps, assigned to the 100th Bomber Group, 350th Bomb Squadron. Frank was then attached to the Gibbon’s Crew (named for pilot 2nd LT John Gibbons) with the Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress – the plane was affectionately named “Miss Irish”. Sgt. Frank Buschmeier served as a ‘left waist gunner’ aboard the Miss Irish. On March 19, 1944, the Miss Irish was shot down by German flak, but the experienced and calm flight crew was able to successfully land the plane. This terrifying experience was just one of many harrowing situations Sgt. Buschmeier would endure in battle. The remaining crewmembers of the Miss Irish were assigned to another plane. On July 29, 1944, while on their 34th “pick up” mission, they were shot down over Merseberg, Germany. This time, Sgt. Buschmeier was captured by the German army and held captive for 10 months in a German prison camp. Frank was honorable discharged from the U.S. Army Air Corps on October 29, 1945.   At the time of his discharge, Sgt. Frank Buschmeier was issued the Purple Heart Award, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with 4 bronze clusters, and the European-African-Middle Eastern medla with 3/bronze battle star attachments.   On May 10, 2013, it was my honor to present Sgt. Frank Buschmeier with his remaining three medals that he earned in service to this country: the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Prisoner of War Medla, and the American Campaign Medal.

This package included priorities like battling the opioid epidemic, supporting America’s farmers, securing America’s borders, and prioritizing public health and medical research.   The Senate, however, did not address or vote on a similar funding package. This Friday, December 8, marks the federal government funding deadline that was set by a short-term funding package that was passed in September.  Do you believe that Congress needs to return to the regular budget process of passing 12 appropriations bills instead of many short-term packages?
