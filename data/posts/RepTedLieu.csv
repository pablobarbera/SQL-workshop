Here is my reaction: there is clear and convincing evidence to support the conclusions of the intelligence community as set forth in the unclassified version of the report. Russian hacking of Americans and American political organizations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election was multifaceted and brazen, with the goals of undermining faith in the U.S. democratic process and harming Secretary Clinton's electability. Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for Trump.  I believe Trump is actively misleading Americans when he says the Russians did not attempt to help his election chances and denigrate Secretary Clinton’s electability. Cyber espionage against American political organizations and cyber intrusions into our electoral boards are not partisan issues, they are American issues.

The truth is that alleged voter fraud is at around .0004% and net migration from Mexico has been negative since 2008.  These are serious times that call for serious solutions. Yes, border security is a crucial pillar of comprehensive immigration reform but a huge wall won't make us any safer, morally upright, reduce the deficit or energize our economy.

But he has also taken actions that deeply matter and harmed American interests, particularly in the area of foreign affairs. His go-it-alone approach is making America more isolated and increasing risks to our deployed personnel.

In addition to her extreme views, Betsy DeVos is simply not competent to serve as Education Secretary. She has not attended or worked in public schools and it appears has made no attempt to learn about America’s public education system. As we discovered during her confirmation hearing, DeVos doesn’t know that disabled students are protected under federal law, nor does she understand the difference between proficiency and growth. It’s astonishing and downright scary how little DeVos understands about education policy and the issues facing teachers, administrators, parents and students today.  The public education system is a public good. My two children go to public school.

Ruben Gallego and I released the following statement calling for President Trump to fire General Michael Flynn.  “General Michael Flynn sought to undermine the foreign policy of a sitting American President.  And then he lied – repeatedly and egregiously – about his actions.  Donald Trump should fire Michael Flynn immediately.”    ""Flynn communicated with high-ranking Russian officials both before and after a presidential election that, according to our intelligence community, Russia actively worked to influence on behalf of Donald Trump.  When President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its unprecedented efforts to disrupt our democracy, Flynn made a series of phone calls to the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, offering assurances that the incoming administration would lift these measures after Trump was sworn-in.”   “General Flynn then compounded this outrageous misconduct by lying on multiple occasions about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak, claiming that sanctions had never been discussed.  Not only did Flynn mislead Congress and the American people, he also apparently deceived Vice President Mike Pence, who made false statements on Flynn’s behalf in an interview with Face the Nation.”            “At a minimum, Flynn recklessly violated the sacred principle that America only has one president at a time.  But a compelling case can also be made that Flynn violated federal law by collaborating with foreign officials while still a private citizen.”   “The American people deserve competence – not corruption – from the leaders entrusted with our national security.  They deserve to be told the truth by the men and women who advise the President.  And they deserve a full accounting of how and when President Trump’s advisors colluded with a foreign power that sought to alter the outcome of an American election.”     “For all of these reasons, President Trump should fire General Flynn.”","link","https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/representatives-lieu-and-gallego-president-trump-time-fire-general-flynn","lieu.house.gov",1275,160,313,110,2,39,2,20

This monumental waste of federal resources is wrong on all levels – strategically, morally, and from a national security perspective.  Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0 is nothing short of a strategic failure. A leaked DHS report from his own cabinet called citizenship from the banned countries an unreliable indicator of threat. If the banned countries in question are such a threat, then why does this second ban arbitrarily drop the nation of Iraq? And why does the ban go into effect on March 16th? Where’s the urgency in that? This second executive order just makes zero sense.  Trump is quick to tweet about who is American and who is un-American. As an immigrant, veteran, and member of Congress, I can tell you there is nothing more un-American than undermining our fundamental value of accepting those who are fleeing tyranny, those who want to start a better life in the United States. This order is based on bigotry and must – once again – be opposed.

Ted Lieu","2017-03-07","2017-03-07 22:03:25","Yesterday, House Republicans finally released the text of their super-secret bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now we know why they tried so hard to hide it from not only House Democrats, but also our Senate colleagues and the American people.  The bottom line is that TrumpCare is an irresponsible Republican proposal that will force most Americans to pay more for less coverage so the wealthy can get a massive tax break. Middle-class Americans will see out-of-pocket costs increase, 20 million Americans may lose their health insurance, and Medicaid will ration care, all so the top 0.1% of earners can save nearly $200,000 each on their taxes. As a result, Republicans continue to cause chaos and uncertainty in the health insurance industry and will ultimately be responsible for destroying coverage for over 156 million Americans.   In an effort to fast-track and pass this monstrosity, House Republicans have allowed for no committee meetings, mark-ups, hearings, expert testimonies, or input into how this bill will affect the cost, coverage, and access to health care. The GOP, the self-proclaimed party of fiscal responsibility, won’t even wait for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze and score the bill’s impact on our budget.   For all the complaining congressional Republicans did over the past seven years about ACA, one would think they would have developed a more robust replacement plan. America deserves better.","link","http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/322609-gop-releases-bill-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare","thehill.com",144,54,84,3,2,2,13,116

While President Trump says stuff that makes you think he may be isolationist, his actions in Syria resemble those of a war monger.  Putting our nation’s men and women in harm’s way to help assault a city in a faraway place is mission creep. It is also violates the current Authorization for Use of Military Force. When Congress passed the post-9/11 AUMF to fight Al Qaeda terrorists, it never had the intention of authorizing ground forces to help take over a city in the middle of Syria's civil war in 2017.  Today’s news also underscores the troubling fact that the President has yet to articulate a strategy or endgame for Syria. Americans are left wondering how long our service members will be deployed in a conflict zone, what will happen if they come into conflict with Russian forces operating in the region, what our Administration plans to do with Raqqa after retaking the city, and how this all fits in with our national interests.

Once again, House Republicans have rejected an effort to shed light on a possible threat to our core values as Americans. There is a reason that, time after time, President Trump’s advisors—including the Attorney General—have lied about meetings with agents of the Russian government.

Last year I traveled to South Korea, met with the Defense Minister, and visited U.S. troops serving there. After reflecting on the provocative actions and comments by the Trump Administration, I have concluded that the Administration's march toward war with North Korea is nuts.  There are no good U.S. military options for North Korea. When I served on active duty in the Air Force, I was stationed at Andersen AFB in Guam and traveled to bases in Japan and South Korea. It was clear then that any U.S. attack on North Korea could quickly escalate to an all-out war in the region, resulting in millions killed or injured. That remains the situation today.  While I agree North Korea is a threat to U.S. national security, the regime is still years away from being able to strike the U.S. homeland. War must always be the last resort. The Administration threatening a 'major conflict' and saying 'the sword stands ready' is irresponsible and can lead to catastrophic miscalculations. Instead, the Trump Administration needs to use all the levers of U.S. power, such as increased economic sanctions, and pursue further diplomacy. That requires articulating a clear and consistent strategy and fully funding the State Department—two things this Administration has unfortunately refused to do.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/29/politics/trump-face-the-nation-interview-north-korea/index.html","cnn.com",174,36,57,4,1,6,18,38

Canine experiments are unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. We owe it to not only our canine friends but our nation’s Veterans and American taxpayers to promote science that does not come at the expense of animals’ welfare.  I applaud the White Coat Waste Project for its hard work, and I look forward to continuing to make strides with my colleagues in Congress to end dog abuse across VA facilities.","link","http://blog.whitecoatwaste.org/2017/12/08/wcw-announces-2017-congressional-waste-warrior-awards/","blog.whitecoatwaste.org",331,39,31,64,0,5,0,0

The repercussions of this tax scam will be a nightmare.  We have just witnessed generational theft to benefit the super-rich and corporations. The GOP pushed through a bill that is deeply unpopular and will raise taxes on millions of middle class families.   I’m angry for Californians, who will be acutely hurt by this bill. Under this bill, my constituents who were impacted by the wildfires won’t have access to critical tax deductions meant for disaster survivors. Under this bill, my constituents on Medicare and Medicaid likely won’t see the necessary funding to keep older and low-income Americans covered. Under this bill, my constituents will basically incur double taxes because of the cut to the State and Local Tax deduction.  Today, the House and Senate GOP cast their votes in favor of hurting middle class American families so that folks with estates worth $22 million can get a massive tax exemption.","link","https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-bill-pass_us_5a395ec8e4b0c65287acc5f5?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009","huffingtonpost.com",422,254,281,6,8,5,147,850
