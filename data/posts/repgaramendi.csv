It also made it possible for individuals with early-onset Alzheimer’s to purchase affordable health insurance when they were previously denied or charged higher rates for having a pre-existing condition.

This year, it is not simply enough to praise the names of now-beloved icons like Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. It is instead important to consider how these figures were vilified in their own time so we do not repeat the same mistakes. It is not enough to read about the dream of which Doctor King so eloquently spoke; instead, we must remember that we are still very far from his promised land.  We live in an era where voting rights are under attack—where a state in this nation deliberately restricted voting hours to affect the African-American community, and admitted so in court. Black Americans still face rampant inequality and discrimination in housing, employment, education, and criminal justice. If we are truly to achieve equality, we must strive to correct these injustices.  I believe it is possible, but we have work to do.  As Tubman said, every great dream begins with a dreamer.

I am monitoring the latest developments, especially with another storm hitting today and tomorrow.  Despite the damage, there is no imminent danger to the dam itself, and water levels are being actively managed by the Department of Water Resources through timed releases. As expected, the overnight flow rate of 20,000 cubic feet per second caused additional erosion to the spillway. Engineers are on site to actively monitor the integrity of the structure. Everything is occurring as DWS expected it to, and there are currently no threats to public safety.   In case the amount of water arriving in the upcoming storm is too much to handle through these releases, DWR has a contingency plan to use an emergency spillway. Currently, the water level at Lake Oroville is about 30 feet below an unlined emergency spillway that would dump water onto unpopulated land. While this could pose problems downstream because of debris, water managers in the Feather River watershed are actively working together to create room to capture runoff in case this becomes necessary.  DWR has been clearing debris, including rocks and trees, from the hillside where the emergency spillway would flow, just in case it becomes necessary. They are also making every effort to protect fish from any harmful effects, and have been evacuating them to the Thermalito Annex.  To access the latest news about lake conditions, inflows, and outflows, call 530-534-2307 for a recorded message that will be frequently updated with the latest information.","status",NA,NA,47,18,23,0,0,3,2,1

An evacuation order is in place for Oroville and south to the Sutter County line, as well as the Marysville area, due to a hazardous situation developing with the Oroville Dam auxiliary spillway.  Operation of the auxiliary spillway has led to severe erosion that could lead to a failure of the structure, possibly resulting in an uncontrolled release of flood waters from Lake Oroville.  While Lake Oroville water levels are currently below the emergency spillway, the risk remains and the evacuation is still in effect.  To reach Yolo County’s shelter at the Yolo County Fairgrounds from I-5: take exit 537 for Main Street; turn left on E. Main Street; turn left on East Street; turn left on E. Gum Avenue. The Yolo County Fairgrounds are located at 1250 East Gum Avenue in Woodland.

Currently, I work with Habitat for Humanity’s Brush with Kindness program to help low-income families with home repairs. The impact that the families have on my self-esteem are priceless. The thanks that I receive from the dozen families I’ve helped are never ending. I feel incredibly proud about my work with AmeriCorps, and when the children of these families walk by as I work on their homes with huge smiles on their faces it brings everything home for me. The best part is that I get to go home to my own children and tell them how I helped a family feel pride in their home again.

FoodCorps is a part of the AmeriCorps network and helps connect kids with local healthy food:   ""Having FoodCorps Service members serving in our schools in Calaveras Unified schools the last 4 years has had a tremendously positive impact on improving students knowledge of the importance of good nutrition and food awareness.  As we battle a growing obesity epidemic in our rural, low-income areas,  this is more important now than ever.  Our FoodCorps members have been champions promoting the connection between growing food, eating well and living a healthy lifestyle.  They have generated excitement and enthusiasm around our school gardens as they have worked with children of all ages planting the seeds, cultivating, weeding and ultimately enjoying the fruits (and vegetables) of their hard work. They are inspiring more teachers and parents to get involved in the projects and take ownership in the gardens, and in the nutrition education for their students.  Hundreds of students, families and community members are benefiting in an incredibly profound way with improving their consumption of healthy foods, their feeling of place at school sites and in their desire to come to school and be engaged in these activities. FoodCorps has also been able to bring a diversity of stakeholders together in our community, helping us all work towards a common goal of making our schools healthy and thriving places to learn, eat and connect with nature and food.  FoodCorps, and Americorps are bringing very valuable resources into rural communities, like Calaveras County, that are making lasting and sustainable changes that are improving the health of these communities in many ways.  It is essential that these programs continue to be funded, so that these services for the children and families continue to thrive, and opportunities for young people to learn skills and become change agents in our communities, leading to a lifetime of being contributing members to our society, continues to be a part of what makes our nation so amazing and wonderful.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repgaramendi/photos/a.10150153139256747.282817.182567716746/10154652200701747/?type=3",NA,43,0,7,2,0,0,0,0

It is cruel. I simply cannot believe that something this bad could pass the House of Representatives, but it has.  “This bill will strip 24 million people of their health insurance. It is a crushing age tax for Americans of 50-64 years of age, and will force them to pay up to five times as much as what a 30-year-old would pay for the same coverage. It will destabilize funding for Medicare, taking $75 billion out of the trust fund, and blow a $10 billion annual hole in MediCal. It will practically eliminate the guarantee of coverage for pre-existing conditions, which could affect over 300,000 people in my district. But it will provide a massive, $600 billion tax cut to America’s richest. It is an outright assault on the poor and the sick, and a huge transfer of wealth to the rich. Even worse, the Republican majority rushed to a vote on it without giving the Congressional Budget Office a chance to tell us just how bad it is.  “I served for eight years as the Insurance Commissioner of California. I know exactly what insurance companies will do under policies that gives them free rein, and that’s what this bill does. The amendments that were put on this bill at the last second do nothing to reduce the devastation it will impose on America’s most vulnerable. It is a sad day in Congress.”","link","http://garamendi.house.gov/press-release/congressman-garamendi-s-statement-repeal-affordable-care-act","garamendi.house.gov",311,77,251,5,2,6,89,105

It is a cruel departure from the solid, bipartisan approach Congress took in passing the omnibus bill just three weeks ago—a bill that preserved funding for science, supported search for cures, and protected our nation’s most vulnerable people.  This new proposal takes this Administration’s attack on America’s most vulnerable to new heights. It includes a 20% cut to the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides affordable health care to America’s poorest children. It cuts Medicaid by an additional $610 billion on top of the $880 billion included in the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It also harms public health. This proposal would cut funding for the National Institute of Health by nearly $7 billion, severely damaging our ability to find cures to diseases like Alzheimer’s. This bill would also hurt our efforts to build a clean energy economy, gutting $1.4 billion from the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program.  But even as this budget causes direct harm to the poor, the vulnerable, and the middle class, it provides massive tax giveaways to America’s wealthiest that will blow a massive hole in the deficit—a hallmark of the Trump Administration. But they simply assume the math will add up by making wildly unrealistic assumptions about economic growth.

Whether it’s providing aid, educating a community, or negotiating peaceful resolutions to foreign conflicts, the Peace Corps has a demonstrable benefit in every community it reaches. I am proud to stand with the Peace Corps, and will continue to fight for the program in Congress.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/us/politics/questions-on-trump-peace-corps-volunteers-change-the-topic.html","nytimes.com",139,29,45,16,0,5,41,11

California’s seniors aren’t getting a fair Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) in their Social Security checks. Sadly, that’s forcing many of our seniors to take out predatory high-interest “payday” loans that have a long history of trapping Americans in debt. It shouldn’t have to come to this—there’s a very easy step we can take to ensure COLAs keep up to pace with the rising living costs for our seniors. It’s a bill I introduced called the Fair COLA Act of 2017.   This bill would tie COLA calculations to a Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) that actually reflects how retirees spend their money—especially in healthcare and housing. Currently, the COLA calculation is based on the living standards for younger, urban wage earners who spend their money much differently than retirees. Seniors and retirees deserve to have a program that evolves along with their cost of living, and Congress can take a very simple step to make that a reality.","link","http://www.dailynews.com/article/20170710/NEWS/170719946","dailynews.com",155,46,61,7,0,4,70,56

In Congress, it's critically important to pursue policies that protect and expand the services Social Security provides for our seniors. That's why I introduced the Fair COLA Act of 2017.

The people in DACA came to America as children. For many of them, America is the only home they’ve ever known. The people in DACA did what was asked of them. They came out of the shadows. They signed up. They got in line. They went through a thorough background check. They can work, pay taxes and support their families. It would set a terrible precedent to betray their trust. Instead of tearing families apart, let’s focus on keeping America safe.  To the many people now living in fear, worried about the future of DACA, I want you to know that Congress is full of people like me who will do everything we can to keep you safe. That’s why I am cosponsoring the American Hope Act, which would protect DACA-registered immigrants from harassment.","status",NA,NA,258,59,33,27,1,2,7,1

Residents on the west side of Interstate 80 should be prepared to evacuate if it becomes necessary.  We are receiving an overwhelming amount of calls into our Fairfield PD Dispatch center from residents with questions about evacuations.  All information regarding evacuations will be disseminated through Nixle as well as posted on our Facebook and Twitter pages.  We are asking residents not to call our Dispatch center to advise that they are evacuating.  If you have not already signed up to receive Nixle alerts please text only your zip code to 888777.  This will automatically add you to the distribution list.  Texting any more than that prohibits the system from adding your contact information to the list.  If you do have questions about the fire and/or evacuations that have not been answered by our news releases please call (707) 428-7320.   For those residents who have voluntarily left their homes, the evacuation center at Solano Community College is open and accepting evacuees.  A new evacuation center has been opened at Fairfield High School, 205 E. Atlantic Avenue.  The center at Alan Witt Park has reached capacity and re-directing residents to the college and Fairfield High School. Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District buses are staging at B Gale Wilson school, 3301 Cherry Hills Court, for those needing a ride to Fairfield High School.    A map of the area for the City of Fairfield that is currently under evacuation notice has been attached.  For information regarding areas within Solano County under evacuation notice please visit the Solano County Sheriff’s Facebook page.  In an effort to clarify the terms that have been used regarding evacuations, and hopefully answer questions for our residents, we have put together the following list:  Mandatory Evacuation: This is a warning to persons within the designated area that an imminent threat to life and property exists and individuals MUST evacuate in accordance with the instructions of local officials.  Voluntary Evacuation: This is a warning to persons within a designated area that a threat to life and property exists or is likely to exist in the immediate future. Individuals issued this type of warning are NOT required to evacuate; however, it would be to their advantage to do so.  Advisory: This is not an evacuation order.  It is a notice that residents should begin to prepare to evacuate should the need arise.  We are suggesting that residents who live in communities that are under advisory begin to pack necessary items such as medication, clothing, and any other items they would want to leave with if the need arises.   Many residents and businesses have been contacting the police department to ask how to make donations to residents and first responders.  The outpouring of support while greatly appreciated, is not needed at this time.  We are asking that all donations be made to the Red Cross.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/FairfieldPolice/photos/a.10150248688785307.470024.252571000306/10159337417615307/?type=3",NA,38,4,0,0,0,14,30,0

FEMA has a strong track record of providing emergency services and relief in disaster situations. But their record of maintaining those resources and support over the long term is often mired with issues. The State of California alone is still owed over $4 billion in funding that the federal government has promised to commit to help the state respond to natural disasters. Some of these IOU’s date back almost 20 years.   This issue of long-term disaster relief funding is created by the way Congress manages FEMA’s spending. Under the current funding structure, once the Disaster Relief Fund that FEMA utilizes to provide disaster relief is diminished, FEMA can only afford to provide relief to immediate disasters. Congress must fund the Disaster Relief Fund at an adequate level now to ensure FEMA has the resources it needs to provide relief to communities that have been devastated by a natural disaster from day one and beyond.","link","http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/video/3750453-mounting-disasters-strain-femas-ability-to-deliver-promised-relief/","sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com",50,23,25,1,0,2,26,13

The tax plan also robs nearly $2 trillion in Medicare and Medicaid funding in order to pay for these tax breaks for the super wealthy, and blows a multi-trillion dollar hole in the deficit.  Simply put: This tax plan is a disaster for working men and women.
