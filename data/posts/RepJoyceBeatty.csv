Trump, yet again, vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, create countless new jobs and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Unfortunately, he provided few details on how he and Congressional Republicans would pursue and enact such sweeping policies. Some seven years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, Republicans and the Trump Administration have no comprehensive plan to expand affordable, high-quality healthcare to more people without jeopardizing the livelihood of more than 22 million newly-insured Americans. Moreover, I heard nothing remotely resembling a ‚Äòjobs plan,‚Äô and on investing in infrastructure‚Äîa proposal Democrats have fought for for the last decade‚Äîit remains to be seen if the very same Republicans who refused to increase infrastructure funding for years are now prepared to do an about-face. #JointSession","status",NA,NA,73,13,9,5,0,0,1,0
