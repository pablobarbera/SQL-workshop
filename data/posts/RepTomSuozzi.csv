Even in the middle of the down-to-the-wire state budget negotiations, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was willing to go another round in the acrimonious battle with Reps. John Faso and Chris Collins.  Cuomo found time Thursday to hold a conference call with four Democrats in the state‚Äôs congressional delegation to talk about Medicaid and to advocate for federal legislation that would bring more money from Washington for Medicaid.  Rep. Eliot Engel, who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, said the bill, called the Empire State Equity Act, would increase federal funding to New York by $2.3 billion. Not coincidently, that‚Äôs the exact amount that would have been shifted from New York‚Äôs counties to Albany if last week‚Äôs controversial amendment by Faso and Collins had been passed as part of the American Health Care Act.  Now Engel, along with Reps. Paul Tonko, Sean Patrick Maloney and Long Island‚Äôs Thomas Suozzi, are also proposing relieving that county burden. Unlike their GOP counterparts, however, they propose that Washington, not Albany, would pick up the tab.  Even the congressmen admit that it would be tough to pass such a bill, but that wasn‚Äôt really the point. Instead, this was a chance for Cuomo and others to again talk about how New York gives more than it gets when it comes to money to Washington. He called the Faso-Collins amendment a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù and argued that the new bill would allow for ‚Äúfairness,‚Äù and ultimately for counties across the state to reduce the property tax burden.  It also would challenge Collins and Faso, along with other GOP members of the state delegation, to side with the home counties or the Washington budget cutters.  The half-hour conference call provided a chance for Cuomo and Suozzi to applaud one another. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one person who understands property tax issues, it‚Äôs Andrew Cuomo,‚Äù Suozzi said. ‚ÄúHe gets this issue.‚Äù  And then, moments later, came words of praise from Cuomo. Suozzi, the governor said, had ‚Äúlived this issue‚Äù as Nassau County executive and as the head of a state commission whose goal was to find ways to reduce property taxes. Said Cuomo: ‚ÄúHis help is going to help us all.‚Äù  Randi F.

We left the Capitol at 5am this morning, flew on a military plane to Guantanamo, and received a tour of the detention facilities. The  41 detainees include, among others, the masterminds behind the 9/11 and USS Cole terrorist attacks - these murderers include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.   GTMO has held over 700 detainees since 9/11 and now holds 41. 7 of these enemy combatants are now engaged in a lengthy military tribunal process, are represented by counsel (which the United States funds millions per year on their behalf) and are treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. 3 detainees have already been convicted and the remainder continue to be detained under the ""laws of war.""  This is a serious and costly operation with no easy answers. This issue poses many public policy questions, but it is apparent why President Obama was unable to completely close the facility.  Americans don't want detainees in their back yards. The military tribunals must be held in facilities that can handle top secret information due  to its sensitive classified nature that may be disclosed during the trial process. The process may take many more years due to the legal wrangling. Some of the detainees are an incredibly high security risk. Yet, some including former General Petraeus, believe the facility should be closed because it serves as a great propaganda and recruiting tool for our enemies. We do hold other terrorists in America that have been convicted already.   I am heading back to the Capitol for votes tonight, but I would like to know what do you think?

There are almost 100 known terrorist organizations in the world and as many as 20% are organizing and operating in Afghanistan. The terrorists must be disrupted here so they cannot plot to once again attack in Europe and the US.  Train, Advise and Assist is the US mission to enable the Afghanistan (and other) military to defeat these enemies. ""By, with and through"" their efforts we will defeat these criminals/terrorists.  There is a cap on the number of US personnel. We are below 10,000 whereas years ago we were over 100,000.  Challenges remain:     1) Corruption in the Afghan Forces which the Afghani government with our assistance is making some positive headway,     2) Tribalism, where some groups are more loyal to their local tribe than to their nation. This is a work in progress as the Afghans try and build a nation and a sense of nationalism.      3) the terrorists/criminals fund their operations as the largest grower of poppy (used to make heroin) in the world. The heroin in America does not come from Afghanistan, but 80% of Canada's supply comes from here, as does Iran's (Iran should wake up to their own self interest and help destroy these poppy fields).    4) the border with Pakistan is ungoverned and porous. Terrorists roam freely from Pakistan in to Afghanistan regularly. Pakistan's military must do a better job helping out. (In a later post I will discuss Nangdahar Province where the MOAB was dropped to help fortify the border and defeat ISIS).  Our military is on an important and often misunderstood mission. I am so impressed by their intelligence, courage and the responsible way in which they are conducting their mission. They need our help, support and understanding.  There are enemies/criminals/terrorists who will take a generation to defeat. We must enlist and enable other local populations who we will,  ""by, with and through"" their efforts, defeat this scourge on humankind.  The answers will not come through killing the enemy as the only strategy, but it is an essential piece. I will discuss this more in future posts.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/videos/250742068731221/",NA,83,15,5,5,0,1,0,0

We flew overnight from Bagram to Kuwait on a C-130 (not much sleep).  Ambassador Llorens and his team and General Nicholson and his team both gave excellent accounts of what has happened in Afghanistan over the past 15 years and the plan moving ahead as well as the political dynamic with President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah.  There is a clear 4 year plan to further empower the Afghani Army, Air Force, Special Forces and Police, and to persuade Pakistan to take a more positive role. The plan on the civil side is less defined. I think there needs to be a commensurate 4 year plan regarding infrastructure, energy, education and economic development.  The border with Pakistan must be secured and the terrorist/criminal forces in previously ""forbidden forests"" (my phrase) must be routed out (hence the MOAB).

The photo of the bombed out concrete hanger below is a remnant of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the early '90's. Kuwait remains an excellent ally, that like the UAE and Jordan, are reliable friends that encourage US presence and serve as bases to access the entire region - especially Iraq and Syria.  We first met with Marine command that focuses on, among other things, the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel. We toured the Osprey (with helicopter and fixed wing airplane capability) that are used for those operations. We met with the commander's innovation team which is utilizing 3D printers in the field to create tools and spare parts in theatre (impressive) and had lunch with soldiers from Long Island and discussed some of the challenges they face.  We then moved by van to Camp Arifjan for some intense briefings from Army Central Command, the Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve and Special Operations regarding the strategy and operations in Iraq and Syria. (Sorry, no pictures).  Tremendous progress is being made in Iraq ""by, with and through"" the Iraqis. Our military has a well thought out plan for the Iraqi's to retake Mosul, which will deliver a major blow to the ISIS caliphate in Iraq.  Syria is incredibly complex with 7 major players in addition to the terrorists/criminals 1) Assad, 2) the Russians, 3) the Iranians, 4) the revolutionaries, 5) the Kurds, 6) the Turks (who don't trust the Kurds), and 7) the US.  Arguably, as the US, and our allies help defeat ISIS, we are helping Assad, Russia and Iran who also oppose ISIS. The goal is to retake Raqqah which is the hub of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. We should be looking for something in return from Iran and Russia as we help accomplish their mutual goal in defeating ISIS.  I supported the Syrian Air Base strike in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons, but the time has come for the president to layout a long term plan that seeks bipartisan support for congress.  We also met with the US Ambassador to Kuwait Larry Silverman and Kuwaiti officials to discuss the region.  1) we cannot relent on ISIS, AQ and any other terrorist/criminal organization that seeks to export their violence to the west and our land,  2) we should ramp up our ""by, with and through"" strategy that empowers local governments to police their own lands (we do not want to be an occupying force - we can't afford it from a human or monetary perspective and it will not work).  3) we should bring together Muslim allies like Kuwait, Jordan, the UAE and others from the region, as well as Muslims from Indonesia, Malaysia and elsewhere who oppose the criminals/terrorists to present the true picture of Islam and their opposition to our common enemies.  4) we must have a commensurate, long term civil response that encourages economic development, education and cooperation with our Muslim friends that empowers them to overcome the criminals.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/photos/a.190004248138337.1073741828.189976864807742/251839918621436/?type=3",NA,43,3,0,1,0,1,0,0

Unlike portrayals in movies and on TV, I find that our military and special forces execute their duties carefully, responsibly and with close attention to their legal authority.   Later at Al Dafra Air Force Base it became apparent how close a relationship we enjoy with the UAE. The facilities and proposed upgrades are a good indication of what a great ally they are.  The Air Force has 5 missions and Al Dafra has aircraft needed to help fulfill each mission in the entire region 1) Air and Space Superiority, 2) intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, 3) Rapid Global Mobility, 4) Global Strike and 5) Command and Control.  We toured the air base, met with soldiers, received intense classified briefings. I especially enjoyed touring the humongous tanker aircraft that carry up to 590,000 tons of fuel and cargo and perform mid air refueling of all types of aircraft so they can cover long distances from the air base to the theatre of operation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/photos/a.198981707240591.1073741829.189976864807742/252306621908099/?type=3",NA,61,7,4,1,0,1,0,0

Tom Suozzi","2017-04-21","2017-04-21 12:31:27","Afghanistan, Kuwait, UAE and Jordan - Part 12 - Final  This is my last post regarding the bipartisan CODEL to this region. Below are pictures of the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, and our meeting with the US Ambassador there. We did not have the time to go inside or do any touristy type stops. Our final stop in Jordan (one of our closest allies) was equally informative, but I never had the chance to take any photos with the Ambassador or military personnel. Jordan remains central to our US strategy in the Middle East. It shares borders with Syria, Iraq, Israel and Saudia Arabia. It has enormous pressure from the 1.3 million Syrian refugees who now call it home. It's central location, 150,000 troops, long and trusted relationship and role in Jerusalem make Jordan one of our most important allies.  7 final points:  1) I have always supported our troops, but I have new and deeper admiration for our military men and women. The intelligence, courage and responsible way they execute their duties is sobering, humbling and inspiring. I am so impressed by the leadership cadre and the scores that fill the ranks. God bless them, guide them and keep them safe.  2) I have always tried to stay informed, but I have a new understanding of the complexity of our involvement in this region. Yet I have a deep appreciation of the merit and simplicity of America's ""by, with and through"" strategy that seeks to empower local forces, and de-risk our personnel, while shouldering our burden to defeat the existential threat of the criminals/terrorists that would do us and the world order harm.  3) we must protect our diplomatic corps and their funding. President Trump's proposed cuts to the State Department are reckless, uninformed and irresponsible. Our diplomatic personnel are also intelligent, courageous and responsible in the execution of their duties and they are equally responsible for our long term success.  4) killing our enemies is sadly a necessary part of our strategy, but it can never be the final answer to our generational threat we face from the criminals/terrorists that are manically set upon killing and intimidating us. We must also help our friends and allies build the competence to  protect themselves and provide a sustainable quality of life for their people.  5) we must help those in the 1.5 billion of the Muslim world who join with us in the condemnation of the criminal/terrorist adulteration of Islam to stand together in solidarity against this existential scourge.  6) politicians need to put aside the petty political games and recognize the serious import of the jobs we have. We must work together to solve problems and get things done.  7) I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/photos/a.198981707240591.1073741829.189976864807742/252893151849446/?type=3",NA,51,7,3,0,0,3,0,0

Met with the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Goldfein and his senior staff. Interesting conversation about readiness. The Air Force was much bigger in 1991, but equipment is much more modernized and threats are different. I asked for follow up information on condition of the equipment.  Also met with the Pakistani Ambassador,  Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry. I discussed with him the concern of policy and military experts regarding Pakistan's obligation to quash the terrorists operating within their borders and crossing into Afghanistan and elsewhere. I also discussed the concerns my constituents have regarding Kashmir and the lack of interest by American experts, because of their bigger concern about terrorism on the Western border and elsewhere. Everyone I have spoken with thinks Pakistan must do a better job.  The Ambassador countered that Pakistan has gone after terrorism aggressively over the past 4 years as demonstrated by 1) the reduction of terrorist events from over 100 per month to less than 5 per month in Pakistan, 2) the return of residents to previously ""ungoverned areas"" because of government intervention, and 3) Pakistan's establishment of better border controls along the Afghanistan border.  I made it clear that I want to be helpful. I have many Pakistani American constituents, as well as many Indian American residents, and my main goal is to try and do the right thing to decrease violence, promote understanding and human dignity, and to root out terrorism.  The Ambassador invited me and other Congress members to visit the region to see things first hand.  I had one more interesting brief meeting outside the house chamber to discuss environmental concerns.  Look at the pictures. Do you know who that other meeting was with?","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/photos/a.198981707240591.1073741829.189976864807742/266922303779864/?type=3",NA,74,8,2,2,0,0,0,0

My vision for the Glen Cove waterfront was always a ferry. Actually had one when I was mayor in 2001.  It was run by Foxwoods who wanted ferry to casinos. As part of the deal I required that they also do commute to NYC.  On 9/11/01 we evacuated thousands from Manhattan and were prepared to bring medical and emergency personnel into the city, but sadly they were not needed, as few survived.  The ferry which was struggling financially (fuel costs and personnel) was commandeered to take commuters from NJ that were displaced because PATH train was disrupted. The ferry stopped operating from Glen Cove.  As County Executive and Chairman of the NY Metropolitan Transportation Council I helped include millions in the Transportation Improvement Plan for the Glen Cove Ferry Terminal.  Out of the chaos of Penn station has come this blessing. Let's hope these next few months help deliver a sustainable plan.

While he may be trying to divert attention from his recent controversies, America's strategy for Afghanistan under this administration is past due and must be disclosed.  Here is what I am hoping the president says tonight. ""Based upon consultation with military and diplomatic experts in my administration, I believe we must increase the number of troops engaged in the ""Train, Advise and Assist"" mission in Afghanistan by 3,000.""  Below is a more detailed explanation of my position.  I traveled to Afghanistan this spring and reported on it extensively on this page.  I have discussed with the US Commander in Afghanistan, General Nicholson, his proposed strategy during my trip. In my capacity as a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, I have met with and questioned Secretary of Defense Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford on this same topic. I have spoken with numerous other military officials in both Afghanistan and here in the US on this topic. I have also discussed this issue with diplomats in the State Department and intelligence officials.  Several points are important to make clear:  1) At least a dozen of the over 60 terrorist organizations in the world operate out of Afghanistan.  2) We have remained in Afghanistan for over 15 years because we cannot allow the terrorist organizations operating there to have any respite. They will use Afghanistan for training and for planning further coordinated attacks in Europe and the US.  3) We have drawn down the number of US troops from a peak of over 100,000 to about 8,500 troops today.  4) The primary US mission is to train, advise and assist the Afghan Army so that they may take the fight to the enemy and ""by, with and through them"" the enemy will be defeated.  5) There is currently a 5-point plan in Afghanistan; i) train, advise and assist the Afghan army, ii) train, advise and assist the Afghan Special Forces, iii) train, advise and assist the Afghan Air Force and help build it to effectively coordinate with the Army, iv) help train the local police force, and v) get Pakistan to a better job securing its borders and going after terrorists that operate within Pakistan and ply the porous borders between the two countries. This plan should continue.  6) The US needs a commensurate Civil/State Department driven plan and any plan for Afghanistan must consider the entire region, especially, but not limited to Pakistan and Iran.  Every expert I have spoken with has made a persuasive case that 1) we cannot leave Afghanistan, 2) we should maintain our Train, Assist and Advise/By, With and Through Strategy, 3) Afghanistan's government is making progress rooting out corruption (but still has a long way to go) and promoting a sense of nationalism over tribalism, and 4) we must put more pressure on Pakistan to cooperate.  More specifically, the purpose of increasing the number of troops is to provide ""force protection"" to our own existing troops. We need troops, not to further engage the enemy - which is now limited to our special forces and our troops only when they are engaged by the enemy - but to protect our Armed Services when they are deployed to Train, Advise and Assist the Afghanis. These additional troops would also be used to replace expensive private contractors that are currently used to protect our bases in Afghanistan.   It is everyone's natural inclination, including mine, to say ""this has gone on much too long, let's bring our troops home,"" and ""we have spent too much blood and treasure already on the ungovernable part of the world.""  However, I believe the sad reality is that we are in a long term battle in a changed world and until Afghanistan can govern itself (which must be the goal), we must do everything we can to help disrupt these terrorist organizations so they cannot organize and attempt to harm Americans or our friends in Europe and Eastern Europe. The long term solution cannot be to simply kill our enemies, but we must in the meanwhile prevent them from purveying their sinister hate, anarchy and criminality throughout the world. This increase, of what I hope will be about 3,000 troops, is unfortunately a necessary part of achieving our long term goals and restoring order.","status",NA,NA,100,64,8,1,0,0,0,1

Partisanship is caused because over 400 of the 435 seats in The House of Representatives are ""safe"" seats.  If you are a Republican in a Republican safe seat or a Democrat in a Democratic safe seat, you can't lose the general election. You can only lose a primary.   Few people vote in primaries (often under 10% of the registered voters in each party) and the few that do vote are often far to the right for Republicans and far to the left for Democrats. So incumbents in safe seats spend a great deal of effort pleasing the base of their party faithful that vote in primaries.  It gets very difficult to compromise if you are set on only pleasing your base.  The only way to solve this problem is to have less safe seats. The only way to have less safe seats is to get rid of partisan gerrymandering. One of the only ways to get rid of partisan gerrymandering is to have the Supreme Court declare it unconstitutional.  I am one of 36 members and former members of Congress (half Dems and half Reps) that have signed on to a ""friend of the Court) brief to be argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

The President announced yesterday that he is suspending the ""cost sharing"" subsidies that hold down consumer costs for insurance in the ""individual market."" This will cause the costs in the individual market (which has already been destabilized by uncertainty) to skyrocket and for more insurers to pull out. That is why the Problem Solvers bi-partisan proposal is more important now then ever.  A little detail: The 330 million Americans all get health insurance different ways. Some none at all. 160 million get their insurance from their employers. 70 million from Medicare, 50 million from Medicaid, 25-30 million remain uninsured and 20 million from the individual market. All the horror stories about skyrocketing premiums and insurers pulling out are related to the individual market - these are often individuals, sole proprietors, and small businesses.  The bipartisan proposal by the Problem Solvers Caucus included a plan to prop up this market and actually reduce premiums, deductibles and copays. This is the same issue that Senators Lamar Alexander (R) and Patty Murray (D) have been working on.  The President's action will cause tremendous turmoil and increased costs. The Senate and the House must enact a bipartisan solution or many more people will be hurt.  It is very complex, but this will really have negative consequences for real people.  http://www.newsday.com/beta/news/nation/trump-to-halt-obamacare-subsidy-payments-to-insurers-1.14450420","link","http://www.newsday.com/beta/news/nation/trump-to-halt-obamacare-subsidy-payments-to-insurers-1.14450420","newsday.com",88,164,67,0,2,2,23,171

I am in favor of simplifying the tax code. I am in favor of reducing costs for middle class families.   I am opposed to:    1) eliminating the State and Local Tax deduction (it is non-negotiable and will devastate NY taxpayers),   2) eliminating the estate tax, which would blow a hole in the budget and increase the deficit,   3) reducing the pass through tax rate down to 25%. If someone makes $500,000 or $1,000,000 or more from a Subchapter S or LLC, why should they pay only 25% tax rate,   4) eliminating or reducing the 401(k) retirement savings deduction.

The South Koreans have managed to create a democratic, economically successful country that respects the rule of law. They have accomplished all this despite North Korea‚Äôs threats for over 60 years. They are now the 11th largest economy in the world (think Samsung and Hyundai) and have transformed from an aid receiving country to an aid giver in less than a generation.  South Korea is not only a strategic ally and one of our largest trading partners, our military bases there provide access (along with Japan) to the entire Indo Pacific region.  North Korea is a totalitarian economically depressed country that inspires its citizens to risk their lives to defect. The soldier that was shot 5 times by his fellow North Korean soldiers trying to defect 10 days ago was operated on and the doctors found foot long worms in his stomach from malnutrition and poor hygiene. The North Korean people are oppressed, economically deprived and force-fed the propaganda that their ‚ÄúSupreme Leader‚Äù is divine.  It is clear who the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù and who the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù are here. The challenge is to stop the North Korean bad actors from continuing their nuclear proliferation.  The good news is that we have a highly capable American military team partnered with a capable and committed South Korean team. The world‚Äôs nations are largely on board with isolating the North Koreans. China has outsized economic influence and have the ability to affect North Koreans behavior if they so choose.  The South Korean people have been polled and over 70% don‚Äôt believe there will be a military conflict. Their lack of anxiety should help us to stay strong and persevere. We must continue to isolate the North Koreans and use economic pressure to persuade them to alter their current course.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/photos/a.198981707240591.1073741829.189976864807742/346987052440055/?type=3",NA,213,28,3,3,0,0,2,0

This bill takes more from New Yorkers (higher taxes) to subsidize other states,    2) every Republican and every Democratic member of Congress from Long Island and NYC voted no on this tax plan (bipartisan disapproval) - its bad for us, taxes will go up and home values will go down,    3) the last time there was a major tax plan in the 1980‚Äôs it was a two year process, this effort took 6 weeks - no one knows the impact of the many particulars of this plan,     4) Democrats were not included in the process, no hearings, no amendments, no negotiations.  I will continue trying to build relationships and work with others to try and get things done. My goal will also be to WIN. And if we win, I will try and work with others to get things done to benefit the people I serve.   PS the deficit is a major problem","status",NA,NA,299,145,80,2,1,2,32,76

I am honored and humbled to serve as a United States Congressman.  There is a great deal of work to do in the year ahead.  I am seriously disappointed in the new tax law recently signed into law. I will work to undo it‚Äôs  deficiencies (especially the elimination of the State and Local Tax deduction and the elimination of the individual mandate) and address those issues that remained unaddressed (especially the closing of corporate loopholes that encourage foreign investment, the closing of the carried interest loophole, and the failure to link corporate tax reform to middle class job creation). I will fight against any efforts to undermine Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid now that the federal deficit has been irresponsibly increased.  I will continue to work to address climate change, to preserve and protect our environment, to push for comprehensive immigration reform, to enhance health care access for all Americans, to fight against partisan gerrymandering and to restore net neutrality.   I will continue to do everything I can for our veterans (especially at the Northport VA and fighting for mental health care).  I will fight  to rebuild middle class jobs and wages and push to enhance high skilled and high tech industry on Long Island and Queens. I will continue to work to protect and try to enhance the Long Island Sound and to fight for those plagued by airplane and helicopter noise.  I will continue to work hard and push the cleanup of the Navy Grumman plume and to improve the King‚Äôs Point Merchant Marine Academy. I will work hard to promote a massive investment in our nation‚Äôs infrastructure (including sewer and water infrastructure).  I have learned so much on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees and I will always fight for a strong military AND a strong diplomatic corps. I will work to route out waste, fraud and abuse in our Department of Defense and State Department budgets while fighting to protect the vital roles they play in the efforts to protect our nation and to promote world peace and stability.  I will continue to try and reach across the aisle to try and find common ground whenever possible, but I will not compromise my values.  We will continue to provide excellent constituent services, to hold monthly town hall meetings, to communicate regularly and provide access to the people I serve.  I am grateful to my staff for their continued hard work, loyalty and dedication.  I will continue to work hard, to listen to my constituents and to try and learn as much as possible so that I may be of service to the people I represent and our country.  Thank you for this opportunity and Happy New Year!!!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi/photos/a.198981707240591.1073741829.189976864807742/360430754429018/?type=3",NA,403,85,10,22,0,0,1,0
