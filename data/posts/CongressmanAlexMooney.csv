President Trump is fulfilling his promise to grow the economy by putting American jobs and energy needs first. I appreciate that President Trump mentioned the rebounding coal industry and specifically West Virginia in his speech.""  “We are seeing an end to an era where foreign anti-job, anti-energy policies, pushed by former President Barack Obama, crush West Virginian jobs. I am proud to have stood with President Trump as he fulfilled his promise to put American jobs first.”  The emissions standards and regulatory requirements under the Paris Accord would cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion over the next several decades while also destroying 6.5 million industrial sector jobs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanAlexMooney/photos/a.671870099598753.1073741832.671413332977763/1255223584596732/?type=3",NA,110,137,35,14,1,0,8,149
