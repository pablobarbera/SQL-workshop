Regardless of political party, income, race, religion, or gender we all want to know more than anything that our loved ones are safe.  When difficult times come we need to know we will have access to the health care we need to take care of our family.  It is not surprising there is so much anger, concern, and fear over our country’s health care system.  While some people are angry because changes to their health plan have left them with coverage they cannot afford, others are scared because after finally having health insurance for the first time in years they fear it will be taken away.  Both scenarios leave us feeling helpless.

Please read my full thoughts below:  Last night, President Trump stood before the American people and elected officials representing all corners of our country, promising to be the president for all people living in this great country. Out of all his campaign promises, this is the one he cannot fail to deliver on.   I am hearing from and talking to people across Washington’s Eighth District every day. I’ve heard their sincere hopes and I’ve heard their genuine fears. I can see it in their eyes and feel it in their voices.   There are deep divisions in our country, and those divisions are driven by passion and concern. We have seen it in the rifts between law enforcement and community. We have seen it in protests within our cities, on our TVs, and across the dinner table at family meals.   Bridging the divide begins and ends with rebuilding trust between one another. While we may never agree on all policy proposals, we must look for areas where we can find common ground and remind ourselves that in the end, we are all on the same team.  I am confident Congress and the White House can begin working toward uniting the country by treating one another with civility and respect and implementing policy solutions that better the lives of all Americans.   Families in Washington’s Eighth Congressional District deserve affordable, accessible, and personalized health care. American families deserve a simpler, fairer tax code that allows them to bring home more of their hard-earned dollars. They deserve an economy where determination and sweat can lead to boundless opportunities. And, they deserve to live in neighborhoods where they know their loved ones are safe. These are human desires that are blind to class, color, and geography.  As we work toward these goals, I remain willing to work with all sides, but will also be ready to speak out when I feel Congress or the Administration are taking the country in the wrong direction.   When I was first sworn into office in 2005, I swore to protect the U.S. Constitution. That is a promise I have not forgotten and one I hold dear. The President took that same oath when he was inaugurated this past January. He must look to this document as a guide to his platform and a check on his executive authority.   During this new Congress and Administration we will continue to face challenges, but these challenges are also opportunities. I look forward – with optimism and energy – to working with the constituents of Washington’s Eighth District, Congress, and the Administration to find solutions that unite us as a country and better the lives of our families.","link","http://reichert.house.gov/press-release/reichert-statement-president-trumps-joint-address-congress","reichert.house.gov",127,155,14,11,3,1,8,38

I know firsthand how important community policing is to reducing crime, keeping officers safe, and building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Today members of law enforcement around the country are being asked to take on more while facing widespread staffing shortages. Our local law enforcement are our first line of defense, the first to respond to acts of domestic terrorism. We must support the men and women who risk their lives daily to keep our communities and our families safe.  There is no greater way to do this than through strong support of the COPS Office and community policing.

Rosa, who is now 16, had Angelica when she was only 14 years-old. Although she faced criticism from her peers, did not receive support from her whole family, and understood that having a child would create challenges never faced by most 14 year-olds, Rosa decided to keep her baby. This morning at a Committee hearing, Rosa spoke about how proud she was to be a mother of a beautiful little girl, but also shared with members the life-changing experience of working with Beth Russell, a local nurse she was connected with through the Nurse Family Partnership program.  The home visits Rosa received helped her gain confidence as a first-time mom and provided the support she needed to continue her school work. I am proud Members on both sides of the aisle understand what a difference programs like the Nurse-Family Partnership, supported by the federal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program,  make for young mothers who are trying to do the best they can to prepare for motherhood and care for their child.

This is an important show of support for the more than 21,000 officers who have given their lives while serving their communities. I hope the President will take this opportunity to recognize the difficulties and dangers that officers encounter every day in public service to us all. The men and women who wear the badge understand the dangers of their job, but they heed the call to serve and willingly face those risks every day in order to create safe communities for all Americans. Peace Officers Memorial Day is the perfect time to honor these great sacrifices made by those who wear the uniform.

Some believe Congress should focus on other, more pressing issues while others are demanding we forcibly release the President’s returns.   I strongly encourage President Trump to release his tax returns. I said so during his presidential campaign and still believe he should.  But, in America all citizens' tax returns are protected by law, just as our homes are protected from unwarranted searches and seizures. The law clearly states tax returns shall be confidential (26 U.S.C. 6103) and campaign traditions do not supersede those rights. Not following the law sets a bad precedent that could threaten the privacy of all American taxpayers.   I opposed efforts in Congress to forcibly release the President’s returns because it would require an abuse of the authority given to the Ways and Means Committee. The powerful oversight tools given to the Committee should only be used to ensure that our tax code is being properly administered by the IRS – not to go on fishing expeditions for political purposes. If Congress begins to use its powers to rummage around in the tax returns of the President, what prevents Congress from doing the same to average Americans? The Ways and Means Committee has never been in the business of targeting the tax returns of single individuals – and we are not about to start now.   As a former member of law enforcement, a Member of Congress, and American citizen, I am committed to protecting the privacy rights of the American people and abiding by and enforcing the law.

Knowing there was probably more to the story and wanting to see how he could help, Officer Milton had the young girl take him back to her family, where he saw they were struggling to get by.  It was only his first week on the job, but Officer Milton bought the family a pizza dinner and organized an effort within the police department to help raise money for the family.

Jameela testified before the Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee during a hearing focused on helping the 5.5 million 16 to 24 year olds across the nation who are neither in school or working find success through work-based learning experiences.    For seven years Jameela worked minimum wage jobs and bounced from one community college to the next.  She thought college was her only path to success, but continued to struggle to make it work.  At the age of 24, Jameela, her mother, and her dog were homeless. At that point in her life she was just trying to survive. But today, Jameela is thriving thanks to a program called Year Up, which is an intensive one-year training program for low income young adults that develops their skills, connects them with corporate internships, and provides college credit eligible coursework. Thanks to her hard work and the training and support she received through Year Up, Jameela now works full time for Microsoft, earns four times what she was before, and is on a career path with growth opportunities.  Her powerful story of overcoming homelessness to become a successful young lady is an inspiration and reminder that we must support innovative, evidence-based, and results-oriented programs that successfully move our youth out of poverty.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repdavereichert/photos/a.485060322598.271884.91504302598/10154943041907599/?type=3",NA,42,14,3,2,1,1,0,0

The 2014-2015 slowdown cost farmers, manufacturers, and retailers across the western U.S. hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and decreased the region’s foreign market share. Since the disruption, I have been vocal about the need of the ILWU and PMA to come together for the sake of the many workers and families who depend on the swift movement of goods to and from the ports.   This week’s news will bring greater confidence to the countless farmers, workers, and businesses across our region who rely on our strong ports and who suffered millions in losses during the 2014-2015 disruption. I commend the ILWU and PMA for taking action to prevent the situation from repeating itself. Washington State is home to many of the world’s highest quality agricultural products and goods that consumers around the world demand. With this agreement comes certainty for our exporters and their customers.","link","http://reichert.house.gov/press-release/reichert-commends-west-coast-ports-contract-agreement","reichert.house.gov",29,15,2,0,0,0,0,0

Let me be clear, there is no defense for the KKK or white supremacists and the racist views they stand for and they must be condemned universally and decisively. The greatest weapon to organizations founded in hate and the desire to divide, is Americans’ pursuit of unity, acceptance, and love for one another. From our earliest days to this past weekend, these values have been challenged and tested, but they have remained constant as an American ideal. As we mourn the senseless loss of life in Charlottesville and consider how to move forward as a nation, we must confront racists with what they fear most by continuing to work toward this ideal. With tensions high in communities across the country, progress can only come with the recognition we are all on the same team, a willingness to walk in each other’s shoes, and a common goal of regaining trust and civility within our neighborhoods and throughout the country.

While NAFTA has benefited nearly every sector of our economy, the world has evolved tremendously since the agreement was signed in 1994.

First as a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserves for six years, then in the King County Sheriff’s Office for 33 years, and most recently as a seven term Member of Congress. I am humbled to have been trusted by the people of Washington’s 8th District to be their voice in Congress; it is an honor I have not taken lightly.  Each and every day, I have committed to serving the 8th District and our nation with the heart of a servant.  After spending time during the August work period with family and friends, reflecting on the past, discussing the future, and celebrating another birthday, I have decided this will be my last term and I will not run for reelection in November, 2018. It was not an easy decision but I believe it was the right one for my family and me.  I have spent my entire career and devoted my life to service. I see this not just as a job, but as a calling - a calling I will not walk away from.  Washington’s 8th Congressional District is home to the most talented people, a first-class business community, and a breathtaking natural landscape that is second to none.  In my congressional career, I have always strived to improve the daily lives of my constituents and preserve the majestic beauty of our region. Whether it was through my work to expand the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area, improve our foster care system and combat sex trafficking, or secure equipment and resources for our first responders, I have taken this honor and responsibility seriously.  Early on, the importance of trade to the region was clear. From serving on President Obama’s Export Council to battling to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank to leading the fight to pass the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement, I have always fought to give our exporters the chance to sell their goods and services around the world. Now, at this critical time, serving as the first Chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade from Washington State, I remain steadfast in my commitment to Washington’s workers, manufacturers and growers – the best in the world.  Representing over 700,000 constituents takes a team.  My team, many of which have been with me since the beginning, have served our community with the heart of a servant, putting constituents before themselves.  Day in and out they have helped constituents receive government funds owed to them, get answers when their questions were bogged down in government bureaucracy, and acquire necessary equipment and services for our veterans. I am immensely proud of the work my staff has done.  This decision has been difficult to say the least but the love for my family ultimately guided me.   I look forward to spending time with my wife, Julie, our three grown children and six grandchildren.  They have made great sacrifices and I owe them not only my gratitude but more time together.  As I finish my last term in the U.S. House of Representatives, I will continue to fight for hard working families, small business and all that makes our community great.   I am deeply humbled by the support the people have shown since being elected in 1996 to Sheriff.   Every election has been an amazing honor. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for this opportunity.  God has blessed my family, my team and me as we have served.  Thank you and God Bless America.","link","http://reichert.house.gov/press-release/reicherts-life-service-enters-new-phase","reichert.house.gov",321,159,88,57,5,3,44,1

After years of calling for increased support for PSN under the previous Administration, the DOJ has taken the right step to better protect the American people. From my time in law enforcement, I have seen PSN deliver on reducing violent crime, including gun crime and gang-related activity. It is a results-driven and community outreach-focused program that sends a clear message to potential criminals that if they do the crime, they will do the time.  I am also pleased to see the DOJ has taken hiring shortages seriously and strengthened support for the COPS Hiring Program. I have fought for this program since my first day in Congress. Over the years, our law enforcement officers have taken on more responsibilities, suffered increased public scrutiny, and have been forced to work with fewer resources, making fulfilling their mission of keeping our families safe increasingly difficult. Putting more highly-trained, compassionate, and community-sensitive cops on the street will free up resources for law enforcement departments to tackle violent crime in our communities through community policing and intervention efforts.","link","https://reichert.house.gov/press-release/doj-announces-plans-implement-reicherts-solution-gun-crime","reichert.house.gov",144,69,18,12,2,3,0,0

IBC tends to occur in younger women and has a survival rate of only 57 percent for those in Stage III. During Breast Cancer Awareness Month and throughout the year, it is important we raise awareness about the different types of breast cancer, how to detect symptoms, and what treatment is available.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repdavereichert/photos/a.485060322598.271884.91504302598/10155400585682599/?type=3",NA,17,17,1,0,0,0,0,1
