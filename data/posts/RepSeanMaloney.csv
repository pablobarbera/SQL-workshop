Two major stops were Bagram Airbase near Kabul and Camp Bastion (formerly Camp Leatherneck), the forward operating base in Helmand Province.  During this official, bipartisan trip, I got important insight into the conditions on the ground and got to thank our servicemembers for their dedication to our country in person.   We all owe our military a debt of gratitude for their honorable service and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn more about the state of play in the Middle East.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repseanmaloney/photos/a.574025452610281.133998.551199354892891/1784863781526436/?type=3",NA,233,21,6,11,0,3,0,1
