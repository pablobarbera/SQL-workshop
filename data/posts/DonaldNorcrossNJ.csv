Creating jobs and fighting for working families remains my top priority. I will continue to press the new administration to renegotiate bad trade deals. We need fair trade that creates jobs here at home – not just free trade that ships jobs overseas.  We must also come together to invest in Southern New Jersey's infrastructure. Strengthening our region’s ports, railways, roads and bridges, as well as our energy infrastructure, will create jobs and position our economy for the next century of progress. To fill those jobs, we must expand affordable educational opportunities for every South Jersey family, especially at the county colleges and apprenticeship programs  – where I began my own career as an electrician.  And providing top-quality services for our residents will always be job one. My office is ready to help the people of South Jersey with any problem they may face, from receiving veteran’s benefits to resolving Medicare and Social Security Administration issues.","link","https://norcross.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-norcross-starts-115th-congress","norcross.house.gov",126,13,5,1,0,0,0,0

I spent my life in the building trades, first as an electrician, then as a union leader. Many working men and women voted for President Trump because they believed him when he promised to rebuild our infrastructure, create jobs, and raise wages. But in his first speech to Congress, Trump only paid lip service to infrastructure investment without offering any details on creating new jobs.   Democrats have a plan to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure, updating our roads, bridges and energy grid to prepare our nation for a new century of growth. It would create 15 million good-paying jobs over the next 10 years. Now it’s time for President Trump to present a real jobs plan for our nation.

I had the honor of working with Jim for years both as a labor advocate and a fellow state legislator, and always knew him to be honest, hard working, thoughtful and sincere.   Jim will, of course, be remembered as a fierce and greatly successful advocate for Atlantic City and the entire Jersey Shore. His colleagues will also remember his dry wit, good nature and competitive spirit, especially when it came to his beloved local sports teams and the students he mentored. Most importantly, he was a devoted husband and father to his wife Kathy and son Richard.   Jim was a true gentleman, and he will be sorely missed.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DonaldNorcrossNJ/photos/a.10152050274684132.1073741960.146510229131/10155116954159132/?type=3",NA,63,18,9,8,0,2,63,0
