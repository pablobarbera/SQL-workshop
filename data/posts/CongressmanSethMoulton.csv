But what they came up with is essentially the Affordable Care Act without the affordable partâ€”not for working families and not for our nation since they have no idea how much this bill will add to our national debt.   Speaker Ryan's replacement bill is a tax hike for working families who will no longer be able to afford health care or have the economic security that comes with it. Health care is a universal right that we owe to every American. Yet Iâ€™ve heard many of my Republican colleagues say that Americans need to make choices to pay for health care; they donâ€™t get the economic challenges facing working families.

During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to create good-paying jobs, invest in our infrastructure, and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to thrive in the new economy. I have advocated for all those things myselfâ€”they are bipartisan priorities. Yet, President Trumpâ€™s budget makes no mention of jobs, infrastructure investment, or expanding economic opportunity for all Americans.  Trump's budget makes all the wrong trade-offs. Cutting investments in research and development that advance lifesaving medicines and spur untold economic innovation and job creation is beyond shortsighted. It is destructive to America. To pay for a wall that no one actually wants, Trump is gutting the Coast Guard and the airport security funding that protect our seas and skies. To build up a military to fight wars, Trump guts the State Departmentâ€™s capacity to avoid wars through diplomacy and directly puts our troops livesâ€™ at increased risk. To give massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, Trump cuts entrepreneurship, rural investment, and job-training programs that support middle-class workers and small business owners. Itâ€™s all the wrong trade-offs.  Instead, Iâ€™d invest in America: in our people, in our schools, and in our infrastructure, to reignite the American Dream and spur our future prosperity as a nation. Trump's budget will prevent Americans from attaining economic opportunity and security, and Americans deserve a plan that helps all of us succeed in the new economy and prepares our country to win the 21st century.","status",NA,NA,604,56,82,23,1,2,9,57

Finding bipartisanship on health care is not impossible. In Massachusetts, Republicans and Democrats worked together to create a plan that increased coverage and decreased health care costs, and when there were issues in the law, they fixed them and made the plan better.   Trumpcare is nothing but a tax cut for billionaires paid for not just in dollars and cents, but in the lives and health and welfare of working people. Because of Trumpcare, Americans will live sicker and die sooner.   There are many issues that come before us where I believe reasonable people can disagree.

Jennifer Harris, of Swampscott, was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a Sea Knight helicopter pilot. Her aircraft was shot down by insurgents in Iraq on February 7, 2007, as she was transporting blood supplies to troops in need.  I have never seen more people of Swampscott lining the roads than on the frigid day in the middle of a New England winter when we marched for her funeral. The town honored her beautifully on that day, but with a memorial in Washington, her friends and family will have a place to honor her sacrifice for the rest of their lives.  On Friday, President Trump signed the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act into law after it unanimously passed both the House and the Senate. This is a major milestone in a journey my office started more than a year ago as a bipartisan effort to create a memorial honoring those who have served on active duty in the longest war in American history.","link","http://www.salemnews.com/opinion/columns/column-honoring-those-who-made-the-ultimate-sacrifice/article_8c3953a2-3df1-50e1-92eb-242971a4c5af.html","salemnews.com",507,36,51,57,0,4,76,0

Now that the Administration has made this declaration, it's time for the president to actually act. Republicans cannot have the best of both worlds. We cannot keep having conversations about gutting the ACA while simultaneously talking about the opioid epidemic. And we cannot declare a public health emergency without actually allocating resources to help combat it. Only 1 in 10 people with an opioid addiction is receiving the treatment he or she needs, and this is largely because of a lack of insurance. Now more than ever, we must rise above politics - peoples lives are literally on the line. My district, like so many others, has been impacted by opioid addiction. This epidemic has touched all of us personally in some way and it's time to act. I will continue to focus my efforts on ensuring more Americans have health care coverage and access to treatment. I invite my colleagues to stop trying to drive premiums up and coverage down so we can actually focus on the task at hand - making our communities healthier and safer.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html","nytimes.com",220,55,26,13,0,0,11,6

Seth Moulton isnâ€™t afraid to call out military leaders for mismanaging defense strategy and budgets or kowtowing to the president, even if it means challenging decorated eminences inside the Beltway. â€¦ â€œIn 2017, Moulton emerged as a cool-headed foil to a capricious commander in chief â€” one possessing the military bona fides that Trump lacks. He recently opposed the troop increases in Afghanistan and favors restraint on North Korea and Iran. Trump is â€˜approaching these significant challenges dangerously and erratically,â€™ Moulton says. â€˜Itâ€™s why Democrats need to step up and provide more leadership on national defense.â€™ â€¦ â€œSupporters championing his â€˜country over partyâ€™ stance see him as a voice of reason and authority, standing out among his colleagues and two currently divided parties. Even some of the people he criticizes â€” the architects of the wars he helped fight â€” endorse him, in spite of his calls to fill a strategy vacuum with long-term plans for reconstruction rather than open-ended conflict. Moulton says the â€˜secretâ€™ to winning them over without pandering is simply â€˜speaking the truth.â€™ â€¦ â€œâ€™Seth Moulton truly exemplifies the contributions that veterans of Americaâ€™s post-9/11 wars have been making as they transition from the military to civilian lives,â€™ David Petraeus, former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, wrote in an email. â€˜His commitment to reach across the aisle and to resolve important legislative issues has been both courageous and heartening.â€™â€","link","https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2017/profile/seth-moulton?ce385a3ed8","gt.foreignpolicy.com",501,41,37,41,4,0,0,1
