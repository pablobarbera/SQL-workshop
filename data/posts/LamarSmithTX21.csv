Our plan would eliminate Obamacare’s unpopular taxes and mandates, expand choice, improve access, and lower costs.

It’s unfair to the vast majority of honest and hardworking employees at Texas VA facilities when the agency doesn’t hold bad actors accountable.

While I was there, Hunter Beaton explained his Day 1 Bag project to me. When Beaton was brainstorming on his Eagle Scout project over a year ago, his thoughts went back to how when his now-adopted siblings first entered his home, they had all of their belongings in black trash bags. Beaton decided he wanted to give children in the foster system a high quality bag to hold their belongings, and thus Day 1 Bags was created.   Hunter is making a big difference in the lives of kids and for his efforts has been named a Texas Board of Education Student Hero, recognized by the Texas VFW as Scout of the Year, and received several other awards.

While we will never be able to truly repay our veterans, we must work to ensure veterans receive proper care and support. Already this year, the House has passed over 25 bills aimed at helping our former service members, and their families. This includes the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Assistance Act, a landmark bill that expands opportunities for veterans by removing the 15-year time limit on the use of GI bill benefits. Additionally, I have supported multiple measures that will increase accountability at the VA, provide jobs for servicemen and servicewomen, and ensure that all veterans receive the benefits and care they deserve.  Assisting our veterans is a priority every day, not just today. The 21st Congressional District is home to over 60,000 veterans, current members of the military and their families.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act creates jobs, reduces taxes and gives bigger paychecks to families.  This bill raises incomes for families in Texas by an average of $2,558. This bill increases the child tax credit from $1000 to $1600 to provide more support for Texans taking care of their children. Over 45,000 taxpayers in the 21st district will benefit from the child credit increase.  The legislation also simplifies the tax code – nine out of ten Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form the size of a post card.
