Director Mueller is someone who is free of politics, most recently demonstrated in 2011 when the Senate voted 100-0 to extend his term as FBI Director for two years. He has a long and distinguished career in law enforcement and a tremendously in-depth understanding of the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

He was surrounded by loved ones over these last days--both human and furry.  I was privileged to share Phil's journey for the last 20 years as next door neighbors, and having lost my dad at 12, he was like a father to me. Phil was a rare treasure to those of us who were blessed to know and love him. He was selfless, literally until his last breath, always thinking of serving and protecting others.  He proudly served our country in the Navy for four years and continued to tell stories of his time in uniform many decades later with a smile and a glimmer in his eye. He worked hard his whole life with his hands, and loved to fix things and take care of things for others. Phil was a dog-lover, including his own furry angels like his beloved English setter Molly, many foster rescue golden retrievers, and my two goldens--Penelope and now Boomer. We have a hole in the wall between our houses so the dogs could roam freely in our little ""commune,"" sometimes scoring two dinners before we could coordinate on text.     Phil and his wife Helene were married for 41 years, a wonderful example of faithful devotion and partnership.  Helene has been an amazing wingwoman in this very difficult fight with cancer as a caregiver and partner while balancing work and other responsibilities she had to take on due to Phil's illness.  Phil's endearing, curmudgeonly personality would make for some lively discussions on a variety of topics, but his stubbornness helped him in the grueling struggle with cancer and treatment. In these last days, he was truly suffering in pain from this aggressive carcinoma, and his body started to shutdown. Today we were praying over him affirming he could let go and be with God fully restored and freed from all memories of the suffering. In the midst of our prayer, he squeezed his eyes closed two times, then took his last breath. We are relieved he isn't in pain anymore, but heart-broken missing him and his presence in our lives. Rest well, Phil, and know that you are deeply loved and missed. Thanks to so many who have been praying for Phil all along and in these last days. I am deeply grateful.  With all the negative focus on the VA, I also want to pass on my heartfelt gratitude to the amazing men and women who cared for Phil during this complex path of surgeries, treatment, recovery, setbacks, multiple scares, and  ultimately hospice.  I want to specifically thank Dr. Steve Thomson and Dr. Michael Bays, who exhibited extraordinary skill, commitment, expertise, counsel, and compassion on this roller coaster ride. ENT PA Guy Penn did an exceptional job helping to treat the many wounds Phil experienced along the way. And I am deeply thankful for all the nurses who cared for him 24/7 during multiple stays and especially in these last weeks.  Special thanks to Jackie Gudanowski, Tracy Johnston, Chris Gates, Armeda Valenzuela, and Sheree Booth. You are all truly angels in our midst with a special gift for caring and compassion.  You allowed Phil to fight with all possible weapons and bravely depart this world with dignity and peace.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcSally/photos/a.1670121166540792.1073741829.1605647229654853/1972645482955024/?type=3",NA,319,169,41,109,0,2,293,2

They founded our country on a radical concept of freedom – daring to say that all of us are created equal and that every person has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   Every day for the last 241 years, this country has faced threats from those who want to take away our right to be free. But time and time again, the brave people of this nation have refused to back down. Generations of Patriots have laid down their lives to defend our liberties. Every American owes a debt of gratitude to all those who have taken up the call to serve to keep us – and our freedoms – safe.     As we gather to celebrate, let us remember the many blessings that we have as Americans. I wish a happy and peaceful Independence Day to all of the residents of Southeastern Arizona.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcSally/photos/a.1605675939651982.1073741828.1605647229654853/1996433113909594/?type=3",NA,793,116,27,70,2,1,0,12

At the time, I was 10 months into a year-long deployment to Saudi Arabia. Like most Americans, I first learned of the attacks from watching the news, as real-time images of planes striking the twin towers streamed across TVs in the Air Operations Center. Initially, there was a lot of confusion and disbelief. Very quickly, though, it became clear — we were under attack.  For me and those around me in uniform, we were outraged that our cowardly enemies would choose to attack innocent civilians instead of bringing the fight to us, those who signed up to serve. But our feelings of anger swiftly gave way to a hardened resolve to bring to justice those responsible and win this war on terror, militarily and ideologically.  It wasn’t long before orders came in that we would be taking military action in Afghanistan, and our role was to plan, execute, and provide oversight of the air campaign. The next few months were some of the most stressful and sleepless days and nights of my life as we went after Al Qaeda and the Taliban government that gave them refuge.  Today, the name of our enemy has changed, but their hateful ideology has not. ISIS still promotes the same intolerant, violent, extremist ideology that Al Qaeda did previously.   In the face of these evolving and dangerous threats, we must remain vigilant. In my roles on two critical national security committees, the House Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, I am committed to ensuring our military is strong and that we have robust security systems in place.  Above all, we must remember it is the ideals at the core of our nation that will ultimately win out over radical Islamic extremism: freedom, opportunity, and equal treatment for all.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission.   Equal rights and freedom of speech/religion can and should co-exist in our country and all are protected by the Constitution.  However, in recent years, there has been an attempt to protect the former while infringing on the rights of the latter.   Unlike other businesses aiming to levy blanket discrimination, Jack Phillips serves everyone in his cake-shop regardless of who they are or who they love, including pre-made cakes for any event.  Phillips simply asked that he not be forced by the government to use his artistic talents to design custom cakes that express beliefs that violate his sincerely-held religious views. That's a crucial distinction. This is a very narrow request for freedom of speech and religious liberty.  Today’s case is not about discrimination—it’s about whether or not the government should be able to compel artists to create things that clash with their faith.  Although Phillips asked for a very narrow exception, Colorado ordered him to create the custom cake against his conscience. To honor his beliefs, he stopped designing all custom cakes and workers lost jobs since that was 40% of his small business.  Yet Colorado’s public accommodation law has not been neutrally applied in all circumstances, instead, it is forcing compliance for specific ideological issues.   The outcome of Phillip’s case before the Supreme Court will have wide-ranging impact. America needs to preserve our tradition that allows people of good faith to disagree and find ways for all of our constitutional rights to remain protected.","status",NA,NA,329,217,31,19,4,3,3,68

This bill also includes a provision that I dedicate to the memory of Loren Thorson, a veteran from Green Valley who was committed to protecting seniors from hidden tax hikes threatening their lifelong savings. It was Loren who alerted me to a little known but widely felt tax increase in Obamacare, and the need to extend the Medical Expense Deduction and shield seniors from even more taxes on their medical bills. In response, I introduced the Halt Tax Increases on Seniors and the Middle Class Act to extend the medical expense deduction and worked to include it in these tax cuts today. I wish Loren were still with us today to see how his tireless work will now impact the lives of every American family facing medical expenses.  It’s time we respect Arizonans time and return their money. When we last reformed the tax system—over 30 years ago—it unleashed an explosion of growth and jobs in America. Let’s do it again.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcSally/photos/a.1605675939651982.1073741828.1605647229654853/2073911399495098/?type=3",NA,474,288,47,57,16,1,9,127

Major Cory Cilia has been my Air Force fellow this past year, and he now moves on to his next assignment. Major Cilia's contributions to our office have been as impressive as he is. Major Cilia, fondly known as “Beaker,” brought his combat experience, affable nature, and strategic prowess to my defense team. As a former Air Force defense fellow myself under Senator Kyl, I know how the Congressional affairs world can be entirely foreign for someone coming straight from the military. Cory caught on quickly and made a lasting impact, not only here on Capitol Hill but also for all of our troops. His efforts in our office contributed to securing necessary provisions for our local and national military—and to the formation of the PRIVATE Act, my bill that President Trump signed into law last week that protects service members in response to the Marines United scandal. Beaker, you will be missed but I know you will go on to accomplish even bigger and great things in your next assignment!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcSally/photos/a.1605675939651982.1073741828.1605647229654853/2074378542781717/?type=3",NA,213,16,2,10,2,0,16,3
