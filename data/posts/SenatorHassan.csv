Read her full statement below:    ""Today, I stood up to protect health insurance coverage for tens of thousands of Granite Staters and millions of Americans, and to continue the fight against the opioid crisis.   ""Through our bipartisan, business-backed New Hampshire Health Protection Plan, and the reduced-cost coverage available through the marketplace, tens of thousands of New Hampshire citizens now have access to basic health care, including critical coverage for substance abuse treatment and behavioral health services. Eliminating this important bipartisan program would set back our efforts to combat the heroin, fentanyl and opioid crisis and greatly hinder our ability to provide treatment to Granite Staters in need.   ""We should work together across party lines to improve the Affordable Care Act, which has helped 690,000 Granite Staters -- with no out-of-pocket cost – access basic preventive services such as cancer screenings, contraception, and flu shots.   ""Repealing the Affordable Care Act without any replacement is a recipe for upheaval, instability and increased costs across the health insurance market, hurting our families, small businesses and economic progress. This resolution sets us on a perilous path, and I will continue to stand up for the people of New Hampshire and strongly fight any efforts to take away Granite Staters’ health insurance coverage.”","status",NA,NA,145,23,6,15,0,1,0,0

No student should be discriminated against due to their gender identity, yet evidence shows that transgender students are subjected to devastating levels of bullying and discrimination in schools. Our government should be focused on ensuring that all students are safe, not rolling back protections for some of our most vulnerable children.   “I’m proud that in New Hampshire we have taken steps to advance the rights of transgender Granite Staters. We are a stronger, more inclusive society when all citizens are fully included in civic and economic life, and I’m going to continue to push the administration to respect the rights and dignity of all LGBTQ Americans.”","status",NA,NA,511,63,51,57,1,0,21,0

Growing up, my mom was a leader by example. I watched as she and my dad worked to further the values of freedom, equality and inclusion every day, and to make sure that their children would do the same. One of my earliest political memories is collating materials at the dining room table that my mother was sending out as President of our local League of Women Voters. And in later years, she taught history at our local high school, teaching me about what it really means to mentor young people and to help them thrive.    I am forever grateful to my mother for teaching me that while inclusion is hard, it is necessary. So today, please join me in thanking Peggy – and so many women out there like her – for teaching us that when more people have a seat at the table, we all get stronger.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHassan/photos/a.553083364704474.131569.523773000968844/1505709259441875/?type=3",NA,169,9,2,26,0,0,0,0

Trumpcare would have meant that if you are an older American, you would face a new age tax. If you are struggling with addiction or behavioral health challenges, you would have lost a vital lifeline in seeking treatment. And if you are a woman, there would be no guaranteed coverage for essential health services like maternity and newborn care. While I am encouraged to see this measure fail in the U.S. House of Representatives, we must stay vigilant against attempts to pull our health care system backward. Instead of continuing to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, now is the time to come together to take common-sense steps to improve the ACA, particularly by focusing on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. I stand ready to work with anyone – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – to lower costs and move our health care system forward.","status",NA,NA,958,100,44,79,5,0,2,1

It is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration – starting with its Commissioner – to protect consumers and stand up for public health. I am troubled by Dr. Gottlieb’s close financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and his record on critical priorities such as addressing the substance misuse crisis and protecting women’s health. I am especially concerned about Dr. Gottlieb’s connections to a particular company that makes fentanyl products, and about his opposition to the creation of one of the FDA’s key tools to combat the substance misuse crisis, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), which the agency uses to try to stem the risks associated with certain medications.   Additionally, I am concerned about Dr. Gottlieb’s role in the Bush Administration’s controversial and unscientific delay in approving the emergency contraceptive Plan B for over-the-counter use.   I hope that Dr. Gottlieb has learned about these critical priorities throughout the nomination process, and that he proves to be a stronger Commissioner than his record suggests.

I am grateful that the Trump Administration has discussed the severity of this crisis, but their actions so far don’t match their words.   Trumpcare would hurt hard-working people across New Hampshire and America – particularly harming efforts to combat the substance misuse crisis. Trumpcare ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have said is the number one tool we have to fight the substance misuse crisis, and it also undermines the requirement that insurance companies must cover mental health and substance use disorder services. We need to be strengthening prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts, not pulling the rug out from under those in the throes of addiction.   Unfortunately, Trumpcare is not the only policy we’re seeing from the Trump Administration that would hurt our efforts to combat substance misuse. The Trump Administration has proposed effectively eliminating the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is responsible for coordinating the federal response to this crisis and administers critical grant funding. I have joined Senator Shaheen in introducing the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act, which reauthorizes and expands that Office and critical programs such as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program.

Children like my son are able to go to school and participate in their communities because of Medicaid, now under threat by TrumpCare. This bill actually makes things even worse than they were before the ACA, with drastic changes and cuts to traditional Medicaid. Without the support from Medicaid, school districts would be faced with cutting services like school nurses and behavioral health services. We cannot afford to go back to the days when we marginalize or don’t assist some of our most vulnerable students. I will stand strong with the people of New Hampshire, my colleagues, & educators in fighting against this dangerous Trumpcare bill.","link","http://bit.ly/2pUQShP","bit.ly",91,17,9,5,0,0,3,15

This cannot stand. The Affordable Care Act guarantees that insurance must cover a set of preventative services at no cost to you, including FDA-approved birth control. The Trump Administration’s actions today make it easier for employers to interfere with their employees’ health care decisions and would put women on the hook to pay more for the critical services they depend on.    Nine out of ten women of reproductive age will use contraception at some point in their lives. Since this benefit went into effect, women nationwide have saved over $1.4 billion on birth control, and this move by the Trump Administration would put a financial burden on hundreds of thousands of women. It is unacceptable that the Trump Administration has repeatedly worked to undermine women’s access to health care. Instead, we should be doing more to ensure that women have the coverage they need such as passing the Save Women’s Preventative Care Act I helped introduce.    In January, tens of millions of women marched to make their voices heard. They will not be silent in the face of these anti-women policies.    I will not be silent in the face of these anti-women policies.    It is unacceptable that the Trump Administration has repeatedly worked to undermine women’s access to critical health services, and I will continue fighting back against these attacks, including working to ensure that all women have the essential preventative health services they need at no out-of-pocket cost.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-could-narrow-affordable-care-acts-contraception-mandate/2017/10/05/16139400-a9f0-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.cde2fa40d552","washingtonpost.com",149,143,49,7,6,1,32,202

In New Hampshire, the suffering from this crisis is real and immediate. We need those resources now, not later. I hope that President Trump puts his words into action -- a good place to start would be backing our bill to get $45 billion in funding to those on the front lines of the crisis. He should also immediately direct Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prices for life-saving overdose reversal drugs. I stand ready and eager to work with anyone who is serious about combating the crisis - and it will take real resources to do that.","link","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/26/exclusive-trump-declare-public-health-emergency-opioid-crisis-partial-measure-figh/796797001/","usatoday.com",84,73,12,1,1,0,0,9

While we must mourn the heart-breaking loss of 26 lives, we must also finally take action to prevent these senseless acts of gun violence.   In the wake of Sutherland, we have learned that the shooter should have never been able to obtain a gun. Despite being convicted of domestic violence by the military, because of a loophole in the law his crime did not disqualify him from purchasing a firearm. We must close the loophole in the law that allowed him to obtain a firearm despite his crime.   Currently, as the law stands, domestic abusers are prevented from purchasing or possessing a firearm only after the court has issued a permanent restraining order. This leaves survivors unprotected right when they are most in danger: when the abuser knows their victim has left and only a temporary restraining order is in place.   Additionally, we need to expand the definition of an ‘intimate partner’ who cannot purchase or possess a firearm after a domestic violence conviction. As it currently stands, many survivors of dating violence who are never married, do not live with their abuser or share a child with them fall outside of protections. We also need to continue to incentivize states to strengthen protections for victims of domestic violence and abuse who are at risk of gun violence.   Today, I have signed on to three pieces of common-sense legislation that address these issues. I hope that we can work to turn them into law so that we may address senseless acts of gun violence and try and prevent tragedies like what occurred in Texas.","link","https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-hassan-cosponsors-bipartisan-bill-to-permanently-close-gun-loophole-exploited-by-texas-shooter","hassan.senate.gov",276,88,17,23,2,0,0,6

On Monday, I met passionate and engaged students, who asked insightful questions about being a Senator, at both Dr. Crisp Elementary in Nashua and Hudson Memorial School. I hope to see some of them run for office one day!  Ahead of Thanksgiving, I had the honor of speaking at New Horizon's Thanksgiving Breakfast to support the critical work New Horizons does to help some of New Hampshire's most vulnerable citizens. I was also glad to participate in the Nashua Food Bank's turkey distribution and to serve Thanksgiving dinner at Harbor Homes.   And it was wonderful to see the generosity of our state at this year's 32nd Annual Toys for Tots Campaign at the Mall of New Hampshire.

But here is what we know so far:   - The newest analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation shows that next year, nearly 13 million hard-working middle class families who earn under $200,000 a year would pay MORE in taxes under the GOP tax bill.   - By 2027, 84 percent of taxpayers would either see very little change or an INCREASE in their taxes under the GOP’s bill. 37 million households who earn under $200,000 would see their taxes go up by 2027.   This bill would also raise health care premiums by 10% yearly, lead to 13 million more uninsured Americans, and would add significantly to the national debt – which some will use as an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid going forward.

Part of ensuring that Granite Staters, and all Americans, can continue to create and compete is to protect net neutrality – a policy that allows for a level playing field online.    The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has recently proposed to roll back these important rules. Before doing so, the FCC asked for public comments on net neutrality. There are reports that this process was flawed, with hundreds of thousands of fraudulent comments in favor of his rollback that may have been posted by bots.    Today, I led 27 of my colleagues in calling on Chairman Pai and the FCC to delay their vote until they can obtain an accurate picture of the public record. Without additional information about the bots and anomalies surrounding the public record, the FCC cannot conduct a thorough and fair evaluation of the public’s views on the topic.

Let's be clear, our tax code needs reform but that reform MUST prioritize the middle class and small businesses like Water Street Bookstore and Enna Chocolate.   The bill my Republican colleagues are attempting to pass has it backward. Their bill, that they have crafted in a closed-door partisan process, puts corporate special interests and the ultra-wealthy first, increasing taxes on hundreds of thousands of New Hampshire families and adding more than a trillion dollars to our national debt.

This battle was one of the deadliest in our nation's history, a battle that my father was a part of.   My father left school after the bombing of Pearl Harbor to volunteer to fight in World War II. He learned many lessons in the Army, but one the most influential was during that battle.   The Battle of the Bulge marked one of the first times in World War II that white and black American soldiers fought alongside each other.   Thousands of miles away from the school where he had been studying, this young man from the Deep South found himself learning more about the values of equality and inclusion than he ever could’ve learned back home.   And after my father’s experience in this terrible battle where African American soldiers fought and died alongside their white counterparts, dad returned home to a life of working to make the notion that everybody counts a reality.  Today, I am thinking of my father, our service members, and our veterans. We remain profoundly thankful for their service and sacrifice.   Today I am also reminded of the lesson he learned: that everybody counts. And that everybody can make a difference.  I am inspired every day to continue to stand up for these values in the United States Senate; inspired by the resiliency and can-do spirit of the Granite State, and by the memory of people like my father.   I hope that you all find inspiration today and every day to be a part of our work as a state and as a country to ensure that every single American counts. And that every single American has the power to make a difference.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHassan/photos/a.553083364704474.131569.523773000968844/1792475504098581/?type=3",NA,272,35,3,56,0,0,1,0
