And Latinas only make 55 cents on the dollar. That‚Äôs just plain wrong.  What would Dr. King say about Donald Trump‚Äôs nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States?

After careful review of Mr. Tillerson‚Äôs record and listening to his views during his confirmation hearing, I will not support his nomination.  During his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, after my repeated questioning, Mr. Tillerson refused to recuse himself from all matters related to ExxonMobil for the entirety of his term. Mr. Tillerson has vocally opposed sanctions against Russia, which hamper ExxonMobil‚Äôs ability to drill there. As CEO of ExxonMobil, the company massively expanded its involvement in Russia, going from virtually no holdings in that country to holding the drilling rights to 63 million acres, an area the size of Wyoming. Only by recusing himself from all matters affecting ExxonMobil‚Äôs financial interests for the duration of his tenure would Mr. Tillerson be able to assure the American people that as Secretary of State he would put their interests -- not ExxonMobil‚Äôs -- first.  I also have serious concerns about Mr. Tillerson‚Äôs commitment to continuing American leadership on climate change solutions around the world. Mr. Tillerson provide insufficient reassurance that the United States would meet its commitment to the Paris climate accord.  He also refused to embrace the scientific view that climate change is now overwhelmingly driven by the burning of fossil fuels and failed to answer legitimate questions about Exxon‚Äôs support for climate denial groups during his tenure. America needs a Secretary of State who will lead the world to fully realize the clean energy future that will help us avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change while creating millions of American jobs.   Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Tillerson displayed a complete lack of understanding of oil‚Äôs role in geopolitics -- clearly a consequence of having worked solely at Exxon -- that disqualifies him from being Secretary of State. Oil and other energy sources are at the heart of major conflicts around the world, but Mr. Tillerson refused to support American energy independence or even to recognize the strategic vulnerability that comes with importing oil from overseas.   For four decades Mr. Tillerson has devoted himself to one interest and one interest only ‚Äì ExxonMobil. But Exxon‚Äôs interests are not America‚Äôs interests, and I have serious concerns about Mr. Tillerson‚Äôs clear conflicts of interest from which he refused to recuse himself.","link","http://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-statement-in-opposition-to-rex-tillersons-nomination","markey.senate.gov",6304,955,1369,633,9,57,11,16

The Keystone XL pipeline would ask America to bear all of the environmental risk without actually guaranteeing that the oil would stay here to bolster our energy security. The Keystone pipeline would be a straw running through America to transport the dirtiest oil in the world to the thirstiest foreign markets.

The Majority is trying to undo these rules by deploying a rarely-used procedural tool known as the Congressional Review Act.   In fact, Senate Republicans are talking about using the Congressional Review Act ‚Äì or CRA -- so often that it could actually get hard to keep track of which industry is benefiting each week.   So I brought down a helpful tool -- the Republican Wheel of Giveaways -- to the Senate floor so that the viewers at home can keep track of which industries are benefiting each week from Republicans using the CRA to roll back protections for public health, clean air and water.   Up first are the mining and coal industries -- They are the first big winners on the GOP Congressional Review Act ‚ÄúWheel of Giveaways‚Äù. First up for repeal by the Republican Congress are public health protections against the toxic practice of Mountaintop Removal coal mining.    Republicans like to say that there is a war on coal.

But that requirement is vigorously opposed by ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute and the oil and gas industry.   Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act was a bipartisan provision authored by Senators Cardin and Lugar. It requires oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments.   The Dodd-Frank disclosure rule goes to the core of the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs mission of investor protection. Secret payments can easily be expropriated by corrupt governments; they can also be a signal that a company is involved in risky business overseas -- risks that investors need to know about when making investments.    But by eliminating this disclosure requirement using the Congressional Review Act, we are potentially allowing for oil companies to make secret, undisclosed payments to foreign governments.

The EPA is our cop on the beat, protecting the American people and our environment from harmful pollution, hazardous waste and the impacts of climate change.  As Oklahoma Attorney General, Scott Pruitt has made a career working on behalf of the fossil fuel industry.   He sued the EPA 19 times to stop clean air and water protections. Eight of those cases are still ongoing and would impact how much smog, mercury, and carbon pollution is in our air and which waterways get clean water act protection. This is a clear conflict of interest to me.  At his confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt if he would recuse himself from all issues related to the pending cases that he has brought against the EPA. He said NO.   Unless Scott Pruitt recuses himself from these cases, he will be serving as plaintiff, defendant, judge and jury on some of the most important matters at the EPA.  Overwhelming, the American people want clean air and water and to protect the health of their kids. They want clean energy to power America.   These are the values that U.S. Senate Democrats are fighting for. But these are clearly not the values that Scott Pruitt shares. He should not be in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.","video","https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/videos/10154512345711379/",NA,288,38,211,3,9,3,12,42

Since the birth of our nation, our servicemembers have fought, suffered, and made the ultimate sacrifice so that we may live in freedom, prosperity, and peace. We have a solemn obligation both to honor the memories of those who have fallen and to reaffirm our commitment to those who return home.  That is why this week, I introduced a bill that would increase pensions for Medal of Honor recipients. The Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States. This small group of brave military servicemembers are our heroes' heroes. We must commit to honoring and providing for our nation's ‚Äéservicemembers who went above and beyond the call of duty with no thought to reward or personal safety.   I also am honored to join a bipartisan group of Senators to reintroduce legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the brave soldiers of Word War II called the Ghost Army. These troops were composed of 1,100 of America‚Äôs most brilliant artists, engineers and signal professionals who used inflatable tanks and other vehicles distract and trick the enemy, providing critical time and resources during key battles. But because the Ghost Army‚Äôs mission was kept top-secret, these soldiers have never received formal recognition. It is well past time that we honor these brave patriots who held the line at such a critical moment in World War II.  But we will not honor those who are no longer with us if we cut the programs that care for the servicemembers who came home. I pledge to work every day in Congress to fight against damaging budget cuts to health care, housing and education. These programs make sure that our veterans and their families are taken care of, and they deserve every protection and recognition which we are capable of bestowing upon them.  Today, and every day, we honor the men and women of our armed forces, who volunteer their lives to serve our country, who walk into peril to ensure our safety, and who go beyond the call of duty to secure our liberty and protect the great blessings of our nation. As Americans, we must remember our duty to pay homage to their sacrifice, and honor the memories of the fallen not only with our words, but through our actions.","link","https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-commemorates-memorial-day","markey.senate.gov",113,11,3,7,0,0,0,0

Senator Markey recently led a Congressional delegation to Japan, Korea and the China-North Korea border. He has called for increasing tougher new sanctions to bring the North Korean government to the negotiating table to freeze its nuclear and ballistic missile testing programs.   ‚ÄúThe Trump administration's lack of coherent strategy to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula means North Korea will continue to engage in provocative tests like today's until we apply the kind of crushing economic pressure that will force it back to the negotiating table. The recent actions by the United Nations are commendable but do not go far enough in depriving North Korea of the economic resources that allow it to continue its dangerous behavior. It is time to cut off all exports of oil to North Korea, end its use of slave labor as a way to generate cash for the Kim regime, and target anyone who enables North Korea‚Äôs continuing escalatory behavior. At the same time, we must also commit to utilizing every available diplomatic option, including direct negotiations with Pyongyang to deescalate tensions so that we can negotiate an end to the North Korea nuclear threat before it erupts into a catastrophic war that could take millions of lives.‚Äù","photo","https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/photos/a.500519636378.270731.6846731378/10155131241446379/?type=3",NA,126,84,19,4,2,0,10,7
