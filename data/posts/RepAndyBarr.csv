The American Health Care Act is an important first step in this process. While not perfect, it moves us significantly in the right direction, which is why the Wall Street Journal says the legislation would be ""most consequential GOP social-policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996.""  The bill ends the job-killing individual and employer mandates, cuts $1 trillion of Obamacare's worst taxes including the medical device tax, the health insurance tax and the Medicare payroll tax, blocks federal funds from Planned Parenthood, reduces regulations so that individuals can buy plans they want and can afford, and reforms Medicaid by returning power to the states. And unlike Obamacare, we are actually reading the bill and having an open debate. In fact, I am discussing amendment ideas with my colleagues which I think could address concerns about this first draft and would improve the legislation, which is the first step in a three step process to repeal and replace Obamacare.

This crime against humanity deserved more than mere condemnation; it demanded an immediate response from the civilized world to deter future attacks involving weapons of mass destruction.  Accordingly, I fully support the President's decision to strike the Syrian airbase from which the chemical attack was launched, and I agree wholeheartedly that the President's decisive action yesterday was in the vital national security interests of our country.  The days of 'leading from behind' and unenforced red lines are over.  Our allies can now rest assured that this Commander-in-Chief will give substance and meaning to our diplomacy through moral clarity and the credible threat of military force.  Our adversaries, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and radical Islamic terrorists like ISIS, now know that the United States will no longer hesitate to protect our national security and our values.

I was proud to vote in favor of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, legislation that will repeal most of Obamacare’s mandates, taxes, and regulations while making important reforms that will lower costs and expand access to care.  After seven years of broken promises, lost coverage, skyrocketing premiums, thousands of pages of regulations, tax penalties, collapsing co-ops, fewer jobs, and state exchanges which are now in a death spiral of fewer choices and rising costs – the House of Representatives has taken a critical step in the process that will finally repeal and replace Obamacare.  And we have done so in a way that provides multiple layers of protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  Since I first ran for Congress, I promised the people of the Sixth District that I would vote to repeal this broken law and replace it with reforms that will actually lower costs and expand access to care through patient-centered, market-based reforms.    The American Health Care Act accomplishes these goals and more.  It delivers the most important reforms to an entitlement program in American history, it cuts taxes by nearly $1 trillion, it protects life and redirects funds from Planned Parenthood to Community Health Centers, and it returns power from the federal government to the states and the people.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAndyBarr/photos/a.459934544054344.94215.457461137635018/1324041554310301/?type=3",NA,257,789,51,19,1,0,53,666

From the U.S. Army's D-Day history: ""On June 6, 1944, more than 160,000 Allied troops landed along a 50-mile stretch of heavily-fortified French coastline, to fight Nazi Germany on the beaches of Normandy, France. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower called the operation a crusade in which, “we will accept nothing less than full victory.” More than 5,000 Ships and 13,000 aircraft supported the D-Day invasion, and by day’s end, the Allies gained a foot-hold in Continental Europe. The cost in lives on D-Day was high. More than 9,000 Allied Soldiers were killed or wounded, but their sacrifice allowed more than 100,000 Soldiers to begin the slow, hard slog across Europe, to defeat Adolf Hitler’s crack troops.""","link","https://www.army.mil/d-day/","army.mil",101,10,22,9,0,0,0,0

A little after 7:00 a.m. Wednesday morning, my good friend, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, was shot and critically injured while practicing for a bipartisan charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia.  The bullet travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs and causing severe bleeding.    Several of my other friends and colleagues were also targeted, injured or narrowly escaped severe injury or death in this premeditated and politically-motivated assassination attempt.  A House legislative aide and a former House staff member were also shot and injured, one severely, along with two Capitol Hill Police officers, Special Agent David Bailey and Special Agent Crystal Griner, who were assigned to Whip Scalise’s security detail.    Shortly after the attack, Members of Congress were briefed by the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms and the Chief of the Capitol Hill Police.  Their report to us, corroborated by our colleagues who were eyewitnesses to the attack and lived through the harrowing events, was that if it was not for the heroism and quick reaction of Special Agents Bailey and Griner, who without regard to their own safety engaged the gunman in an extended firefight and ultimately eliminated the threat, dozens of innocent people would have been killed.  Their bravery not only saved lives, it reminds us of the risks taken and sacrifices made every single day by law enforcement officers who dedicate their lives to protecting our families and communities.   On Thursday, Members of Congress in both parties came together to support our colleagues and the victims.  The Congressional Baseball game went on as scheduled, carrying on an important annual tradition and raising over $1 million for charity.  Republicans and Democrats came together to pray for Congressman Scalise and his family, sing the national anthem, and watch Agent Bailey throw out the first pitch to a standing ovation.  By doing so, and by celebrating America’s pastime together, we not only showed the American people that we will not be deterred or intimidated by acts of violence, we also demonstrated that we are not as divided as the rhetoric or the news media often imply.  In fact, Republicans and Democrats work together on issues every day in Congress, and yes, we are even friends.   When I am in Washington, I attend a weekly bipartisan working group breakfast.  We exchange ideas, talk about what we’re working on, the challenges our constituents are facing and seek common ground and partnerships with Members of the other party.  It was altogether fitting that after learning of the horrific attack Wednesday morning, I joined my colleagues at the weekly breakfast, as scheduled.   And much of the work of Congress is actually bipartisan in nature.  Even on the issue of health care reform, which has divided the political parties in many ways over the last several years, Congress came together in a bipartisan way at the end of last year to enact the 21st Century Cures Act.  That effort, which will help patients suffering from diseases by expediting the discovery, development, and delivery of new treatments and cures, demonstrated that Congress can and often does find common ground on landmark legislation that will benefit millions of Americans, and that partisan divisions do not always prevent us from achieving big goals.  Recently, I re-introduced the bipartisan Horseracing Integrity Act with my friend, Congressman Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York.  While we come from different parties and different parts of the country, we both represent districts important to the horse industry.  So we introduced legislation together to resolve a problem facing the horse industries in Kentucky, New York and across the country.   I have joined with Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, to introduce legislation to fix a regulation which has undermined access to credit for manufactured homes.  I passed a bill with former Democrat Congressman Ruben Hinojosa of Texas to correct an overreach by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in rural lending.  I have introduced a medical malpractice reform bill with Congressman Henry Cuellar, Democrat from Texas, part of which may be included in legislation that will be considered by the House next week.  And every year I have served in Congress, I have worked with Congressman John Delaney, Democrat from Maryland, on a plan to use corporate tax reform and repatriation of overseas earnings to finance infrastructure.  Every single day in Congress, there are literally hundreds of examples like these of Members of Congress working across the aisle to address problems facing the American people.  Unfortunately, with the advent of the 24-hour news cycle, the media often ignores these stories to focus on division, conflict, and scandal.  Rather than report the news and the facts, they often give a megaphone to the loudest and most outrageous voices.  This is true on cable news and talk radio, but it is also true in our local press.  For example, several weeks ago when I gave a policy speech to a group of nearly 200 local business and community leaders, the Herald-Leader’s front page headline and lead photo the next day featured the approximately ten protesters standing outside of the event.   Similarly, I have hosted more than 70 public forums and town hall meetings since I was first elected to Congress.  Most of our local media chose to ignore these events until organized protestors began showing up to disrupt these events earlier this year.  While the tactics and views of these protestors do not represent the vast majority of Kentuckians, the Kentucky media has rewarded and encouraged their hyperbolic rhetoric and behavior with expansive coverage.   Maybe the media believes that this type of reporting leads to better ratings or higher subscription rates, but they should also consider that the public’s trust in the press has never been lower.  We would all be better served if the press focused on reporting real news, instead of resorting to a grotesque form of sensationalism and selective coverage that ultimately divides us and sows the seeds of hate.   To be clear, no one is responsible for the cowardly attack earlier this week other than the gunman himself.  But let’s face it: the modern news media has amplified the divisions within our country and unnecessarily inflamed an “us vs. them” mentality.  Every American has a constitutional right to free speech, to petition their government and to protest elected officials.  And freedom of the press is an essential part of our free republic.  But this past week reminds us that we all have a responsibility to elevate our political discourse, put our differences of opinion in context, debate issues on the merits, and at the end of the day come together as one nation and one people to resolve our differences at the ballot box, not through violence.   To all of the people of the Sixth District, I ask that you continue to pray for Congressman Scalise, his wife Jennifer and their two children, and for the full and speedy recovery of all of the victims of this week’s attack.  And as we all move toward healing from this tragedy, I will continue to be accessible to the people of the Sixth District and to work for your interests and values in Congress.","status",NA,NA,137,37,9,12,0,0,9,1

That bill, which was an appropriate emergency response to the disaster in Texas and Louisiana, passed nearly unanimously in the House and should have been quickly approved by the Senate and sent to the President without political games.  Unfortunately, that non-controversial legislation was modified to include non-emergency spending, raise the debt limit, and reauthorize the bankrupt national flood insurance program without reforms. I voted no.   It is unfair to young and future generations of Americans to raise the debt ceiling without enacting any reforms that would address the nation's spending addiction.  The national debt has doubled over the past decade and I did not run for Congress to treat the debt limit as a mere speed bump along the road to national bankruptcy.  It is particularly disturbing that this deal was sold as hurricane disaster relief but does absolutely nothing to reform our bankrupt National Flood Insurance Program which, before these hurricanes, was $25 billion in debt, is actuarially unsound, will soon require another taxpayer bailout and incentivizes people to build and live in harm’s way.  I strongly support providing targeted, paid-for and fiscally responsible disaster relief, and I voted to do so earlier this week.  I also recognize the need to raise debt limit and honor the obligations of the United States.  But simply blowing through the debt ceiling and kicking the can down the road with literally no offsets or fiscal reforms is exactly why our nation is rapidly approaching a debt crisis.","status",NA,NA,127,51,10,9,0,1,1,20

The deal provided the mullahs in Tehran with tens of billions of dollars in up-front sanctions relief in exchange for Iran’s promise to temporarily pause its enrichment program.  Unfortunately, the agreement contained fatally deficient verification protocols, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) now concedes it has no capacity to verify that Tehran is not engaged in ‘activities which could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device.’  That’s because under the terms of the agreement, international inspectors are barred from accessing Iran’s military sites, where illicit nuclear activities are most likely to be taking place.  But the most serious concern is not that Iran will cheat; it is that even if Iran is fully complying with the agreement, Iran will be guaranteed an arsenal of nuclear weapons in as little as eight years. And as predicted, the agreement has only emboldened Iran’s efforts to destabilize the region, support its terrorist proxies, and accelerate its ballistic missile program.  Today, I was pleased to hear President Trump announce a new strategy, including actions that will challenge Iran’s hostile ambitions and advance American national security and interests in the region.  As the Chairman of the Subcommittee that oversees enforcement of financial sanctions, I have been working on additional measures that can be taken including sanctions, to hold Iran accountable for its malign activities.”  On April 4, 2017, I held a hearing on the effectiveness of non-nuclear sanctions against Iran, where we determined that Iran Air, a state-owned commercial airline, has used its aircraft to transport fighters and weapons throughout the Middle East on the behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  As a result of these findings, I wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin urging him to ban the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran Air.  Similarly, I supported two appropriations amendments that would prevent the sale of aircraft to Iran and prohibit U.S. firms from financing such a sale.  Finally, I recently drafted a letter to the Treasury Department urging it to identify all entities it believes to have transacted business with the IRGC, a precursor to possible additional secondary sanctions.  With the President’s announcement today, I am hopeful the Administration considers these and other important recommendations.","status",NA,NA,82,56,8,7,3,0,3,23

Iran Air’s use of commercial planes to transport rockets, missiles, and other military cargo on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran’s Defense Ministry led to the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioning the carrier in 2011. At that time, Treasury found that Iran Air had also transported missile or rocket components to Syria, another state sponsor of terrorism and the site of a civil war that has claimed an estimated 400,000 lives.  Yet under the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama Administration lifted sanctions on Iran Air and agreed to license exports of commercial passenger planes to Iran.  I co-sponsored legislation to give Congress greater oversight over business the Treasury Department authorizes with Iran.  H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act was passed by the House today and now heads to the Senate for consideration.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepAndyBarr/videos/1523884697659318/",NA,74,39,3,2,1,4,0,7

But as usual the pessimists left one thing out of their calculations: the American people. They haven't made this the freest country and the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges. They never gave up. And after almost 3 years of commitment and hard work, one headline in the Washington Post told the whole story: 'The Impossible Became the Inevitable,' and the dream of America's fair-share tax plan became a reality.""","link","https://reaganlibrary.archives.gov/archives/speeches/1986/102286a.htm","reaganlibrary.archives.gov",71,115,5,6,2,0,4,55

Beginning in 2018, workers will be able to keep more of their paycheck, business investment and job creation will boom, and salaries will rise.  Importantly, we were able to secure important wins in the final version of the bill based on feedback from Kentuckians to protect Berea College, spur investment in the horse industry, make our signature bourbon industry more competitive, encourage more international investment in the Commonwealth, and help Kentuckians pay off their student loans and medical expenses.  After nearly a decade of sluggish economic growth, lost opportunities, and low confidence, America is making a comeback. This historic legislation will make American businesses more globally competitive and help put our nation back on the right track.","status",NA,NA,162,180,18,17,4,0,4,120
