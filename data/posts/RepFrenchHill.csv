They hand it to you right before you walk up to the podium. You take what you get,"" said U.S. Rep. French Hill.  The Little Rock Republican waited about 15 minutes so that he could read a 25-second-long selection, showing up in time to hear his Arkansas colleague read.  Westerman was given a single sentence from Article I, Section 5: ""Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.""  Once Westerman's 10-second-long snippet had been completed, he stepped aside so a colleague could continue.  Twelve minutes later, Hill read Article I, Section 5: ""No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.""  Start to finish, it took him 25 seconds to read.  Hill had a backup copy of the passage; he'd taken his own copy of the Constitution, a gift he was given by a fellow Arkansan a couple of years ago. ""I carry it in my pocket every day,"" he said.  The reading is a way for Congress ""to communicate to the American people that we honor the Constitution, we take an oath to abide by the Constitution, and for me it's an opportunity to send a message to our young people that they ought to read and understand our Constitution,"" he said.","link","http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jan/06/arkansans-join-traditional-reading-of-c-1/","arkansasonline.com",45,0,4,1,0,0,0,0

The short pause in refugee arrivals will help the new administration design an effective process for vetting. I was pleased the executive order maintained a welcoming number of proposed refugee acceptances per year.  As to the temporary ban on immigrants from the countries identified by the Obama Administration as requiring more scrutiny, while I believe the time frame of 90 days is reasonable, the design and implementation appear unreasonable and have unintended consequences for law-abiding citizens of both the United States and other nations. While modest inconveniences are acceptable in order to keep our homeland safe, blocking U.S. green card holders, students and professors possessing proper visas, and those extraordinary men and women who have aided us in our Global War on Terror is not acceptable.  The announcement by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last night that the administration will allow waivers to let green card holders avoid the travel ban makes clear that the president is willing to work with Congress and his cabinet to ensure no one is unduly harmed by his travel ban.

One of her mentees was a child who was struggling academically, socially, and emotionally. Karissa challenged her mentee to set goals so that she could improve in all three of those key areas. As the child began to progress in all three areas, Karissa realized that the reason her mentee had struggled so much before was because she didn't have someone in her life who could play the critical role of offering much-needed encouragement.  Through Karissa's guidance, the mentee is now a senior in high school, a successful student, and a member of the JROTC program with aspirations of joining the military.

One woman I would like to highlight today is Naheed Esar, a native of Jalalabad, Afghanistan. I met Naheed in 2015 when I was in Afghanistan as part of a Congressional Delegation visit.  At four months old, she and her family were forced to flee to Pakistan, where they lived in a refugee camp. In 1999, she moved back to her native country and studied in an underground school in Herat Province. In meeting with her, I quickly realized I was in the presence of a remarkable individual, one whose story should remind all of us that there can be a future with a free Afghanistan.  During our time together, I learned that she comes from a long line of extraordinary women. Her inspiration for her own success was her grandmother, a freedom fighter and founder of three schools. The indomitable spirit of her and her family has resulted in Naheed's successful graduation from the University of Arkansas as a Fulbright Scholar with a master's degree in cultural anthropology.

The bipartisan bill that was introduced by U.S. Senator Dean Heller,  Senator Gary Peters Congressman Bill Foster and me passed the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 56-2.  It is a very bipartisan and simple bill that would provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover exchange traded funds (ETFs). Over the past three decades, ETFs have grown from about 100 funds with $100 billion in assets to over 1,800 funds with $2.7 trillion in assets. However, despite their growth in popularity, due to the anomalies in securities laws, most broker-dealers do not publish research on ETFs.   Warren Buffett last week, in his letter to shareholders, encouraged the use of ETFs for long-term investment goals. However, as SEC Commissioner Kara Stein plainly stated last month, the complexity of ETFs make them hard for consumers to understand.  ‚ÄúLike mutual funds, ETFs allow investors to pool money into fund vehicles that make investments in a variety of assets.  Unlike mutual funds, which typically are priced once per day after the exchange closes, ETF shares trade and price throughout the day,‚Äù said Stein.  ‚ÄúETFs have undoubtedly provided investors, many of whom are mom-and-pop investors, with both benefits and alternatives. However, the complexity of some ETFs makes understanding such products difficult for the average investor.‚Äù   Our bill would help the ‚Äúaverage investor‚Äù make better sense of ETFs by allowing broker-dealers more flexibility in publishing research on them, something that is currently discouraged due to anomalies in securities laws and regulations.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrenchHill/videos/1234636213298340/",NA,5,5,1,0,0,0,0,0

We were able to have over 2,000 people on the call and we discussed a wide range of issues including health care, national security, the president‚Äôs budget proposal, and veterans issues. I really enjoy the telephone town halls, especially during these periods where I am required to be away from home because of the voting schedule in Washington.  Each of these calls yields a great sampling of constituents from all over the district, and all over the ideological spectrum.   Over the course of last night‚Äôs call, we had two different poll questions that allow listeners to answer a yes or no question about policy or current events. The results of the polls more often than not accurately reflect the sentiment on any given issue in our district.  Last night‚Äôs poll questions were; whether or not listeners supported the president‚Äôs spending priorities outlined in his budget proposal; and whether or not callers supported activity in the Senate to obstruct the vote for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. On the question of the budget, 49 percent supported the priorities of lowering domestic spending outlined in the president‚Äôs budget, while 38 percent didn‚Äôt approve, the remaining 12 percent had no opinion. That is about what one might expect based on the ideological makeup of our district.   However, more surprising poll results came from the second question about Supreme Court Nominee Neil Gorsuch. 66 percent of listeners disapproved of how the minority party in the Senate is obstructing the vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch, while only 22 percent approved. This morning, even Huffington Post carried a story linked to a more scientific poll that says only 23 percent of American support blocking a vote for Judge Gorsuch. Clearly Americans of all philosophical and political beliefs believe blocking the nomination of Neil Gorsuch is not in the best interest of the country, but yet Senate Democrats appear poised to do it anyway.","link","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-little-opposition-confirming-neil-gorsuch_us_58dacf6fe4b0cb23e65c2f2e","huffingtonpost.com",12,16,0,0,0,0,0,0

A natural fit to be featured, Senator Caraway was the first woman ever elected to a full term in the United States Senate. It should be a point of great pride for our state to have this distinction. After electing Blanche Lincoln to the Senate in 1998, our state became one of the few states to have had elected multiple female Senators in its history.   Senator Lincoln, another great Arkansan, would eventually go on to become the Chair of the powerful Senate Agriculture Committee, a position that carries a great deal of importance to the Nation‚Äôs top rice producing state. Her accomplishments in the Senate were invaluable to the people of Arkansas.

While I believe these projects to be of the utmost importance for encouraging economic growth, I expressed my frustration that much of the regulatory regime currently overseeing infrastructure spending creates significant delays and cost overruns at the expense of the taxpayer.   During our visit, I made it known to her that I have serious reservations about some of the ideas that have surfaced on how to pay for these projects. I cautioned the secretary against what I believe to be very bad policy, and that is the idea of creating an infrastructure bank or any ‚Äòwholly owned Government corporation‚Äô to backstop or direct selection of infrastructure projects. This type of policy doesn‚Äôt work and ultimately would unfairly pick winners and losers in determining projects.   In my view, a much more sensible approach would be to create a window whereby any American corporation seeking to repatriate money back to the United States may receive favorable tax consideration if they buy an eligible issue of locally underwritten and issued public securities that would then fund our many diverse infrastructure needs across the Nation.","link","https://hill.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hill-statement-infrastructure-meeting-secretary-chao","hill.house.gov",9,6,2,0,0,0,0,0

One of the young U.S. Army officers who entered the camp that afternoon was a 22-year-old captain by the name of Bill McKenzie (pictured below). Captain McKenzie said of the day, ‚ÄúI will not describe the horrible sight of our entry into Buchenwald, but I will tell you this‚Äîthat the crematorium was still burning, dead were stacked like cord wood on large trailers and the living dead were starving.‚Äù His words truly depicted the horrible atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.  Some 65 years later, I would give the eulogy at my father-in-law Captain McKenzie‚Äôs funeral. As part of the eulogy, I read a letter sent to our family following his death from Michael Levin ‚Äì the nephew of Jacques Graubart, a survivor of Buchenwald ‚Äì who wanted to send his condolences. In the letter, Levin wrote:  It was my privilege to attend the dinner in Brussels in 1995 that marked the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald concentration camp. What made the evening unforgettable was the presence of Bill McKenzie, who liberated the camp, among whose inmates was my great-uncle Jacques.  Jacques‚Äô love and admiration for Bill was abundant, and his gratitude for Bill‚Äôs courage was undiminished by the fifty years that had passed since that unforgettable event. For those of us who had the privilege to be present, the love and the bond between liberator and former prisoner was the purest display of love of one‚Äôs fellow man that we had ever seen.  All of the speakers referred to Bill as a hero. I was seated very close to Bill, and I glanced at him when such references were made. He immediately shook his head rapidly and firmly, denying with absolute conviction that anything he did represented heroism. Bill made clear to all of us that night that he was simply doing his job as an American soldier. Simply doing his job.  Though he would never admit it, Bill McKenzie will always be a hero, and his role in the War and in liberating innocent people from the wrath of Nazi Germany is a proud distinction for our family. His service, and the service of all the other heroes of the greatest generation, will always remain a source of pride for our Nation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrenchHill/photos/a.730497693712197.1073741828.727280547367245/1267378933357401/?type=3",NA,41,8,0,0,0,1,1,0

Res. 187, relating to efforts to respond to the famine in South Sudan. Earlier this month, I went on the House Floor to talk about this issue.   More than 20 million people in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria face starvation and famine according to the UN Secretary General.  At a time when the main stream media and Washington press corps is obsessed with President Trump, they remain silent when there is a mounting disaster that could make the Syrian refugee crisis look like child‚Äôs play.  All four of these countries have weak or failing governments and each is in the midst of seemingly endless conflict perpetrated by evil terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab, and Al Qaeda.  Pouring the billions of needed dollars into the region will help stop the coming famine, but it will take American leadership working with partners in the region willing to take a stand to rid their continent of these terrorist threats.  I will continue to bring to light the imminent crisis in Africa, and I urge my colleagues to focus on this critical issue.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrenchHill/videos/1284066218355339/",NA,33,20,5,1,1,0,2,0

I want to thank the more than 5,100 respondents for participating in this survey. While the survey data was collected from a random sample of emails in the Second Congressional District, it is not a scientific poll, and it is important to note this. However, the data do allow me to understand broader feelings of my constituents on this critical issue. After reviewing your responses, the biggest takeaway for me is that the vast majority of Arkansans believe it‚Äôs time to change the tax code.  Ninety-one percent of respondents supported a simplified process for individuals and families filing their taxes. Think about that ‚Äì getting 91 percent support on any issue is nearly impossible, but Arkansans clearly believe that the current process is too complex and needs changing. This almost universal support is unsurprising when you consider a 2015 report from the National Taxpayers Union, which found that 94 percent of returns are filed with some kind of assistance, whether paid preparers or automatic software, and compliance costs are estimated at almost $234 billion.   Sixty-six percent of respondents agree that there should be no Border Adjustment Tax (BAT), which is an added tax imposed on imported goods.  The same number supports a repeal of the estate tax, and 55 percent support the goal of reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. These are three key issues that will have a lasting effect on economic growth, particularly the corporate tax rate.  In the United States, we have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world. This hurts our ability to recruit new jobs to America, and it hurts our ability to keep existing American companies ""American."" Lowering this rate is essential to growing the number of well-paying jobs for our citizens, and it will benefit small and medium sized businesses who feel they are being taxed and regulated into extinction.    According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses make up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and 64 percent of net private sector jobs. A lower tax rate for them creates an environment where our strongest incubator of new jobs--small businesses--can thrive.  Another important data point was that 70 percent of the respondents said they are not willing to pay higher taxes to reduce the federal budget deficit. To me, this is consistent with what I hear when talking to Arkansans: the government's spending habits need to be reevaluated; our budget process is not fair to the taxpayer (particularly those who are working long hours to make ends meet); and individuals are saddled with constant tax increases, but receive little added benefit as a result. Nearly 59 percent said they want fewer government services in order to reduce taxes, 20.2 percent want government services and taxes as they are now, and 21.5 percent would rather have more government services if that meant more taxes. These data points are also important to consider when we are determining our budget.   As I have long said, I believe tax reform is a crucial step toward re-accelerating our economy, bringing more jobs to our state, and removing the burdensome process for individuals and families who file their taxes. As we move forward in this process, I will continue to seek your input, and if you have any additional thoughts on tax reform, please reach out to me on Facebook or via email (French.Hill@mail.house.gov).","link","https://hillforms.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=LD5GISGQB7FD6","hillforms.house.gov",20,31,6,1,0,0,2,2

In Arkansas, we have over 5,000 children currently in the state‚Äôs foster care system.  I am proud to work with my colleagues in the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth to shed light on the perpetuation of poverty and dysfunction our current system enables, and I stand proudly in support of H. Res. 314, recognizing May as National Foster Care Month.   For the past two years, I have had the opportunity to have a former foster youth personally shadow me for a day. This year, I was honored to host Starr Wilson, a former foster youth from my district.   After spending over 10 years in the foster care system, Starr Wilson ‚Äì full of drive and passion ‚Äì graduated with honors from high school and attended the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff on a band scholarship.   Unlike Starr‚Äôs story, when many youth across America ‚Äúage-out‚Äù of the system, they find themselves with no place to call home and lack the encouragement and structure to pursue America‚Äôs boundless opportunities.   I am proud to stand with the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth in praise of the Sixth Annual Foster Youth Shadow Day, which allows youth to intimately experience the fundamentals of the United States Congress and, in turn, aspire to be adept leaders for generations to come.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrenchHill/videos/1312127958882498/",NA,21,13,6,4,0,0,0,0

But there will inevitably be another mania and panic, and regulators always miss them. The definition of a financial mania is that everyone thinks the good times will last forever.  Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling‚Äôs Financial Choice Act addresses this tragic flaw by offering banks an option: Stay subject to Dodd-Frank‚Äôs costly regulations, or hold capital equal to 10% of assets in return for more lending freedom and less red tape.  Banks lend with taxpayer-insured deposits, and high levels of capital are a guardrail for taxpayers and shareholders. If the guardrails are high enough, banks can afford to take more risks without bank examiners second-guessing every loan. We‚Äôd prefer even higher capital levels, but Mr. Hensarling is raising the bar while moving banks away from their Dodd-Frank status as de facto public utilities.  Democrats call this a favor to Wall Street, but note that the biggest banks oppose the Hensarling bill. They‚Äôve prospered under Dodd-Frank because they can more easily absorb compliance costs than can smaller competitors. By one estimate the average capital ratio of the seven largest banks is around 7%, while most regional or community banks hold 10% or more in capital.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-choice-for-wall-street-1496964390","wsj.com",31,27,2,1,0,0,0,15

It is often said that if a community loses its post office or bank, it dwindles away.  In 1995 we had 243 banks chartered in Arkansas; just 10 years ago we had 143 banks chartered in the state. Today that number is less than 100. This significant decrease is partially due to the burdensome restrictions that have been placed on the banking industry. During the great recession ""bank"" became a four-letter word to describe the largest Wall Street investment bank to the smallest community bank in Arkansas. ""Banks"" were all seen as the cause for the financial issues of the day when, in fact, it was the community banks that kept this state and our country moving forward.  However, it has become much more difficult since the Dodd-Frank Act to meet the needs of Arkansans. This legislation is full of unintended consequences that even its initial supporters agree should be addressed. The Financial CHOICE Act, which was just passed in the U.S. House, has the common-sense regulations that Arkansas banks can use to help facilitate the dreams and aspirations of Arkansans. It includes easing of some of the onerous requirements for a mortgage loan that is kept in the bank's portfolio. It will allow regulators to tailor oversight to meet the risk profiles of each financial institution, so local community banks won't be painted with the same regulatory brush as the mega banks.  A healthy Arkansas depends on a healthy banking system.

Congress has been trying to address this problem for years, but the previous administration continued to protect poorly performing employees who were working against the best interests of veterans and taxpayers. While we experienced these problems in Little Rock through the patient data manipulation and the solar panel debacle, this represented a national trend, as many other areas of the country also underwent some form of mismanagement at their local VA facilities.    Our veterans deserve a VA that doesn‚Äôt tolerate data manipulation for personal gain and management that doesn‚Äôt waste the valuable tax dollars that were appropriated for helping veterans. Today‚Äôs vote, while not a silver bullet, is an important step in changing the culture at VA and ensuring that those serving our veterans are held accountable for their actions and operate in a way that always puts the veterans first.","link","https://hill.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/va-receives-golden-fleece-day-house-passes-major-va-reform","hill.house.gov",32,11,12,3,0,0,0,6

I believe it is critical that America continue to lead the world in matters of safe and effective energy production while protecting our environment. In fact, America has led the world in technological advances which have cut carbon emissions and air pollution, and the United States has already made substantial progress on addressing climate and pollution concerns, reducing carbon emissions by approximately 10 percent over the past decade. I believe, though, that the Paris Accord, while circumventing Congress and public debate on the issue of how to best address carbon emissions, would seriously impair the United States‚Äô ability to support critical jobs in our energy sector and maintain our competitive advantage in energy production, as well as limit our energy independence and hurt our economy. Regardless of the withdrawal from the Paris Accord, market forces and advances in our technology and innovation will also continue to reduce carbon emissions and recapture America‚Äôs competitive advantage in energy production. The U.S. continues to lead in renewable energy advances, doubling the amount of solar photovoltaic capacity in 2016.  This was due, in part, to the support of a multi-year extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) that was included in the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law on December 18, 2015. We also continue to make progress in wind and biofuel energy sources, and advances in technology have brought the cost of these renewable energies down significantly over the past 10 years. As we move forward on these important issues, it is my hope that the president will work with Congress, leaders of industry, and environmental experts to develop comprehensive environmental and energy policy that can accomplish our goals of protecting our environment, promoting American industry, and ensuring energy independence for the United States while exporting our technological advances and energy resources to our allies across the world.","link","https://hillforms.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=6","hillforms.house.gov",51,64,15,4,1,0,1,14
