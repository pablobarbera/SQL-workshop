These new guidelines tell us one thing: the Trump administration is willing to go after just about any member of the immigrant community. Last week, ICE arrested a DACA recipient and continues to hold him in custody without showing sufficient cause for his detention. Now the administration releases guidelines that lay the groundwork for mass deportation and tries to sell it to the American people as business-as-usual. This is far from the truth.  Under these new rules, ICE can go after people who have not been found guilty of committing a crime and remove them from the country within days of their arrest.  It also strips anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident of many due process protections.

Jeff Sessions lied to Congress and to the American people about his contacts with Russian officials in the midst of unprecedented meddling by Russian hackers in our elections. Sessions cannot be trusted to honorably carry out the duties of the office of the Attorney General—including his responsibility to thoroughly investigate potentially unlawful collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government—and should resign immediately.   This is the second time in less than two months that senior Trump officials have flat out lied about their connections to Russia. First, former National Security Advisory Michael Flynn lied about the nature of his private conversations with the Russian ambassador, and now we discover that the man responsible for investigating links between top Trump campaign leaders and Russia is also guilty of a similar lie.

Ruben Gallego","2017-03-06","2017-03-06 23:30:00","Donald Trump’s first round of executive orders gave us insight into how his administration would treat minorities and vulnerable communities. His first Muslim ban executive order went against the very core values upon which our country was founded and the federal courts struck it down almost immediately. Now, Trump’s updated Muslim ban is just a half-hearted do-over that reintroduces the same discriminatory rules masked in vague procedural jargon.  It is crucial to note that the revised order will still senselessly delay the admission of tens of thousands of Iraqi allies who are currently seeking safe haven here in America.  Contrary to the Trump administration’s misleading rhetoric, Iraqi nationals attempting to relocate to the United States through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program would still be impacted by the President’s ill-conceived policy.     By continuing to cast a wide net of bigotry across an entire region, Trump is only hurting the United States’ reputation abroad, endangering people who are fleeing terrorism and fueling the recruitment and propaganda machines of groups like ISIS. This new order is still unconstitutional, it is still un-American and I still oppose it. Today’s updated Muslim ban is Trump’s attempt to put new lipstick on an old pig.","status",NA,NA,100,30,10,1,0,0,12,20

Ruben Gallego","2017-03-07","2017-03-07 22:35:41","The GOP’s ""repeal and replace"" bill will gut Medicaid and weaken Medicare in order to fund tax breaks for millionaires. I will also not support a bill that leaves millions of families without Medicaid and millions of women without access to reproductive healthcare.  The Republican healthcare plan will cut taxes for the top 1% while blowing a $346 billion hole in federal budgets and the Medicare Trust Fund. Under this plan, millionaires will receive an average of $50,000 in tax cuts. This bill is little more than a tax giveaway to millionaires, billionaires and insurance companies.   What do average working class families get out of this deal?  They get left behind. The Republican health plan will leave state governments to cover the cost of Medicaid expansion, forcing them to kick millions of people off the program. The GOP’s plan will make health insurance for Americans in the ACA marketplace far more expensive. Last year, 124,346 Arizonans received federal subsidies to help them afford private insurance policies and this plan will make healthcare unattainable for many of those individuals.   Under this plan, millions of women all across the country will also lose access to cancer screenings, birth control, and STD testing and treatment. This is simply unacceptable.  Republicans had 8 years to work with Democrats to improve our healthcare system. Instead, they have decided to rush through a repeal of ACA without having a serious plan to consider. I oppose the GOP healthcare bill and will fight it on behalf of working families in Phoenix and communities everywhere.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/upshot/gop-health-bill-would-cut-funding-for-poor-and-taxes-on-rich.html","nytimes.com",104,24,45,9,0,0,4,49

He made it crystal clear that he has no intention of holding police accountable when he indicated the Justice Department would walk back its monitoring of local law enforcement agencies that have been charged with civil rights abuses.  Under Jeff Sessions’ watch, we can expect a return to unjust targeting of minority communities.   The American people deserve a Justice Department that will fight to protect the civil rights of all people and take strong action against those who threaten them.

I was proud to join a large and bipartisan group of my colleagues to vote in favor of a bill that will penalize individuals and businesses in all three countries in a punitive and corrective effort. In the event that the President vetoes it, I will also vote to override his veto for the good of the national interest.  The mere fact that the President opposed this legislation before he saw that it was supported by an overwhelming – and veto proof – majority in both houses of Congress shows us how out-of-step this Administration is with our national security interests. The President wanted a free hand to withdraw sanctions on Russian oligarchs and state-controlled enterprises. He’s more concerned about buddying up to Putin – a man that ordered interference in our election last year, supports a murderous and immoral despot in the form of Bashar al-Assad, directed the illegal invasions of both Georgia and Ukraine, and threatens the security of our NATO allies. Now, the President will not be able to kowtow to despots for unknown or questionable reasons.

Turns out there’s a bizarre connection between Trump’s border wall and his ban on transgender service in the military.     Speaker Ryan was apparently afraid that he wouldn’t be able to pass the defense spending bill, including $1.6 billion for Trump’s dumb wall, because Tea Party conservatives insisted on adding a provision blocking medical care for transgender service members. So he called the President asking for help. And what did Donald Trump do to get Speaker Ryan out of his latest jam? Trump decided to ban all brave transgender Americans from serving. He implemented one bigoted policy in order to achieve another.

It is time for this Administration to either stand up to Vladimir Putin or reveal why it’s so important to cave to all of his demands.

The sanctions issued by the U.N. Security Council on Saturday are a good first step and demonstrate that further action by Kim Jong-un’s regime will be met with a concerted response.  President Trump’s warning that North Korean threats will be answered by ‘fire and fury’ is as irresponsible as it is alarming. Instead of threats and over-the-top rhetoric, we must aggressively pursue a smart long-term, comprehensive strategy to address the growing threats posed by the regime. Among the steps that we should immediately consider are further economic sanctions aimed at those countries that continue to trade with North Korea. This critical moment demands sound judgment, not the usual bluster from the Trump Administration.  Relatedly, it’s outrageous that President Trump has barely lifted a finger to nominate an Ambassador to South Korea or fill positions in the State Department that are charged with diplomacy and the defense of our nation. Trump must show that he takes the mounting crisis in North Korea seriously, and move rapidly to fill these critical national security positions with qualified, cool-headed leaders who will treat this situation with the gravity it warrants.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/world/asia/north-korea-un-sanctions-nuclear-missile-united-nations.html","nytimes.com",144,38,37,3,1,4,3,20

Changes to the flight paths at Sky Harbor were made behind closed doors and without appropriate consultations with members of the affected communities or local elected officials.  And since that time, contrary to clear direction from Congress, the agency has repeatedly failed to take meaningful action to mitigate the harm done to our neighborhoods.    Today’s decision should serve as a much-needed wake up call at FAA headquarters. In complying with the court’s decision, it’s critical that the FAA move forward expeditiously and do so in an open, transparent manner with the public and the local community.","link","http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/08/29/appeals-court-strikes-down-controversial-sky-harbor-flight-paths/612134001/","azcentral.com",209,27,17,15,1,1,0,4

But more than his various cringe-worthy statements, it was his continuing failure to project the kind of calm, steady leadership that the international community has come to expect from American presidents that was most alarming.  As a veteran, Trump’s speech only served to heighten my grave concerns that he could steer the United States into war through bluster or sheer incompetence.  At the United Nations, the President implied that he would pull out of the Iran Deal, despite the fact that the agreement has unquestionably slowed or stopped Iranian progress toward a nuclear weapon. Scrapping the deal would isolate us from the world community, encourage Iran to seek a nuclear breakout, and prime the Middle East for a massive conflict. Without the deal, Trump is choosing a nuclear Iran, a war with Iran, or both.  The President also fundamentally misunderstands what a war with North Korea would entail. There is no ‘winning’ a war with Pyongyang. Destruction of the North is within our power, but doing so would mean the deaths of millions of South Koreans, Japanese, and yes, American troops and civilians in South Korea and perhaps farther away. It could – and likely would – mean war with China. That is no ‘victory.’  Simply put, every time President Trump opens his mouth, America’s leadership and global standing diminishes.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/09/19/in-u-n-speech-trump-warns-that-the-world-faces-great-peril-from-rogue-regimes-in-north-korea-iran/?tid=pm_politics_pop&utm_term=.0d6e0d1bb3be","washingtonpost.com",224,111,58,0,8,5,64,74

It’s no wonder that administration officials feel no sense of ethics and personal or fiscal responsibility when Donald Trump is at the helm. Donald Trump has made a career out of swindling hardworking people and trampling anyone in his path to get to the top. He has flaunted his lavish lifestyle and long ago abandoned any pretense of humility.  Donald Trump only cares about Donald Trump – it should be no surprise that other administration officials are following his example and putting themselves and their own interests above those of the government and the American people. Donald Trump has created an environment in which corruption and bad behavior are encouraged and rewarded.  I am fed up, and the American people are fed up. It’s time to bring back government for the people instead of government for the elite and powerful friends of Donald Trump.","status",NA,NA,571,71,83,50,1,3,17,21

But we can’t even figure out how much money he's going to make out of the deal because he refuses to release his tax returns.    And here's the thing: House Republicans don't care. They don't care about Trump using his office to enrich himself. And they've stopped pretending to care about the deficit. All that truly matters to them is cutting taxes for rich people like Donald Trump.

In the past, House Speaker Paul Ryan was a fierce critic of government confiscation of private property.  So he should oppose Donald Trump’s senseless land grab, right? Predictably, we haven’t heard a peep from Ryan about this issue.  That’s why Congressman Beto O'Rourke and I wrote to him today asking whether he supports allowing Trump to take property from American citizens at the border just to fulfill an idiotic campaign promise.

Moreover, the documents verify that the Administration is preparing for construction in environmentally sensitive areas, including the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge.

Every day, 122 Dreamers lose their DACA protection, are no longer able to work to support their families, and are placed at risk of deportation.   The clock is ticking and we must act to resolve the crisis that President Trump created by rescinding DACA. It is critical that Congress act now and include the DREAM Act in the must-pass spending bill this week.","link","https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-dreamers_us_5a2989ece4b0b185e53a3098","huffingtonpost.com",53,11,9,1,2,0,12,5

Ruben Gallego","2017-12-19","2017-12-19 21:25:02","Today, President Trump and Congressional Republicans pulled off one of the biggest heists in American history – stealing from the pockets of middle class families and workers in order to line the pockets of the already-rich.  Instead of leveling the playing field and investing in opportunities for all, the Trump GOP has clearly demonstrated that its primary goal is to reinforce the power and increase the wealth of the party's richest donors.  Ultimately, more than 80 million households will see their taxes go up under this outrageous plan. Make no mistake -- this bill represents an attack on the American middle class.  Just like the Trump presidency, the GOP Tax Scam is an abject failure that will come back to haunt the Republican Party.","status",NA,NA,121,76,35,1,4,1,44,126
