Under President Obama's misguided view, after having removed the Castro regime from the state sponsor of terror list and granting diplomatic recognition, the next logical step is denying oppressed Cubans the presumption of political asylum.    Since 1966, the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act has provided a lifeline to generations of Cubans fleeing oppression.  Many made the treacherous journey to begin their lives anew in freedom, and others perished trying to escape.  In addition, the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program provided a way for doctors forced to work under inhumane conditions for paltry salaries in foreign lands to escape their servitude.   President Obama's policy toward the Castro regime has not improved human rights or increased liberty on the island.  To the contrary, documented political arrests reached close to 10,000 in 2016 as renowned activists such as Berta Soler, Danilo Maldonado Machado ""El Sexto,"" and labor activists including Ivan Carrillo Hernandez suffered brutal arrests just in the past few weeks.  El Sexto remains in prison today and his American lawyer, Kim Motley, was harassed and interrogated while in Cuba simply for representing him.  Cubans are leaving the island in record numbers, and many of the 53 who were released as part of the Obama-Castro deal were subsequently rearrested.   President Obama's numerous concessions and extension of diplomatic recognition to the murderous Castro regime does not constitute an achievement.  To the contrary, his policy has been a succession of betrayals of America's longstanding commitment to human rights and freedom, and a betrayal of the Cuban people who have suffered under oppression for far too long.  This last act of diminishing lifelines to Cubans languishing in totalitarianism is one final despicable betrayal of a people who deserve better from an American president.","status",NA,NA,182,88,86,10,3,2,6,18

Despite international condemnation of his unjustifiable imprisonment, Leopoldo Lopez remains a political prisoner of the Maduro regime.  Lopez is one of many pro-democracy members of the opposition, including many elected officials, that have been imprisoned for running afoul of the corrupt Maduro regime.  As the human rights conditions continue to deteriorate, the integrity of government institutions are further corrupted, and the economy is failing, the Maduro regime lashes out against those who seek to address these mounting failures.  I commend the Trump administration for placing tough sanctions on Maduro‚Äôs right-hand thug Tareck El Aissami this week, and encourage further pressure on corrupt Venezuelan operatives and human rights abusers.    I was honored to meet with Lilian Tintori, Lopez‚Äôs wife, and Mitzy Ledezma, wife of political prisoner Antonio Ledezma, in Washington earlier this week as they travel the world to raise awareness of their husbands' unjust imprisonments.  We must continue to work toward restoration of democratic institutions and civil society in Venezuela, which begins with the immediate release of all political prisoners.  *Photo from my meeting earlier this week with Lilian and Mitzy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mdiazbalart/photos/a.128107280594326.25111.119538428117878/1346380368767005/?type=3",NA,30,9,0,4,0,0,7,0

The creation of this award by youth groups testifies to the vitality, determination, and ingenuity of Cuba‚Äôs pro-democracy movement. Oswaldo Paya left the Cuban people a remarkable legacy through his courageous daughter Rosa Maria Paya and the growing movement that continues in his name. The regime‚Äôs violent attempt to silence him and end his mission have only amplified his message and strengthened the determination of Cuba‚Äôs freedom advocates.    Reports indicate that the Castro regime will take drastic measures to prevent this pro-democracy event from taking place.  According to reports, former Chilean parliamentarian and former minister of foreign affairs Mariana Aylwin was prevented from entering Cuba to accept the award on behalf of her late father; former President of Mexico Felipe Calderon was also prevented from traveling to the island; and Cuban activists Julio Alvarez and Felix Fara were arrested.

With this bill, Congress fulfills an essential constitutional obligation ‚Äì to provide for a common defense. This bill does good things for the men and women who serve our nation in the military; it enhances our national security and starts rebuilding our military. This bill fully funds a 2.1% pay raise for the military, instead of the 1.6% requested by the prior Administration. We also target resources for the health care of our service members and their families. We provide important health programs and research into spinal cord, vision, and traumatic brain injuries so we can deliver the tools and best treatment for battlefield wounds.   Throughout the year we‚Äôve heard testimony from our service chiefs about the necessity to address our military's alarming readiness shortfalls. This bill addresses the readiness problems that are making it more and more difficult for our troops to accomplish their mission. We devote resources to prepare our troops for combat and peacetime missions, including flight time and training, to ensure we maintain our military superiority. Lastly, this bill provides the necessary and essential equipment, weapon systems, and platforms needed to maintain and sustain our military superiority in the air, sea, and ground.","video","https://www.facebook.com/mdiazbalart/videos/1370349746370067/",NA,35,5,0,0,0,0,0,0

The State of Florida‚Äôs initial request for a Fire Management Assistance Grant was denied at the regional level, however we are working to support an appeal and will assist Governor Scott and local officials in any way possible.  Please stay safe and follow the evacuation orders from Collier County Emergency Management, listed below.  MANDATORY EVACUATION UPDATE A mandatory evacuation notice has been announced as two wildfires continue to rage in eastern Collier County. The boundaries of the affected area are from the south side of Golden Gate Boulevard south to Interstate 75 and from Collier Boulevard east to Wilson Boulevard. A reception center opened at the Golden Gate Community Center, 4701 Golden Gate Parkway, Naples, Florida 34116, with services for the evacuees. This is not an overnight shelter at this time.

For almost four decades, Ileana has served our community with honor and integrity. From her days as an educator, to the Florida Legislature, and now ending her tenure in Congress, Ileana truly exemplifies what it means to be a public servant. She never seeks political expediency and always puts the interests of her constituents first. From one corner of the globe to another, she is tireless in her crusade for human rights and democracy.   To say Ileana is a trusted friend and mentor to me is an understatement; she is a part of my family, and I will dearly miss 'mi hermana legislativa' in the halls of Congress.

Already, in two of the three counties I represent, the Affordable Care Act only offers one provider, with no choice or competition for consumers. In 2016, Miami-Dade County had six providers and next year, will drop to three providers. Collier and Hendry Counties are worse off; they, like forty-five other Florida counties, are left with just one provider. Knowing the people I represent could very well lose their coverage, just like Iowa residents did yesterday when their state marketplace collapsed, is disturbing. It would be irresponsible for Congress not to act in order to prevent this from happening.  While this bill may be far from perfect, I am glad I was able to work with my colleagues to get significant improvements to the American Health Care Act, including:  -$8 billion dedicated to reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs for patients with pre-existing conditions, in addition to the $130 billion available to states to cut out-of-pocket costs like premiums and deductibles -Protecting Medicaid by reforming it to make sure it is on a sustainable path -An additional $15 billion for maternity coverage and newborn care, and mental health and substance abuse disorders  I will work with our colleagues in the Senate as they consider the legislation. I will also continue working with HHS Secretary Price and members of the administration to provide relief from the disastrous effects of Obamacare and ensure the AHCA truly serves the needs of my constituents and the American people.","status",NA,NA,92,353,19,3,5,0,2,116

The Supreme Tribunal Court‚Äôs decision to strip the elected National Assembly of its powers was an affront to the will of the Venezuelan people, who are entitled to representative government and an independent judiciary.  These sanctions, in addition to Ambassador Nikki Haley's words yesterday at the United Nations, are a strong condemnation of the devastation and tyranny wreaked by the Maduro regime.  While Maduro imprisons political opponents, censors media, corrupts institutions, and instigates violence against protesters, I commend President Trump for once again taking a strong stand on behalf of the Venezuelan people.  Hoy, el Presidente Trump impuso severas sanciones al Tribunal Supremo de Maduro en respuesta a la escalada de abusos y represi√≥n del r√©gimen as√≠ como a los grav√≠simos atropellos a las instituciones democr√°ticas de Venezuela, como la Asamblea Nacional.

Regrettably, a few decades later, that noble effort was marred by a brutal regime that has oppressed the Cuban people and insulted the memories of those who sacrificed for its freedom.  The devastation wreaked by the Castro regime can be found in its legacy of firing squads, gulags, torture, terrorism, subjugation, and widespread deprivation for the Cuban people.   Some look toward the stepping down of one dictator as an evidence of change.  But, as Jose Marti wisely said, ""To change masters is not to be free."" Without fair, multiparty elections, the rights to association, free expression, and religious belief, an independent media, and the liberation of all political prisoners, the Cuban people are not free.  We cannot tolerate the swapping of one dictator for another.   I am confident that the Cuban people once again will achieve their independence, as they did one hundred and fifteen years ago.  Until then, we stand with those heroes of today who, in the vein of Marti, persist in the struggle for freedom.  They are Berta Soler and the Ladies in White, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez, Yris Perez Aguilera, Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, Ivan Hernandez Carrillo, Rosa Maria Paya, Danilo Maldonado Machado ""El Sexto,"" Antonio Rodiles, Jose Daniel Ferrer, Eduardo Cardet, and so many others.  These heroes are recognized around the world for their strength and resilience. In the last month alone, I had the privilege of attending ceremonies honoring Dr. Biscet and the Ladies in White. They have endured countless sacrifices and assumed grave risks so that the Cuban people may be free.  Today, as we mark Cuba‚Äôs independence from a foreign foe, we also honor the spirit of independence that continues within the Cuban people today.  Together, we look forward to the day when the Cuban people celebrate their independence from the tyranny that has burdened them for nearly sixty years.","status",NA,NA,19,6,5,2,0,0,1,1

By making it easier for entrepreneurs to gain access to capital and removing bureaucratic red tape that hinders innovation, the Financial CHOICE Act encourages and incentivizes job growth.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mdiazbalart/photos/a.128107280594326.25111.119538428117878/1484099761661731/?type=3",NA,8,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

Last year, Miami-Dade County lost over $5 million in funding for essential homeless programs in the county. HUD‚Äôs homeless assistance program has become increasingly competitive as HUD directs more funding to grantees that allocate resources to projects known to deliver better outcomes like permanent housing and rapid re-housing. Diaz-Balart secured the $4.092 million in funding to help fill the gap for FY17, and these funds could be used for homelessness prevention activities, rapid re-housing, short- or medium-term rental assistance, housing relocation, and stabilization services.  ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce that Miami-Dade County will receive $4.1 million in homeless assistance funds. The Homeless Trust does excellent work for our community, and I truly enjoy working with them and local partners who are making a difference for the most vulnerable.  This funding will go a long way towards providing solutions and filling gaps can that effectively help address homelessness in South Florida. As Housing Appropriations Chairman, I will continue to work with my colleagues and the Homeless Trust to ensure the best use of federal funding.‚Äù  Of the more than 100 recipients, Miami-Dade received the most ESG funding of any jurisdiction.  Since 2015, Diaz-Balart has served as Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. As Chairman of this Subcommittee, Diaz-Balart has jurisdiction over and sets funding levels for various transportation and housing programs, including homeless assistance grants.            https://mariodiazbalart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/diaz-balart-delivers-over-4-million-in-homeless-assistance-funding-for","link","https://mariodiazbalart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/diaz-balart-delivers-over-4-million-in-homeless-assistance-funding-for","mariodiazbalart.house.gov",32,4,4,2,0,0,0,0

El pueblo de Venezuela ha sufrido demasiado tiempo bajo una represi√≥n brutal y una econom√≠a colapsada. El 16 de julio, millones de venezolanos rechazaron los planes de Maduro de robarse a√∫n m√°s poder con su ""asamblea constituyente"". Las sanciones de hoy tambi√©n son una advertencia; si Maduro sigue adelante con la ""asamblea constituyente"" prevista para el domingo, la administraci√≥n Trump est√° dispuesta a proceder con incluso m√°s sanciones, aparte de las anunciadas hoy.  Mientras Maduro sigue subvirtiendo las instituciones democr√°ticas de Venezuela, la administraci√≥n Trump y el pueblo estadounidense se unen al pueblo de Venezuela para oponerse a los descarados asaltos a la democracia de Maduro.  I commend President Trump on his decision to impose more sanctions against members of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.  The people of Venezuela have suffered under brutal repression and a collapsing economy for far too long.  On July 16, millions of Venezuelans rejected Maduro‚Äôs plans for another blatant power grab through his ""Constituent Assembly."" These sanctions also serve as a warning; should Maduro move forward with Sunday‚Äôs planned ""Constituent Assembly,"" the Trump Administration is ready to proceed with additional sanctions.  As Maduro continues to subvert Venezuela‚Äôs democratic institutions and undermine the rule of law, the Trump administration and the American people stand with the people of Venezuela in opposing Maduro‚Äôs shameless assaults on democracy.  http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article163676293.html","link","http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article163676293.html","miamiherald.com",77,5,23,9,0,0,0,0

Today's sanctioning of Nicolas Maduro is a bold and definitive message to him and other ruthless dictators around the globe that the United States will not coddle oppressive regimes.   For almost two decades, the Venezuelan people have suffered under increasing oppression. The four rounds of sanctions that the Trump Administration has issued over the last six months have expressed solidarity with freedom-seeking Venezuelans while opposing the thugs that repress them.  I commend President Trump and his administration for taking a tough stand against oppression.  As we continue to support the Venezuelan people in their democratic aspirations, I look forward to continuing to work with this Administration and my congressional colleagues to impose additional sanctions as needed and ensure that basic rights and liberties are restored.  --------------  La semana pasada, cuando sancion√≥ a trece miembros del r√©gimen de Maduro, el Presidente Trump advirti√≥ que si el r√©gimen segu√≠a adelante con su asamblea constituyente ilegal habr√≠a consecuencias graves.

Felicito al Presidente Trump y a su gobierno por tomar una posici√≥n firme contra la opresi√≥n.

I proudly stand with DREAMers and strongly disagree with the decision to end a program that has greatly benefited thousands of young people who are an integral part of our country. Congress must act on a legislative solution before DACA expires. We should not punish these young people for a decision that was never theirs to make. I have said time and time again that our country's immigration system is broken, and I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to obtain a legislative solution that will permit DREAMers to legally continue to contribute their talents and abilities to our great nation.  El programa de DACA es para ni√±os y j√≥venes que vinieron a los Estados Unidos por la decisi√≥n de un padre o guardi√°n. Me solidarizo con los DREAMers y estoy en contra de eliminar un programa que ha beneficiado enormemente a miles de j√≥venes que tanto han contribuido a  nuestro pa√≠s. El Congreso tiene que actuar con toda urgencia para aprobar una soluci√≥n legislativa antes de que DACA se venza.  No se deben castigar a estos j√≥venes por una decisi√≥n que no fue suya. Como he dicho una y otra vez, el sistema de inmigraci√≥n de EE.UU. no funciona y seguir√© trabajando para encontrar una soluci√≥n legislativa que permita a DREAMers legalmente seguir contribuyendo con sus talentos y habilidades a nuestra gran naci√≥n.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/daca-trump-congress/index.html","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/daca-trump-congress/index.html","cnn.com",69,46,21,6,2,0,2,4

There is also widespread street flooding. Power is out to more than 90 percent of the county and there is a boil water notice in effect. In addition, there is expected storm surge that could affect portions of western Collier County until the early morning hours.   A mandatory curfew is in place for all of Collier County between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.     ‚ÄúWe want you to be safe. We understand the desire is strong to go home, but please let first responders get out tonight, make sure our roads are safe and get as much debris cleared as we can,‚Äù said Dan Summers, director of the Collier County Bureau of Emergency Management.   The Collier County Information Hotline remains active 24-hours a day. Residents with questions may call the Hotline at (239) 252-8444 (within Collier County residents may dial 311).

U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are also eligible for these tax benefits.  This year, we have experienced an extremely active hurricane season that has left destruction and devastation in its path. After days without running water or electricity, parts of Florida are just beginning the rebuilding process. A large number of homes in our community have been deemed structurally unsafe, and hundreds more require critical repair. This legislation provides significant tax relief that will assist Floridians and others who have been impacted by recent storms. Many are now left to find the financial means to make needed repairs to their homes. Among others, by eliminating the tax penalty on early retirement plan withdrawals, we can help folks access the capital required to make these repairs and get back on their feet. These tax benefits also extend to citizens of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, assisting Caribbean citizens who need our support in this difficult time.  http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/352870-house-passes-faa-extension-with-hurricane-tax-relief","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/352870-house-passes-faa-extension-with-hurricane-tax-relief","thehill.com",35,4,14,1,0,0,0,0

Additionally, the impact of the storm has devastated our states farmers and growers, and it will be a long road to recovery for them. Specifically, the citrus industry, critical to Florida‚Äôs economy, was hit catastrophically and federal resources will be needed.

President Trump's announced policy demonstrates once again that the previous administration's failed policy of appeasement is over. Brutal dictatorships that oppose U.S. national security interests and suppress their own people will not be coddled. Those who assist them will be held accountable.  I appreciate the moral clarity that President Trump has demonstrated in emphasizing that the mullahs of Iran are not the Iranian people. To the contrary, they oppress and terrorize the Iranian people.  His policy is one that rightly isolates the mullahs and the Revolutionary Guard while maintaining solidarity with the Iranian people. With this principled policy, the United States prioritizes America's national security interests by preventing a terrorist state from creating nuclear weapons, expresses solidarity with the oppressed people of Iran, and seeks to further restrict the Iranian regime from obtaining resources to fund its extremist activities.  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/13/trump-decertifies-iran-nuclear-deal-slaps-sanctions-on-irgc-in-broadside-at-radical-regime.html","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/13/trump-decertifies-iran-nuclear-deal-slaps-sanctions-on-irgc-in-broadside-at-radical-regime.html","foxnews.com",53,27,1,0,0,0,3,14

I trust that President Trump will not allow Washington bureaucrats to stand in the way of his directive to support the Cuban people‚Äôs democratic aspirations.  ---------------------------------------  La intenci√≥n del Presidente en su anuncio del 16 de junio de 2017 sobre Cuba fue fortalecer las sanciones y prohibir las transacciones financieras con el r√©gimen cubano. Las regulaciones anunciadas hoy incluyen algunos pasos positivos. Estoy decepcionado, sin embargo, de que las regulaciones no implementan completamente las √≥rdenes del presidente. Est√° claro que personas dentro de la burocracia que apoyan la pol√≠tica de la administraci√≥n anterior hacia Cuba siguen socavando al presidente Trump.                                                                Seguir√© trabajando con el Presidente para asegurar que su pol√≠tica hacia Cuba se implemente por completo y que las regulaciones sean totalmente consistentes con sus intenciones, en contraste con las regulaciones anunciadas hoy. Espero que el presidente Trump no permita que bur√≥cratas de Washington impidan la implementaci√≥n de su pol√≠tica en apoyo de las aspiraciones democr√°ticas del pueblo cubano.","status",NA,NA,13,10,1,1,0,0,1,1

The citrus industry, the heart of our state's economy, will require significant federal support after an estimated $760 million in damage. The supplemental request simply does not provide the assistance that Florida‚Äôs farmers, producers, and growers need and deserve.

Dr. Cardet is a leader within Cuba‚Äôs Christian Liberation Movement (MCL) and a physician who worked in a health center in Velasco until he was expelled due to his pro-democracy activities.  According to accounts provided by MCL members, Dr. Cardet suffered severe beatings at the time of his arrest and during his subsequent detention.  Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Freedom House, and Directorio Democratico Cubano have condemned his imprisonment.   Dr. Cardet‚Äôs imprisonment highlights the continued repression suffered by those who dare to express opposition to the Castro regime.  Prior to an important JusticeCuba event in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, which I attended, the Castro regime prohibited Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez from leaving Cuba to personally attest to lawmakers the brutal repression that he has faced.  Just this month, dozens of the renowned Ladies in White, who march in support of political prisoners and their families, were detained on Sundays while on their way to Mass.  The repression must end, and innocent activists such as Dr. Cardet, Antunez, and the Ladies in White must no longer endure these egregious human rights abuses simply for expressing opposition to tyranny.  --------------------------------  Hoy se cumple un a√±o desde el arresto del Dr. Eduardo Cardet, un l√≠der del Movimiento Cristiano de Liberaci√≥n (MCL) y m√©dico expulsado de su centro de salud por intentar promover la democracia. Seg√∫n el MCL, el Dr. Cardet ha sido brutalmente golpeado. Organizaciones de DDHH como Amnist√≠a Internacional, Freedom House y el Directorio Democr√°tico Cubano han condenado su encarcelamiento.  Por si alguien lo dudaba, el encarcelamiento de Cardet demuestra que el r√©gimen, que no ha dejado de reprimir en casi sesenta a√±os, no tiene la menor intenci√≥n de cambiar ahora. Seguir√° golpeando, encarcelando, torturando o asesinando a cualquiera que se le oponga. As√≠, lo mismo mantiene a Cardet en prisi√≥n por trabajar por la democracia, como proh√≠be la salida de Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez ‚ÄòAnt√∫nez‚Äô por denunciar al r√©gimen en foros internacionales, o golpea a las Damas de Blanco por manifestarse silenciosamente en contra del encarcelamiento injusto de sus familiares.  Es intolerable que el r√©gimen siga ensa√±√°ndose, no s√≥lo con activistas valientes como el Dr. Cardet, Ant√∫nez y las Damas de Blanco, sino con cualquier cubano que se oponga a su tiran√≠a. Estos cr√≠menes no quedar√°n impunes.  https://panampost.com/elena-toledo/2017/06/09/amnesty-international-demands-immediate-and-unconditional-release-of-cuban-political-prisoner-eduardo-cardet/","link","https://panampost.com/elena-toledo/2017/06/09/amnesty-international-demands-immediate-and-unconditional-release-of-cuban-political-prisoner-eduardo-cardet/","panampost.com",15,6,26,0,0,0,9,0

Brightline's first phase, which is set to begin full service in the coming days, will showcase an alternative and efficient mode of travel for Floridians and visitors alike. Connecting South and Central Florida passengers via rail offers expanded business and leisure opportunities, and I am glad that DOT acknowledges the potential in the future of our state's transit.

However, additional assistance is required to support the long-term recovery efforts of states and localities. I have seen firsthand the damage areas like Everglades City, Chokoloskee, and Immokalee have suffered as a result of Hurricane Irma, and they will need significant resources to fully recover. Funding from programs like CDBG-DR are essential to cover the unmet needs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) were not able to address. Within this account is a new mitigation set-aside that will help prepare our communities for future natural disasters, of which Florida will receive over $200 million. Resilient construction is a key step to preparing our homes for natural disasters, and this mitigation investment is important to minimizing expenses in the future. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to assist Florida and our country as our hometowns rebuild from the storms, and we must ensure we provide them with the adequate resources they deserve.  https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/18/house-to-unveil-massive-81-billion-disaster-aid-package-303544","link","https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/18/house-to-unveil-massive-81-billion-disaster-aid-package-303544","politico.com",2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
