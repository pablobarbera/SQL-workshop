Mattis responded that “he understands where I stand.”  During their exchange, Shaheen also asked him about the importance of National Guard readiness, highlighting the challenges that the New Hampshire National Guard faces with resources, training rotations, equipment and other aspects of readiness. “We have to keep the National Guard and the reserves of all the armed forces at the top of their game,” Gen. Mattis replied, noting that “as an operational reserve and strategic reserve [the National Guard] will be critical.” Shaheen also highlighted previous comments made by Gen. Mattis regarding the military’s dependence on fossil fuels and pushed Gen. Mattis on whether he will “continue to support the military’s effort to pursue alternative and more efficient sources of energy to reduce our reliance on conventional fuel supplies.” Gen. Mattis replied that they will “take advantage of every advance in terms… extending our energy efforts.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorShaheen/videos/1426139180751882/",NA,108,10,11,4,0,0,0,0

Experts testified on the disproportional impact that ACA repeal would have on low- and middle-income families in New Hampshire. They also drew attention to the expanded coverage provided for mental health and substance misuse treatment, which has been vital as the state combats the opioid epidemic, as well as for the management of diabetes and other diseases. Providers also highlighted the harmful effects of repeal, which hospital administrators have already factored into investments for the future of their practices. Repealing the ACA and the corresponding compensation structure would disrupt hospitals and healthcare providers’ ability to plan ahead.  Just following the round table discussion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on the Republicans’ plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The report estimated that by repealing the ACA without a replacement, 32 million people would lose healthcare coverage by 2026, with nearly 18 million Americans losing coverage in the first year of enactment. Premiums in individual markets would about double by 2026.  This is what Senator Shaheen had to say about today's events: ""The message from these New Hampshire healthcare experts is clear: the ACA has made our state healthier and a wholesale repeal would be devastating for all those Granite Staters who have coverage thanks to the law. Today’s CBO report underscores the recklessness of Republican leadership and President-elect Trump’s efforts to repeal this law, especially with no prepared replacement. Nearly 1 out of every 10 Granite Staters rely on coverage afforded by the ACA for vital preventative health services like cancer screenings, blood pressure monitoring and contraceptives, and many other healthcare services that are critical to long-term health and wellbeing. I will continue to encourage President-elect Trump and Republican leadership in Congress to work across the aisle to improve this law, rather than risk unnecessary chaos and uncertainty in the lives of millions of American families.""","status",NA,NA,198,40,15,1,0,5,7,2

Many are seeking refuge here because their lives have been threatened for helping our troops and diplomats. To abandon them now would be a stain on our national honor.

When women and girls have access to an education and critical healthcare, including family planning, this unleashes their ability to participate equally in their communities, in the workplace, and in the political arena. – J.S.","link","http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/news/a43694/jeanne-shaheen-interview-international-womens-day/","elle.com",368,20,27,35,0,1,0,0

Despite their many promises to the contrary, President Trump and House Republicans are pushing a bill that would severely undermine healthcare coverage for millions of Americans. It would also be a devastating blow to our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. On top of taking health insurance away from millions of Americans, the House Republican plan decimates the Medicaid program, increases premiums for seniors and older Americans, forces the middle class to pay more for less, and defunds vital preventative and reproductive care for women.    Mind you, not everyone is hurt by this bill: Insurance company CEOs get a special tax break. That’s right, hidden in the Republican health care bill is a special tax break that allows Health Care companies to write off CEO pay over $500,000 a year. What’s more outrageous is that this tax break for CEOs is paid for by charging senior citizens an additional $7,000 a year for health care. This bill is a tax giveaway to the wealthy, masquerading as health care reform. It’s shameful.  In dozens of visits to New Hampshire during the campaign, President Trump promised to provide treatment to end the opioid crisis. So why is he pushing for healthcare repeal and many other policies that would take away substance misuse treatment and many other resources that New Hampshire desperately needs to fight the drug epidemic? That’s exactly the question I put to him in a letter last week. In it, I call on the President to keep his promise to communities across New Hampshire that are fighting this epidemic with everything they have. I’ll keep you updated and let you know if President Trump responds.   As I’ve said many times, the Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect, but it has undoubtedly made New Hampshire healthier and has helped expand substance misuse treatment coverage to those who desperately need it. In New Hampshire, the uninsured rate has dropped by 43%. A big part of that reduction comes from the coverage provided through Medicaid expansion. Instead of repealing this progress, House Republicans should be working across the aisle to improve the Affordable Care Act. In the last congress, I successfully improved the law to help small businesses. I’ve proven that bipartisan progress on healthcare is possible. This is the much better route for the health, well-being, and peace of mind of Granite Staters. I’m strongly against this reckless repeal bill and I’ll be urging my colleagues in the Senate to oppose it. - J.S.","status",NA,NA,360,81,133,5,0,7,24,71

Under this bill, insurance companies could discriminate on a wide-range of conditions and circumstances, including history of cancer, heart disease, C-sections, postpartum depression and even being the victim of sexual assault or domestic violence. It also eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood, jeopardizing access to vital preventative care services that more than 12,000 Granite State women rely on to live healthy lives, care for their families, and lead in the workforce.   It’s also unconscionable that, as New Hampshire battles one of the worst public health crises in our state’s history, this legislation eliminates coverage for mental health and substance misuse treatment that is critical to our response to the opioid epidemic.

Today, Secretary Price said the Trump administration’s focus is to provide coverage and care to every American, but his words don’t match the administration’s actions. The Republican leadership’s healthcare repeal bill decimates Medicaid, and eliminates the program’s expansion and the federal requirement that insurance plans cover substance misuse treatment.

The Mexico City Policy bans federal funds for international non-governmental organizations that provide provide information about abortion or provide abortion services as part of family planning services:   Today, the Trump administration confirmed our worst fears regarding this new, drastically expanded global gag executive order. This administration's pathetic rebranding of this policy ‎is a thinly-veiled attempt to hide the tremendous harm it has around the world. President Trump's dangerous obsession with rolling back reproductive rights has severe consequences for millions of vulnerable women and children, and grossly undermines our nation's humanitarian leadership around the globe. We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are easily accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and abortions. Yet the Trump administration has chosen to ignore decades of research in favor of an ideological crusade that cuts off vital family planning services. President Trump’s actions have already had a chilling effect on international humanitarian efforts, preventing cooperation on a wide range of life-saving work to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, Zika and other preventable diseases. Today's announcement underscores the need for Congress to pass my bipartisan Global HER Act to repeal this global gag policy once and for all. – J.S.","status",NA,NA,73,20,16,1,0,0,15,37

Like many of you, I’ve been very disturbed by news of President Trump’s actions and behavior, particularly reports that he may have tried to undermine investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and potentially turned over highly classified information to Russian officials in a private meeting. There should be a bipartisan agreement to get to the bottom of this. I’m encouraged that, finally, these latest revelations have spurred a few Republicans to join Democrats in calling for an independent investigation. But frankly, we need many more Republicans in Congress to put country above party and support the appointment of an independent counsel. Americans have a right to know the full story about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, and they need assurance that our government is taking steps to prevent it from happening again.   In addition to an independent investigation, we need former FBI Director James Comey to testify again before Congress in a public hearing and I strongly support efforts to subpoena documents that detail his communications with President Trump. These documents could go a long ways towards determining the nature of President Trump’s discussions with Director Comey. Last week, after it was revealed that Director Comey was fired soon after requesting additional funding for the FBI’s Russia investigation, I sent a letter with Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to the Department of Justice requesting the specifics of this request and how it was processed. It’s critical that the FBI receives the needed personnel and resources to conduct this investigation thoroughly.    Finally, I’ve been calling on the administration to conduct a classified briefing so that Congress understands specifically what classified information was disclosed to Russian officials. The United States has many important relationships with allies who contribute to our national security by sharing intelligence about terrorists and other threats to our country. It’s been reported that the information the President provided to the Russians was shared by Israel, a key ally. It’s important to note that Russia is allied with Iran and Syria, both countries that call for the destruction of Israel. Sharing intelligence with adversaries undermines our critical relationships, compromises sources of intelligence in the field, and, ultimately, threatens our national security.   As a member of both the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, I will continue to call for accountability and oversight of the Trump administration on these critical matters of national security.

I began my day at Catholic Medical Center (CMC), a not-for-profit full-service acute care hospital that has implemented several programs to help care for patients with substance use disorders. The Affordable Care Act, and Medicaid expansion in particular, has been a critical tool in New Hampshire’s fight against the opioid epidemic, securing access to treatment for nearly 11,000 people struggling with substance use disorders. While I was at CMC I discussed my opposition to President Trump’s efforts to repeal Obamacare and his budget released last week. Both of these efforts would have catastrophic impacts in New Hampshire, jeopardizing the hard-won gains we have made in fighting the opioid epidemic.   Next, I visited Lamprey Health Care in Raymond, to discuss the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which would be drastically cut by the President’s budget. I heard from Sarah from Lee, who has two kids who are patients at Lamprey. Her daughter has an eye disease that requires expensive infusions every 8 weeks to maintain her eye sight. She told me that she's terrified she will have to choose between buying insurance and her daughter's eye sight if CHIP is cut. That is not a decision that any parent should be forced to make.   I ended the day at Idlehurst Elementary School to learn about after-school activities that are funded by the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program which is eliminated in President Trump’s budget.

On the back of those public investments, a private company - East Coast Flightcraft of NH – has launched into an impressive redevelopment of Winnipesaukee Pier. Tourism is the second largest industry in New Hampshire, supporting more than 60,000 Granite State jobs. Yet the Trump administration’s budget would cut important funding for tourism promotion programs, like Brand USA, that are critical for the Granite State economy.  Next I visited Navigating Recovery’s new facility in Laconia and thanked them for their great work. Navigating Recovery provides valuable peer-to-peer support center for those with substance use disorders, many of whom rely on the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid for access to care. Obamacare – Medicaid expansion in particular – has been a critical tool in our state’s fight against the opioid epidemic, securing access to treatment for nearly 11,000 people struggling with substance use disorders. The House bill to repeal Obamacare, and now the Trump budget, would have catastrophic impacts in NH, jeopardizing the hard-won gains we have made in fighting this crisis.

The fundamentals of this repeal bill have not changed: it would drive up premium costs, eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions, leave millions of working families without coverage, and would undermine our efforts in New Hampshire to combat the opioid epidemic. This legislation still decimates Medicaid and the program’s expansion, which has been a critical tool to providing more substance misuse treatment in New Hampshire, and supports thousands of Granite State children and seniors in nursing homes. The additional funding in this bill for the opioid epidemic doesn’t come close to compensating for the treatment resources that this same bill eliminates.   This bill still eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood, jeopardizing access to vital primary and preventative care services that more than 12,000 Granite State women rely on to live healthy lives, care for their families, and lead in the workforce. Once again, this legislation was an entirely partisan exercise, negotiated behind closed doors with no effort to include input from the other side of the aisle. I will continue to fight this reckless repeal effort and urge my Republican colleagues to work across the aisle to make needed fixes to the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it, so that more Americans have affordable, accessible healthcare. -- J.S.","status",NA,NA,104,26,12,3,0,2,2,7

I know I speak for all Granite Staters when I say that we stand with people in Sutherland Springs, Texas as they deal with the heartbreaking loss of so many family and community members. As more of these horrific incidents occur around the country, it’s easy to grow numb and complacent, but it’s so important that we not accept this violence as normal and continue to urge action to prevent the next tragedy.  Today, I helped introduce bipartisan legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. The mass murderer in Sutherland Springs was able to purchase firearms because of a loophole that kept his record of domestic violence from appearing in his background check. Had this information been provided by the military, the sale could not have legally gone through. My legislation gets rid of that loophole by requiring the Armed Services to report misdemeanors of domestic violence so that they appear in the federal background check system.   We know that domestic violence is a red flag for further violence. More than 55% of all female homicides are the victims of their intimate partners. I find that statistic just staggering. Congress urgently needs to take steps to ensure violent abusers are barred from purchasing guns. It’s my hope that we can build on the bipartisan support my legislation already has and pass it in Congress, and look at other ways to protect the public from senseless violence.   The vast majority of Granite Staters agree that we need sensible gun laws in place that don’t infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners.

Fundamentally, this just isn’t tax reform and that’s very disappointing. As every tax filer knows, we need to simplify the tax code. We also need to give a real tax break to the middle class and small businesses. Here’s what the Republican tax bill does instead:   • Most families who make less than $75,000 a year will pay more in taxes by 2027. And according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, by 2019, Americans earning less than $30,000 a year would be worse off. By 2021, Americans earning $40,000 or less would be at a net loss.   • This bill would lead to $25 billion in cuts from Medicare harming seniors.   • It repeals parts of Obamacare which will raise healthcare costs and leave more Americans uninsured. The American people have said over and over that they’re strongly opposed to repealing healthcare, yet this bill is another backdoor attempt to undo the healthcare law.   • It prevents homeowners in New Hampshire from deducting property taxes – a real blow to middle-class families.  • Work-study students at colleges and universities would see a steep tax increase which will make college even more unaffordable and discourage higher learning.  • The House version of the bill no longer allows college students and graduates to deduct student loan interest. New Hampshire has the highest student loan burden per capita in the country and this provision would make it worse.  Not everyone does poorly in this bill: big corporations and the wealthy get a massive, permanent tax break which is paid for by the middle class and adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt. Talk about misplaced priorities. And by one estimate, President Trump himself could benefit by as much as $1 billion under this plan.   This bill is a real missed opportunity. Again, Congress should be prioritizing bipartisan reform that delivers real relief to Granite Staters. As this debate continues, I’ll be urging Congress to reverse course and put the middle class first. -- J.S.","status",NA,NA,410,249,193,7,5,8,69,150
