My brother and I were pulled over by the police in broad daylight. Suddenly there were five police cars surrounding us. My car was turned inside out without reason. I was questioned belligerently by the police. And we were asked, ""what gang are you a member of?"" I remember it like it was yesterday.  This is a reality for many Latino men. And right now, it‚Äôs Daniel Ramirez Medina‚Äôs living hell.  I have serious concerns about the way Mr. Ramirez Medina is being treated. I‚Äôm even more irate over the ICE agent‚Äôs alleged comment that because Mr. Ramirez Medina wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòborn in this country,‚Äô it didn‚Äôt matter that he is a legal DACA recipient.   This incident is a clear example of the deep-rooted, fundamental problems in our system ‚Äì especially when it comes to immigration and criminal justice. Not everyone in our country receives fair and just treatment.   ICE‚Äôs detainment of Mr. Ramirez Medina, in addition to their LA-based raids and their general lack of transparency, leads me to assume the worst ‚Äì that this Administration has unleashed a chain of events that will diminish the safety of our country and the stability of our economy for American citizens and immigrants. The Trump Administration has decided to disregard the dignity of our friends and neighbors.  Is it the new Administration‚Äôs policy to disregard a person‚Äôs legal, government-issued work and residency documents, simply if they weren‚Äôt born here? Will we continue to see raids on our communities tearing parents away from their children? Are DACA Recipients and DREAMers in danger? Can we take President Trump at his word that DACA recipients ""shouldn‚Äôt be very worried"" because he has ""a big heart""?  As an elected public servant, I demand answers to these questions, and I will not be silent until I have answers.","link","http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ice-daca-20170214-story.html","latimes.com",91,15,25,4,1,3,10,20

I voted NO on #HR38 because it makes it more difficult for police to do their job. #HR38 is opposed by law enforcement, 17 attorneys general, mayors across the country, and healthcare professionals.","status",NA,NA,47,37,20,3,3,3,4,37

This bill would increase taxes on 86 million middle class families.   This sham drives up the deficit on the American people. Republicans have given their big donors everything & working people nothing. They are sticking our children and grandchildren with the debt. While wildfires continue to rage in California, Republicans in Congress have steamrolled the Tax Scam, punishing families that lose their homes to catastrophes by eliminating the ability to deduct their losses.   A majority of Americans oppose this bill. My Republican colleagues should have listened to the American people instead of their donors. They have stolen from American taxpayers‚Äô stockings to leave massive gifts under their corporate donors‚Äô trees.","status",NA,NA,166,46,13,15,2,1,2,10

I have been making sure first responders get federal help to contain the fires, and I am still working to deliver the resources LA needs to rebuild.   Throughout my face-to-face meetings and communications with the FEMA Administrator and his staff, I have urged the Administration to take proactive steps in preparation for Governor Brown‚Äôs requests as our communities work to react and rebuild.   Today, I am incredibly disappointed in the Republican majority. They have failed to advocate for responsible solutions that guarantee Californians receive the funding we need. Instead, this week Republican leadership passed a bill that gave tax cuts to billionaires, kicked the government funding can a couple weeks down the road instead of working out a bipartisan agreement, and once again failed to provide adequate resources to communities that are hurting. For this reason, I could not support the supplemental bill. Rest assured I will keep working to secure the resources and dignity our communities deserve.","status",NA,NA,50,10,6,0,0,0,6,1
