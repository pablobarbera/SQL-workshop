Our proposal uses the free market to lower drug costs, incentivize competition among drug makers, and help get treatments to patients faster.","link","http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/gus-bilirakis-wants-expand-generic-drug-production","sunshinestatenews.com",61,23,3,0,0,0,0,0

The problem is that when a constituent calls the office to ask about the status of a claim for benefits, the only thing we can do is contact the VA and wait for the agency to respond. I know I get very frustrated, and I’m sure my colleagues and the Veteran do as well, with how long it takes for the VA to respond. If signed into law, the WINGMAN Act provides a common sense solution, allowing congressional offices like mine to look up the status of the claim in the VA’s database, with the Veteran's permission. http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/ted-yohos-wingman-va-reform-proposal-passes-house","link","http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/ted-yohos-wingman-va-reform-proposal-passes-house","sunshinestatenews.com",73,11,13,5,0,0,0,0

With this legislation, we will lower costs, increase options, and empower patients to make their own health care choices in a system that works for all.","link","https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/","housegop.leadpages.co",46,81,13,2,0,0,1,20

We are human beings. We are parents, husbands, wives, sons, and daughters. If we take away anything from the events that transpired this morning, it is to be kind to one another. I pray for the swift recoveries of Zachary Barth, Matt Mika, Special Agent David Bailey, Special Agent Crystal Griner, and my good friend Congressman Steve Scalise. My deep gratitude goes to the heroic police officers on the scene.   Everybody on that baseball field this morning was a public servant, dedicated to the good of the nation. We may all sometimes disagree with one another on policy and politics, and in this wonderful country, we have every right to peacefully express our disagreements.  But in the days and weeks ahead, as we learn more about what exactly happened today, I believe we need to change the tone, and be more civil in our political discourse. We should all strive for this, and I will recommit myself to setting the best example possible. I hope you will join me.   The Congressional Baseball Game, a 100-year-old tradition taking place tomorrow, is exactly what we need. Democrats and Republicans, friends from both sides of the aisle, coming together and playing baseball to raise money for charity. This horrible violence will not divide us, and it will not deter me in my duty to serve my constituents and my country. Let us come together as Americans above all else, and keep those affected by today’s events in our prayers.","status",NA,NA,249,65,28,26,0,0,17,3

Federal and state officials are working together to address the fuel shortage.  There is currently a fuel ship en route from a refinery in Mississippi to the Port of Tampa for resupply. A military escort is meeting the shipment at the port. This is in addition to a ship currently in Tampa that is unloading more than 300,000 barrels of fuel to resupply gas stations in the evacuation zones.  Additionally, Publix has informed us that they are continuing to restock their shelves and will keep the website below updated throughout the coming days to share information about store closures:  http://www.publix.com/pages/publix-storm-basics/publix-store-status.    My office has also received some questions from Veterans about availability of their medications.  If Veterans have questions or concerns about their medications, the Health Resource Disaster Hotline is 1-800-507-4571. For non-emergency healthcare-related questions, Veterans are encouraged to call the VISN 8 TelCare line at 1-877-741-3400.

Some key information from FEMA’s website is listed below:  • Home/Primary Residence: We provide housing assistance     to individuals who have lost their homes as a result of an eligible disaster.  If you are a renter or homeowner you may qualify for assistance.  By law, FEMA assistance cannot duplicate the assistance you receive from your insurance company, but you may receive assistance for items not covered by insurance.   • Business: We do not offer assistance for small businesses impacted by a presidentially-declared disaster.  However, we do partner with the Small Business Administration (SBA), which offers low interest loans for business damages.   • Secondary Home: We do not offer assistance for your secondary home.  • Other Needs Assistance: We offer disaster assistance for some of your other disaster-caused expenses including, medical and dental, child care, funeral and burial, essential household items, moving and storage, vehicle, and some clean-up items. • If you lost work due to a federally declared disaster, you may qualify for Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA). FEMA does not administer the DUA program. Please contact your local office of your State's Unemployment Commission for further information regarding DUA benefits. • FEMA does not compensate for evacuation expenses, even if the evacuation was mandatory; however, if your home was damaged to the extent you could not return for an extended period of time, some lodging may be reimbursable.  • Food loss is not covered by FEMA's Individual and Households Program (IHP).","link","http://www.disasterassistance.gov/","disasterassistance.gov",2,1,4,0,0,0,0,0

They provide disaster relief employment in the form of temporary jobs that support storm response and recovery efforts. Disaster relief employment pertains to projects that provide food, clothing, shelter and other humanitarian assistance for disaster victims and projects that involve demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation and reconstruction of damaged structures and facilities. Individuals who qualify for disaster relief employment are people who are temporarily or permanently laid off as a consequence of the disaster, dislocated workers, and individuals who are long-term unemployed. For information regarding National Dislocated Worker Grants, visit your local CareerSource Center at http://www.careersourceflorida.com/your-local-team.   In addition to the Dislocated Worker Grants, the state is also providing the following programs to assist in recovery from Hurricane Irma:   • The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) Program provides assistance to businesses and residents whose employment or self-employment was lost or interrupted as a result of Hurricane Irma. To apply for DUA, go to www.floridajobs.org or call the Florida Disaster Unemployment Assistance Line at 1-800-385-3920.  • The Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program provides cash flow to businesses damaged by a disaster. The short-term, interest-free loans help bridge the gap between the time damage is incurred and when a business secures other financial resources, including payment of insurance claims or longer-term Small Business Administration loans. Go to www.floridadisasterloan.org for more information.","link","http://www.careersourceflorida.com/your-local-team","careersourceflorida.com",12,1,13,0,0,0,0,0

FEMA and its federal partners continue to conduct 24-hour operations, aggressively conducting search and rescue operations, bringing additional essential commodities to the islands, and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports, and other critical facilities. While significant progress in being made in the response to Hurricane Maria, recovery for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will be long and frustrating, and will require the help of the whole community. As access to ports, airfields, and roads continue to open, more resources will flow into hard hit areas. Power is restored to Centro Médico Hospital in San Juan and San Pablo Hospital in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. The Governor Juan F. Luis Hospital in St. Croix and the Schneider Regional Medical Center in St. Thomas are re-energized and re-established as mobile hospitals. Ports continue to open to bring in commodities, communications support, and responders to address the needs of survivors on the islands of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, seven ports are currently open with restrictions, and eight airports are open. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, eight ports are open with restrictions, and two airports are open. Eight FEMA Urban Search & Rescue task forces are stationed and conducting operations in the Caribbean. FEMA US&R task forces have saved or assisted 516 individuals and two pets, while searching over 2,500 structures as of September 25.  FEMA encourages all residents to continue following the direction of commonwealth, territorial, and local officials. To donate or volunteer, contact the voluntary or charitable organization of your choice through the National Voluntary Agencies Active in Disasters (NVOAD). There are thousands of federal staff, including more than 600 FEMA personnel, on the ground in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands supporting response and recovery operations from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. The federal government is working with its interagency and private sector partners to support availability, transportation and delivery of fuel, based on priorities identified by Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The federal support for fuel transportation includes air and sea logistical support by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), U.S. Northern Command, the U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard, in coordination with the private sector. The ports of San Juan, Fajardo, Culebra, Guayanilla, Salinas, Tallaboa, and Vieques are now open for daylight operations in Puerto Rico. The ports of Crown Bay, East Gregerie Channel, West Gregerie Channel, and Redhook Bay on St. Thomas, the ports of Krause Lagoon, Limetree Bay, and Frederiksted on St. Croix, and the port of Cruz Bay on St. John are open with restrictions. FEMA, working in coordination with federal partners, provided has provided more than 1.5 million meals, 1.1 million liters of water, nearly 300 infant and toddler kits, and nearly 12,000 emergency roofing kits to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria’s landfall. Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS) communications assets and personnel continue to support FEMA Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT), Urban Search and Rescue (US&R), National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), and other federal teams in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An additional MERS team is scheduled to arrive Monday. More than 100 satellite phones are en route to Puerto Rico to help address communications needs on the ground. FEMA’s National Business Emergency Operations Center (NBEOC) is facilitating private sector requests for humanitarian relief. The NBEOC continues coordination between government and private sector organizations as the community responds to Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Other federal agencies are taking the following actions:  • The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an order on September 24 authorizing FEMA and DoD to install and operate temporary water treatment units to provide clean water in the U.S. Virgin Islands to address concerns about a lack of clean alternative water supplies. • Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the DoD conducted medical evacuations for more than 150 patients from the islands to the continental United States. Medical evacuations from the islands will continue.  • A U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) mobile communications team arrived in Puerto Rico to help improve communications across the storm-impacted area. USCG personnel continue to deliver critical FEMA relief supplies to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. • The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) deployed debris experts to assist FEMA with debris management strategies in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands completed a Blue Roof install on Cyril E. King Airport on St. Thomas, and completed its first residential Blue Roof install on September 23. Installations began on St. Croix Sunday, September 24. • Additionally, USACE has 86 generators on hand in Puerto Rico and St. Thomas with more than 186 additional generators en route. USACE and other supporting agencies have completed nine temporary power installs on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and completed more than 100 inspections.  • Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations personnel are onsite in St. Thomas to evaluate, fix, and install FAA equipment, in support of air traffic control operations. • The National Guard Bureau (NGB) has thousands of Guard members on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands taking part in security and support operations. The Air National Guard is focused on transporting food, water, and communications capabilities as well as rapidly increasing airlift into affected areas.  • Customs and Border Protection airplanes and helicopters are assisting with conducting damage assessment and search and rescue missions. • More than 180 Federal Law Enforcement Officers are in San Juan and the U.S. Virgin Islands supporting search and rescue, medical teams, and other federal responders.

Gus Bilirakis","2017-09-27","2017-09-27 17:06:21","Based upon the questions that are coming into my office from victims of Irma, I wanted to share the following information about available federal resources:  •       You only have until November 9, 2017 to apply for FEMA or SBA aid.   •       Insurance deductibles must be met before FEMA assistance is available (SBA loans can be used to help individuals or businesses pay for their insurance deductibles) •       There is no money available through FEMA for food replacement.  All food support must come through USDA.  The primary USDA programs are the food stamp replacement program (which has already been loaded onto EBT cards) and DSNAP (which has been approved for Pinellas, Pasco and Hillsborough counties).  To date, only Pinellas County has begun offering DSNAP assistance.  The Pinellas County program starts today.  Please visit this website for more information about times and locations to apply:    https://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/access/fff/siteLocations.shtml •       Residents of all zip codes in Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties are eligible for FEMA and SBA assistance •       FEMA assistance will not pay for damages to fences or other structures like detached garages (assistance for these non-house structures are only available through an SBA loan or through private insurance) •       FEMA’s goal is to make primary homes habitable again. •       FEMA aid may only be used for primary residences.  SBA loans are available for landlords to fix damages to their rental homes. •       Renters who lived in a damaged home that is no longer habitable may be eligible for temporary housing/relocation expenses through FEMA •        FEMA does not cover travel or lodging  expenses for individuals who evacuated during the storm.  Temporary housing funds are available only if your home is inhabitable.    •       Tree Removal is not an eligible FEMA expense •       Costs associated with preparation for the hurricane (boarding/shuttering of windows, etc.) are not eligible for FEMA reimbursement •       SBA offers low interest loans (for up to 30 years) for businesses and individuals affected by the hurricane.  Their goal is to bring people back up to the standard they were in prior to hurricane.  •       SBA does NOT offer grants.  They only offer loans. You can go to a Business Recovery Center (BRC) for help applying for a loan. The only BRC in the Tampa Bay area is located at 13805 58th Street N, Clearwater, FL  33760.  You may also call 1-800-659-2955.  This is not the FEMA line and does not have a long wait.   •       First payments for SBA loans are not due for 12 months and businesses can apply for loans up to $2 million.   •       If you need help from FEMA, you should go to the Disaster Recovery Center (DRC).  The only DRC in the Tampa Bay area is located at 6437 Watson Rd.  Riverview, FL  33578.  FEMA knows their toll free number has a wait of several hours.  They are working on providing additional resources to reduce wait times.   •       If you are an individual denied for FEMA assistance, you SHOULD definitely apply for a SBA loan, even if you do not want a loan or do not believe you will qualify for a loan (based on your credit and/or income).  This is because individuals who are denied for SBA loans may become eligible for additional FEMA aid, called Other Needs Assistance (ONA).  ONA covers personal property, moving and storage expenses, transportation and group flood policies.  •       Businesses denied for SBA loans are not eligible for additional assistance through FEMA. •       If you are an individual or a business having other issues with FEMA or SBA, you can call my office at 727-232-2921 to speak to a caseworker.  You must complete and return a privacy form, which will enable my staff to work with FEMA or the SBA on your specific case.","link","https://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/access/fff/siteLocations.shtml","dcf.state.fl.us",6,5,4,0,0,0,0,0

There were too many preventable tragedies throughout the country, especially those involving the death of seniors in facilities that did not appropriately plan to protect their vulnerable residents.  While less severe, we had several local incidents of seniors that went days without power.  I held a roundtable immediately after the hurricane to bring together stakeholders and discuss ways to prevent similar incidents in the future.  I shared those ideas as part of today’s hearing.

During my roundtable with key stakeholders after Hurricane Irma, several leaders suggested that while larger facilities could likely afford to comply, those with under 10 beds would likely have extreme difficulty purchasing the generators, back-up fuel and ensuring ongoing maintenance of the equipment.  Our primary goal must be to protect our seniors and the disabled.  These federal funds can help meet that moral imperative.","link","https://bilirakis.house.gov/media/bilirakis-blog/bilirakis-urges-florida-department-health-use-federal-dollars-protect-seniors","bilirakis.house.gov",18,11,0,1,0,0,0,0

First, it is important to note that the legislation was NOT an appropriations bill. It did not provide money for or take away money from any program. It simply was a broad framework to provide discretionary caps for the FY 2018 budget and set up tax reform through the reconciliation process.  Federal money is allocated through a separate funding bill. Secondly, the framework did NOT propose a reduction in spending for Medicaid or Medicare.  It proposed a non-binding reduction in the long-term projected increases for these programs. Countless independent studies have shown that reform is needed for both programs in order to ensure their long-term sustainability.  I support a bi-partisan study commission which will make recommendations about how to best achieve that goal while protecting seniors and vulnerable populations.  Despite political rhetoric, all members of Congress (Republican and Democrat) understand the importance of these programs and will work to ensure that they remain solvent for years to come.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/GusBilirakis/photos/a.196462210383941.52954.135445766485586/1827303643966448/?type=3",NA,42,45,12,1,0,1,0,15

It also contributes to the stability of our community, which is why I am glad the bill maintains current mortgage deductions.  This bill also preserves the charitable donation exemption.  Additionally, the bill protects retirement savings of hardworking Americans by keeping the exemption for 401k plans intact. This bill represents the most serious attempt to reform our tax code in over 20 years and it will make a positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans.  For example, a family of four making $59,000 will pay $1,182 less in taxes under the plan, than they would under the current tax code.

I am proud that Section 1103 of this bill includes language I introduced called the Stop Handouts to Unauthorized Taxpayers  (SHUT) Act.  This provision cracks down on fraud by requiring any individual who receives the refundable portion of the child tax credit to demonstrate their legal employment in the United States by providing a Social Security Number on their tax return.  The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in 2011 that illegal immigrants received $4.2 billion by claiming this child tax credit in 2010. It is estimated that this provision will reduce federal spending by $8.4 billion over two years. It is vital we stop wasteful and fraudulent spending to get our nation’s fiscal course back on track.

Today's misperception:  “This raises taxes on people in the lowest income bracket, as well as people in the 33% bracket that exists today.”   That’s not true. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces taxes for Americans at every income level.  This bill nearly doubles the standard deduction so more Americans in the lowest tax bracket of 12% – individuals earning up to $45,000 and married couples earning up to $90,000 – will pay zero income tax.  And because we lower the rates and increase the amount of income subject to those lower rates, Americans in the new 35% bracket – individuals earning up to $500,000 and married couples earning up to $1 million – will benefit from the significantly larger standard deduction and lower 25% rate so they will keep even more of their hard-earned money.","status",NA,NA,107,154,33,10,13,0,1,24

The eHealth bill expands the use of telemedicine to provide better care to Veterans by addressing licensure issues that were limiting this successful program.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help Americans afford the care they need by lowering tax rates across the board, roughly doubling the standard deduction, preserving the dependent care credit, and creating a new family credit that will help millions more families.  With these provisions, Americans will be able to keep more of the money they earn for expenses that arise throughout their lives – including medical bills.  Additionally, this bill is estimated to create nearly 1 million new jobs and increase paychecks by 3.1% – broadening the tax base and increasing revenues, which not only helps working seniors but also has the added benefit of ultimately improving the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund so the Medicare program can continue to serve today’s seniors and future generations.","status",NA,NA,22,97,11,1,0,1,0,23

Gus Bilirakis","2017-11-15","2017-11-15 19:06:00","Today's misconception about the tax bill:  “This bill raises taxes for people with student loans. By eliminating Americans’ ability to deduct their student loan interest, the average borrower will see their taxes go up by $275 each year – just on student loan interest. And a borrower who pays the full $2,500 in interest would see their taxes go up even more – by a whopping $625.”   FACT:  This claim looks at one deduction in isolation and fails to take into account the tax relief and economic benefits that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide Americans of all walks of life – including people working to pay off student loans.  In fact, while the deduction for student loan interest provides some tax relief today for some people, under this bill, people paying the interest on student loans will receive substantially more tax relief. The typical household making $59,000 each year will receive $1,182 of tax relief each year. The typical single person making $30,000 right out of college will receive over $800 of tax relief each year – more than they would receive from the existing deduction for student loan interest.  The bill consolidates the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), the Hope Scholarship Credit (HSC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) into an enhanced AOTC. The new AOTC would provide a 100% tax credit for the first $2,000 of certain higher education expenses and a 25% tax credit for the next $2,000 of such expenses. Expenses covered include tuition, fees, and course materials. This provides a max tax credit of $2,500 for education.   The new AOTC would also be available for a fifth year of post-secondary education at half the rate as the first four years, with up to $500 of the credit being refundable.   And let’s look at the bigger picture: this bill is estimated to create nearly 1 million new jobs and increase paychecks by 3.1% – providing college graduates with career opportunities that don’t exist under today’s slow-growing economy.  It’s this job creation and wage growth, along with the specific tax relief, that will help more young people pay off their loans even faster – especially compared with the slow-growing economy Americans have been forced to settle for in recent years.","status",NA,NA,26,102,8,1,9,2,3,31

The referenced CBO information is not an analysis of the tax bill, but rather a direct response to a member of Congress who asked what the hypothetical impact would be on Medicare if a bill passed that increased the deficit by $1.5 trillion.  The question was generic in nature and not specific to the tax reform package currently under consideration.  CBO indicated that if additional measures were not taken by Congress, an increase to the deficit of this amount would automatically trigger an across the board cut known as sequestration, which would impact payments to Medicare providers.   Additional action will be taken to ensure the hypothetical scenario described by the CBO never comes to fruition.   I understand the importance of Medicare and will continue working to do everything in my power to preserve it.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/GusBilirakis/photos/a.196462210383941.52954.135445766485586/1843595185670627/?type=3",NA,24,65,3,0,4,2,1,17

For over a decade, I have worked together in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues to condemn violations of religious freedom on behalf of the Falun Gong in China, Amadi in Pakistan, Baha’is in Iran, and so many other religious minorities worldwide. But, the single most persecuted group according to the U.S. State Department are Christians, particularly in the Middle East. Christians are suffering, dying and being displaced from their ancestral homelands at this moment. While we may not be able to eradicate every act of violence and persecution, we can surely work to extinguish international indifference.  We can give voice to those who are silenced. Martin Luther King famously said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”   Embattled Christians and other religious minorities are counting on us to come to their defense. They cannot afford to wait any longer.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/GusBilirakis/photos/a.196462210383941.52954.135445766485586/1866852933344852/?type=3",NA,24,30,3,6,3,0,1,2

Out of respect for the sovereign decision-making of Israel, the United States Congress passed The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, a bipartisan law requiring America to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, the Executive Branch has ignored this legislative directive for over two decades. During my time in Congress, I have consistently supported legislation reinforcing the law and Jewish historical, religious, and cultural ties to Jerusalem. In fact, one of my first actions in Congress was to co-introduce bipartisan legislation that would require the U.S. government to take tangible steps towards recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I applaud President Trump’s historic announcement today that he intends to honor the wishes of our strongest ally in the Middle East and implement this long-standing Congressional directive by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to initiate relocating the U.S. embassy there. Lasting peace can only be achieved through direct negotiations between Israelis and the Palestinians and today’s announcement does not presume an outcome to those negotiations. Rather, today’s announcement ensures Jerusalem will continue to be Israel’s capital as part of any final-status agreement between the two parties despite the concerted effort of nefarious international influence to deny Jewish links to the ancient city.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/06/trump-officially-recognizes-jerusalem-as-israels-capital-orders-us-embassy-move.html","foxnews.com",91,73,20,22,0,0,1,28

The United States must remain steadfast in its support of Greece, continue to condemn flagrant acts in violation of international law, and be prepared to respond quickly and forcefully to transgressions of international law through targeted sanctions and foreign aid restrictions.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/turkeys-erdogan-heads-to-athens-for-official-greece-visit/2017/12/07/86e3e688-db2a-11e7-a241-0848315642d0_story.html?utm_term=.a8bd4e3d1b68","washingtonpost.com",6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0

This historic tax reform will double the standard deduction, lower tax rates for all income brackets and dramatically increases the child tax credit, which will help millions of middle class Americans keep more of their hard earned money. The increase in the standard deduction will also simplify the tax system, as fewer people will itemize, saving families time and money on tax preparation.  However, the bill preserves the most important deductions that many Americans depend upon including:  student loan interest, mortgage interest, teacher supplies, medical expenses, retirement savings and $10,000 worth of state and local taxes.  Additionally, the bill includes pro-growth policies that will benefit our economy for years to come.  For example, it dramatically reduces the tax burden on small businesses, which are the job creators of America and the backbone of our economy.  The package also removes the fine levied against Americans who do not have health insurance, which is a matter of fairness.  This bill is good for our country and for average, hard-working Americans.  By supporting it, I am honoring a commitment I made to voters to deliver meaningful, immediate tax relief.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-passes-gop-tax-overhaul-bill-1513711679","wsj.com",150,263,15,24,2,1,7,171

Gus Bilirakis","2017-12-20","2017-12-20 15:47:32","In yesterday’s Veterans Affairs Committee, we passed the VA Care in the Community Act, which reauthorizes and fixes a variety of problems in the CHOICE program. Many of these issues, such as prompt payment, have been highlighted as concerns by local Veterans.  I am pleased to share their experiences with my colleagues in Washington and to ensure the inclusion of remedies for those concerns in this legislative package. The CHOICE program is designed to ensure Veterans receive quality treatment, close to their home within a timely manner. We must assure that problems are addressed so that this goal can be achieved.  I am also pleased that an amendment I offered was incorporated prior to the bill’s favorable passage in committee. My amendment ensures that those providers who have been convicted of fraud within Medicare or Medicaid will not be allowed to participate in providing care to our nation’s heroes.  These protections are afforded to those in the private sector, so it only makes sense to provide these same assurances to our true American heroes.
