She arrived at the University of California Berkeley from India in 1959 with dreams of becoming a scientist. The plan, when she finished school, was to go back home to a traditional Indian marriage. But when she met my father Donald Harris, she made a different plan. She went against a practice reaching back thousands of years, and instead of an arranged marriage, chose a love marriage. This, an act of self-determination, made me and my sister Maya. And - like millions of the children of immigrants before and since - it made us Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKamalaHarris/photos/a.425643741112098.1073741828.343657505977389/425642674445538/?type=3",NA,38820,2052,3901,12835,18,181,2,2

I fear that no one is going to care that I have a PhD or that I have lived in the United States for as long as I can remember. I was born in Apatzingan, Mexico, but Fresno is my home. My parents and I moved there before I started kindergarten. None of us had immigration papers. When I was growing up, my parents always told me that ‘no one can take away your education. The government may not give you papers, but they can’t take away your learning.’   There have been a lot of obstacles to getting to where I am now. When I went to college, I wasn’t eligible for the financial aid and scholarships other students were because of my status. It was very discouraging. When I graduated, I knew I wanted to pursue my PhD, but I didn’t qualify for work study programs for the same reason. I couldn’t bear to give up research, so for a full year after I graduated I worked in the lab for free.   I’ll never forget the day I heard the news about DACA. I was in the lab and I cried. It was emotional - knowing that I would actually be able to continue to work there, continue to do what I love. As soon as I was able, I applied to the University of California-Merced, where I graduated with a PhD from the Quantitative Systems Biology Program. I hope to one day have my own research lab where I can study sudden cardiac arrest syndrome.   The best part about my work?...

Treating all immigrants like criminals disparages the millions of incredibly hardworking and patriotic families who simply want a chance at the American dream.   The President failed to provide assurances to the 5 million Californians who rely on the Affordable Care Act for their health insurance. Let’s be clear – access to health care is not the guarantee of health care. The American people are counting on us to improve and build on what we’ve made, not go back to a time when insurance companies could discriminate against women or those with a preexisting condition.   And the President failed to speak to refugees, many of whom have been vetted for two years, but are now facing a country that denies them entry. I sat with refugees in California who were detained in airports for hours with their families and lawyers on the other side of a door. This is wrong and it makes us less safe.   The President said tonight that ""we are witnessing a renewal of the American spirit.""

An estimated 11 million gallons of oil spilled into the water, polluting 700 miles of coastline. Yesterday, President Trump decided to commemorate that anniversary in the worst way, by issuing a permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. Making matters worse – the president retreated from a demand that the pipeline be made of American steel. Other than put us at risk for another disaster, Keystone XL does little for our country. Instead of projects that only benefit Big Oil, we should focus on developing new, clean energy that creates good jobs.  http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-administration-issues-1490356163-htmlstory.html","link","http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-administration-issues-1490356163-htmlstory.html","latimes.com",800,137,400,15,1,29,389,1465

Alphonse sued and every judge ruled in his favor. Only one — Judge Gorsuch — sided with the company. Luckily, Alphonse won his case.

Mrs. Wilson was deeply committed to her students, a diverse group - ranging from kids growing up in housing projects to the children of people working at the university.  She stayed in touch with many of us throughout our lives, and when I graduated from Hastings College of the Law, Mrs. Wilson was in the audience. I would not have made it there without her.

I was moved to do something to help them and I did some research and realized that through 3D printing technology I was able could create two prosthetics for the children and instead of costing thousands of dollars it would cost just $30s.

At the time, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to afford to go to college, but I was very enthusiastic to be able to work and serve my community. For me, applying for DACA was a risk worth taking. I graduated from San Diego State University this year and started working at Alliance San Diego. We help the immigrant community with things like access to qualified legal services and assistance for naturalization. In my work and in my community, I see the toll that harsh immigration enforcement has every day. I think many times, in the midst of the rhetoric, we lose sight of the real impact these policies have on people’s lives.

Unequivocally, Russia interfered in our election and they will be back to interfere again.  2. Comey said he documented his conversation with Trump because he was concerned Trump would lie about their meetings. This is stunning.  3. Another key point: Comey told Rosenstein about his concerns about Trump meetings. Then, Rosenstein still wrote the memo justifying his firing. Rosenstein now oversees the special investigation run by Mueller, which is something we should be concerned about. Yesterday, I pushed Rosenstein to commit in writing that Mueller has full independence — otherwise the same thing may well happen to Mueller. I didn’t receive a sufficient yes or no answer to my question yesterday, but I will keep pushing for that answer, because — as former FBI Director Comey affirmed under oath today — Mueller should have full independence.

The plan was to go back home when she finished school, but when she met my father Donald Harris, she made a different plan. She went against a practice reaching back thousands of years, and instead of an arranged marriage, chose a love marriage. This, an act of self-determination, made me and my sister Maya.

Looking at that group, I couldn’t help but think of a young woman roughly the age of many of them. She was born in Chennai, in the south of India, where she had been a talented singer and a precocious student. And this young woman dreamed of becoming a scientist. She wanted to study at one of the top universities in the world, the University of California, Berkeley. She was only 19, but her father let her travel halfway around the world, with the agreement that when she finished school she would return home to a traditional Indian marriage. But at Berkeley, this young woman met a young man, also an immigrant. A top economics student from Jamaica. And so instead of an arranged marriage, she went against thousands of years of tradition and chose a love marriage. That woman was my mother, Shyamala Gopalan. It was a hard choice and a brave choice that she made, fueled by love and optimism. And so was the decision that each of them has made to become citizens.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKamalaHarris/photos/a.425643741112098.1073741828.343657505977389/508714276138377/?type=3",NA,5351,206,224,1408,4,26,1,4

One Oxford study suggests that as many as 47% of jobs are at high risk of automation in the next two decades. I’ve started meeting with economists, heads of colleges and universities, mayors, businesses and chambers, unions, and even sociologists to figure out how to address our workers with the changing economy. The reality is that automation has the ability to displace jobs, and we need to be telling the truth about that. Last week, I joined students, faculty members, and leaders at at InTech. For those of you who don’t know, InTech is a collaboration between California Steel, Chaffey College and others, uses a federal grant among other funding sources to train workers in robotics, welding, industrial maintenance and similar areas, with the goal of placing workers in fields where there’s a shortage of qualified applicants for high-paying jobs. It stands as a strong example of what we should be doing to strengthen our workforce and prepare workers for a changing economy. The Trump budget would cut workforce training by $1.3 billion.

I submitted to the government every aspect of my life – where I lived, where I studied, everything. I now feel betrayed, as if my country that I so dearly love doesn’t want me. I want people to judge me for the person I am and not on the fact that I don’t have a piece of paper that says I belong here. I’m pursuing an education and doing my best to help my community. I’m the youngest Rotarian in Placer County and am also a Placer County Youth Commissioner, which means I get to work with the Board of Supervisors and represent the youth in my community.

The name we have given to a population of 220,000 young people in California and many, many more around the country who were brought into the United States by their parents, many before they could walk or talk. They’ve only known this country as their home, and yes, they are undocumented immigrants. So, for these Dreamers, the Obama Administration set up a policy that said, let’s figure out who they are and depending on if they fit a certain criteria and clear extensive vetting, we’re going to defer their deportation. So, we went through asking these kids a bunch of questions, personal questions, about their background, the circumstances surrounding their arrival, who their parents are, whether they’ve committed any crimes, whether they’re living a productive life­— we asked them to do all of this, give us all that information, and we explicitly said, “If you give us this information so we can determine if you qualify, we will not share that information with ICE.” The Trump Administration has gone back on that promise. Right now, the issue of passing comprehensive immigration reform is a fight that is front and center. We cannot lose any steam on marching and shouting about the need to recognize a fundamental truth: unless you are a Native American, your people were immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants, and we have got to stop vilifying and criminalizing whole populations of people because they came and arrived here from south of the border.","status",NA,NA,2302,528,197,285,18,10,26,120

In an ideal world, what I am looking for from these nominees is a commitment to protecting Americans’ fundamental right to drink clean water and breathe clean air. That’s really what this all boils down to. I have grave concerns about two of the nominees we questioned today, Michael Dourson and Bill Wehrum. Their prior careers demonstrate that they are beholden to private industries and raise significant ethical concerns. And, I believe they do not take seriously the goal of protecting public health and the environment. Michael Dourson is a toxicologist who has been retained by private industry to produce “science” claiming a number of toxic substances are safe, and worked on behalf of the tobacco lobby on secondhand smoke. Bill Wehrum was a nominee to this same position in the Bush Administration who failed to be appointed because he did not receive Senate Approval. He has also advocated revoking California’s Clean Air Act waiver. Discussion of these nominees isn’t necessarily something you’re going to see on the news, but it’s important. In the coming weeks, the full Senate will vote on them. I urge everyone to make their voices heard.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/10/04/senate-to-weigh-key-epa-nominees-with-close-ties-to-chemical-fossil-fuels-industries/?utm_term=.3f0d1a06345a","washingtonpost.com",738,238,147,17,9,25,73,154

So today, I want to take a moment to talk a bit about who “DACA recipients” are. These are people ages 12 to 35, who were brought to this country as children by their parents. In most cases, the United States is the only country they know as home. They have played by the rules. Participating in the DACA means you place trust in our government by filing paperwork with your personal identification information. That’s a scary thing if you are undocumented and fear deportation. It’s a big risk to come out of the shadows. But our government has promised that in exchange for giving them your information and paying a sizeable fee, they won’t be deported and the information they provided about themselves and their families won’t be turned over to ICE. The government then vets you. Upon determining you have lived a lawful and productive life, you’ll receive “DACA status,” meaning you can live and work here or keep going to school here. DACA does not provide you a path to citizenship. Now, the Trump Administration has changed the rules on these kids. First, Trump has decided to end the DACA program. Second, this Administration has been giving mixed signals on whether they will share these young people’s information with ICE they won’t provide us with any written guidelines or guarantees. So, these young people have been left utterly terrified, living in fear of an ICE agent knocking on the door of their home or place of work – the address to which they turned over to the government freely, trusting in the promise that our government made to them. Third, this Administration has moved up the deadline for people to reapply for DACA status. That’s the deadline we’ve been talking about this week. The trouble with this is, DACA recipients have not been directly notified of the new deadline, and many have not had reasonable time to complete the application process or come up with the money to pay the fee. So, I’ve been doing all I can to push this Administration to extend the filing and payment deadline, and to spread the word about the deadline. But it’s pretty clear at this point that this Administration is not going to do that. So, now we must turn to the next solution, and that is passing the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is a bipartisan bill that offers these young people a path to citizenship.

I was concerned about this chemical in particular because the city of Santa Clarita, California has struggled with groundwater contamination from perchlorate for more than 50 years. Dourson was hired by companies that have used perchlorate to study this toxic chemical and he put together some bogus “science” that claimed the safe level would be eight times higher than what the EPA’s scientists determined would be safe. In 2013, the EPA’s own independent science advisory board asked him to recuse himself from perchlorate matters because of this conflict of interest. When you put it all into context it’s insane that he’s up to be the head of Chemical Safety in the EPA. So, when he sat before our committee I asked him, would he recuse himself from matters involving perchlorate? He evaded my question. I posed the question again. He evaded it a second time. Tomorrow, he’s being voted on by the full Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

However, it has become apparent that during the wildfires many Californians in harm’s way didn’t receive emergency alerts. This tool was not able to be used effectively, in part, because the messages could not be geotargeted. Local authorities need the ability to send alerts specifically to residents in certain areas, not just everyone in the county.

We should not explode the deficit and pull the rug out from the middle class to give billions to those who already have so much.   Under this bill, 572,000 tax payers making over $1 million a year will get $34 billion in tax cuts in a single year.
