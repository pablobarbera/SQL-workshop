That’s something worth fighting for — and that’s why I’m not backing down.   There are serious questions that must be answered about President-Elect Trump’s business dealings.

The data shows that the uninsured rate in Texas has fallen by 28% since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010, translating into 1,781,000 Texans gaining coverage. And, in addition to residents who would otherwise be uninsured, millions more Texans with employer, Medicaid, individual market, or Medicare coverage have also benefited from new protections as a result of the law.  Last night Senate Republicans voted to begin the process of repealing the ACA. A vote in the House on this same measure is expected this week which I will proudly oppose on behalf the 1,781,000 Texans who have gained coverage.  We cannot allow Republicans to repeal the ACA with no sensible alternative. We cannot allow them to #MakeAmericaSickAgain.

On November 8th 2016, many of us were deeply wounded and it was a very difficult time.  For me, the concern was for so many of my constituents who had worked so hard for a different result; and the many young people who were for the first time engaged in the democratic process that were seemingly so disappointed.  They were looking for hope.  After the election, although still very concerned, I was willing to give the President-elect the appropriate time, as he moved through his transition, to address the American people with a message of unity.  Unfortunately, the transition was not as smooth as I believe many of us, as Americans, would have wanted it to be.  The call for unity and the embracing of all Americans simply did not come.  The moments of attack continued.  However, many of us still continued to listen.    As a senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee and Ranking Member on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Homeland Security, Terrorism, and Investigations, I take national security very seriously.  I was appointed to the Homeland Security Committee in the aftermath of the heinous, murderous, and horrific terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.  The intelligence community is part of my day to day work.    In the midst of moving toward the inauguration, stark, provocative, sobering, and difficult facts came to our attention.   All of America’s intelligence agencies confirmed the detrimental cyber-attack by high Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, to steer the election toward one candidate, Mr. Trump, and away from the other candidate.  Rather than accept their report, President-elect Trump chose to make a full force attack on the brave men and women serving in our intelligence community and disparaged their commitment to serving our nation.  There are moments in a public official’s life that you always put country over self.  That did not happen and the disappointment was piercing. As a Member of the Judiciary committee, one of my proudest moments was the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But an even prouder moment was the enormous number of votes the legislation received from both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate.  And when all the Members went to the White House for the signing of the legislation by a sitting Republican President, we celebrated America’s love affair with the precious right to vote.  President George W. Bush signed that legislation into law only to now come to 2016 to face huge examples across the nation of voter suppression in this election with newly minted laws that suppressed the voting rights of so many Americans and particularly many in minority communities.  The President-elect gave these voting abuses no credence.  Further, the President Elect has every right to select his or her cabinet. However, it is very difficult when his choice for the nation’s highest law enforcement officer, who is supposed to be the arm of justice for the most vulnerable in our nation, and that person holds consistent positions against civil rights and against voting rights.   So, I deliberated on my decision over a period of time.  I am not boycotting this ceremonial inaugural event.  I have decided in good conscience I cannot go!  John Lewis, a man who bled for freedom made his choice and made his decision without rancor or hysteria. But that was not the tone of the response he received; and John did not call for any boycott!  This is not a boycott!  This is an act of conscience! The President-elect could not refrain from a full-fledged personal attack on Congressman John Lewis.  He failed to offer even a small olive branch.   The State of the Union will be the President’s first message directly to Congress and the American people on how he will lead – that I will attend – and I am committed to working for my constituents and all of the American people.  I hope the new President will do the same!  So my principles revolving around justice and fairness, an unfettered election, the duty that I have to the national security community and the recognition of the provocative and criminal intrusion by the Russians into our election causes me to be reflective on January 20.  Finally, I did enjoy greeting my constituents as they came to the inauguration.  But as so many Americans, I will be waiting on that olive branch to be extended to all of us by this President; thereby giving us an opportunity to heal, to mend, and for him to recognize that Americans have very similar aspirations and values, and to remember that those who did not vote for the ultimate victor still deserve dignity and respect in this country!  #inauguration","status",NA,NA,131,42,29,34,1,2,0,0

Arbitrarily excluding Muslim visitors to our country will not make us safer and makes a mockery of our reputation as the world’s most welcoming nation.”   Washington, DC - Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, former Chair and Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on Transportation Security, former Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, and current Ranking Member on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s executive order banning Muslims from seven countries from entering the United States:   “As Americans we are best when we are true to the values we hold dear, beginning with fidelity to the Constitution and the laws of the United States.

As a result, when I return to Washington, I will be looking at several options including a legislative repeal, calling for a Homeland Security Committee hearing, and later options through the Appropriations process.  Congress must action immediately to bring order to this in-American process.”   “I thank the ACLU and other non-governmental organizations that went to work immediately to challenge the constitutionality of the executive order and for their success in winning a temporary stay of the order which prohibits the Trump Administration from taking action to deport the refugees and immigrants currently being detained.”   ###   Congresswoman Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District. She is a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and is Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations    Due Process In The United States Due process is a hallmark of our nation’s judicial system—this court decision assures that due process is accorded to all who have been and will be impacted by the Trump Executive Order.   The Judge’s order that stayed the Trump Executive Order said that petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection.   The Order from the court said, “There is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the Executive Order”   The Court Found that, “It is appropriate and just that, pending completion of a hearing before the Court on the merits of the Petition, that the Respondents be enjoined and restrained from the commission of further acts and misconduct in violation of the Constitution.” The Stay said that the Trump Administration is:   ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from, in any manner or by any means, removing individuals with refugee applications approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States.   Court directs service of this Order upon the United States Marshal for the Eastern District of New York, and further directs the United States Marshals Service to take those actions deemed necessary to enforce the provisions and prohibitions set forth in this Order.   Executive Order Created Unnecessary Security Risk at our Nation’s Airports   The Executive Order by President Trump unnecessarily placed a security risk on our nation’s airports as hundreds of distraught family members and persons concerned about the wellbeing of those traveling to the United Sates when to airports.    The staffing of Customs and Border Protection Agents and Transportation Security personnel were not sufficiently prepared for the consequences of the Executive Order and local law enforcement had to be called to provide assistance in what was an avoidable crisis.   On January 26, 2017, Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan announced his decision to resign in a call with senior agents Thursday morning, after he was asked to leave by the Trump Administration.   This decision by President Trump to remove the head of the agency responsible for border security just days prior to major Executive Orders that directly impacts the border, which includes airports where international flights terminate, was in excusable.   This is not an episode of the Apprentice—it is real life—with real consequences for actions.   The Executive Order that we are holding this Press Conference about sparked protest opposing it at several major airports and would have led to many other similar protest if the Judge’s stay had not gone into effect.   Protests at airports included:   Seattle Sea-Tac International Hundreds of protesters marched inside the Seattle Sea-Tac International Airport Saturday after word got out that several people were detained or sent back due to President Donald Trump’s executive order banning the entry of immigrants from seven nations.   John F. Kennedy International Airport Protests occurred at the John F Kennedy (JFK) International Airport in New York City as immigrants, including US green card holders, were detained following President Trump's executive order placing harsh restrictions on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries.   Constitution is our greatest protection against abuse of power by elected officials.   When President Trump took the oath of office he said: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""   The Constitution of the United States   We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.   ‘The office of public servant in the United States federal government requires that you take an oath to defend and protect the constitution of the United States.   ‘President Trump took that oath and he needs to keep it.   ‘The Constitution is over 200 years old, but it remains a very short document including all of its amendments.   “The Constitution should be read by every citizen and non-citizens.   “The United States is the land where the freedom to practice one’s religion without persecution, the freedom of self-determination, the freedom to build a good life for oneself and one’s family – these values are non-negotiable.   “But President Trump, and the Republicans who support him, are acting as if our shared beliefs, set forth in the Constitution, can be tossed aside.   “We are stronger when our decisions reflect our shared values of inclusion and equality. We are safer when we unite against actual threats. Demonizing people in search of a better life only increases ill-will towards us around the world. Forcing local jurisdictions by presidential mandate to assist with civil immigration enforcement will break faith with immigrant communities only to sow fear and mistrust. Militarizing the southern border and making immigration detention mandatory will only waste exorbitant amounts of taxpayer money and ensure vulnerable people continue to live in fear.   “Refugees, by definition, are those fleeing persecution – not persecutors themselves. Closing our borders to refugees fleeing devastation and war is morally indefensible. It’s cruel and it’s un-American.   ""Later this year, Congress will have an opportunity to block these discriminatory policies.  The CPC hopes that colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us using the power of the purse to stop these attacks on our fundamental values.   “This isn’t just campaign rhetoric anymore. It’s policy. And it may endanger people’s lives.”   Winning the war on Terror   ‘There are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality.   ‘The first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to Islam or to certain countries.   ‘The second way to fail is to send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as enemies; this message allows the terrorist recruiters win by saying the United States is banning Muslims, which will make us less safe and make the fight to stop ISIS much more difficult.   Statue of Liberty’s charge to all of us as right thing Americans should not be blemished by this unlawful Executive Order.   Statue of Liberty Point -- The New Colossus, by Emma Lazarus   Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land; here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the imprisoned lightning, and her name mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand lows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command, the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.   “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she with silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,   The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,   I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/photos/a.10150147207710985.331042.169479190984/10154795471440985/?type=3",NA,65,17,18,9,0,1,1,0

My USA Values Act affirms our nation’s core beliefs regarding religious freedom and equal protection and treatment under law.”     Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees today released the following statement after introducing H.R. 735, the Universal Security of American Values Act of 2017 (USA Values Act), which will invalidate the discriminatory Executive Order issued by the President banning visitors and refugees from certain countries from entering the United States simply because they exercise their right to religious liberty by adherence to the Muslim faith:     “The United States of America is a country founded by persons escaping religious persecution and freedom of worship has been a bedrock national value since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620. It is no coincidence that the first of the amendments comprising the Bill of Rights protects inviolate the free exercise of religion.     “Neither the Constitution nor the First Amendment recognizes an exception to the free exercise of religion in the case of persons of the Muslim faith. The executive order issued by the President last Friday is discriminatory Executive Order because it has the effect and intent of excluding from the United States those persons from predominately Muslim countries whose religious faith is Muslim. This is the type of invidious discrimination that our Constitution, laws, customs, and traditions do not countenance.     “That is why I have introduced H.R. 735, the Universal Security of American Values Act of 2017 (USA Values Act of 2017), which declares the Executive Order issued by the President on January 27, 2017 to be null and void and of no force and legal effect.  In addition, USA Values Act prohibits the issuance or implementation of any Executive Order that has the effect of abridging religious liberty or any of the privileges and immunities guaranteed under the Constitution or laws of the United States.     “As Americans we are best when we are true to the values we hold dear, beginning with fidelity to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The executive order, which represents the President’s attempt to make good on his pledge to impose a ban on Muslims from entering our country,  is a radical departure from the values, principles, and practices that heretofore have made America the envy of the world.     “Former president Barack Obama ‘fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith and religion.’ The former president is right, the current president is wrong and I call upon the President to rescind this discriminatory order immediately.”     “Arbitrarily excluding Muslim visitors to our country will not make us safer and makes a mockery of our reputation as the world’s most welcoming nation. The USA Values Act, which affirms the nation’s core values, complements the ‘Statute of Liberty Values Act’ (SOLVE Act), which bars ethnic and religious discrimination against refugees that was also introduced today by my colleague, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California, and sponsored by me and more than 125 Members of the House.”                                                 ###     Congresswoman Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

Mr. Escobar, who has no history of trouble with the law, is a hard-working family man whose slice of the American dream has become a nightmare because of the current Administration’s ill-conceived mass deportations”.   Since 2012, Mr. Escobar was living with his family in Houston on a deferred status, which the Congresswoman helped secure following his detention by immigration officials in late 2011.  Under the terms of his status, he was required to check-in with immigration officials annually.  And that’s what he was doing when he was detained by ICE agents on February 22, 2017.   Representatives for Escobar contacted the Congresswoman’s office, which immediately took steps to prevent his deportation.  The Congresswoman was given assurances by local ICE officials that Mr. Escobar’s deportation was on indefinite hold while efforts to reunite him with his family continued.  But despite these assurances, he was precipitously deported to El Salvador on Thursday, 3/2/2017, and sent back to a country he hasn’t seen for more than 15 years.   ”Based upon the re-interpretation of the Executive Order and immigration goals by the White House, where the focus is on criminal and gang leaders as opposed to a father with a spouse and children who are United States citizens, Mr. Escobar should not have been deported”.   “This morning, I sent a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security seeking emergency intervention and a full review and reopening of this case.    “At a time of unprecedented divisions in America and with much work needed to bring this country together, I’m strongly opposed to these sweeping deportation measures.  The new DHS implementation guidelines on deportations are tearing at the fabric of our communities, and hard-working law-abiding immigrant families like the Escobars have paid an unconscionable price, one that we cannot allow to continue.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10154887212300985/",NA,148,49,77,42,1,1,4,8

Houston’s Meals on Wheels program could see a major scale back in operations causing many seniors and other vulnerable members of the community to go without food.   On Sunday, March 19, 2017, the Congresswoman held the “Stop the Trump Budget, Save Meals on Wheels” press conference to draw attention to the devastating impact the Trump cuts could have on working families by gouging huge holes through America’s social safety net.   The Congresswoman who serves on the House Budget Committee was joined by officials from Meals on Wheels along with other local and county leaders.   Jackson Lee: “These cuts are immoral and would devastate the most vulnerable members of our community who have already suffered enough.  We must stand together to fight for American values and say “no” to the Trump budget.” These budget cuts are attacking our nation’s most vulnerable citizens at both ends of the age spectrum.  While some seniors face the prospect of going hungry, at risk youth will see the after school and summer programs they rely on slashed by $3.7 billion.  In addition, the federal work study program would be dramatically scaled back adding an extra financial burden on college students struggling to make ends meet.   The Trump budget would also eliminate the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants or SEOG.  In Texas alone, 67 thousand students received $41 million in these grants last year.   The Trump budget would strip $3 billion from the Community Development Block Grant program and take $35 million dollars in funding away from Section 4 Community Development and Affordable Housing programs.  And it slashes 500 million dollars from the WIC program, which provides food and nutrition to low-income pregnant women and lactating moms and their kids.   Jackson Lee:  “This budget shows no compassion for people at the low-end of the financial spectrum.  Instead, it takes money from those who need it the most and awards it to those who need it the least.  It runs counter to our most fundamental beliefs and principles that as Americans, we’re only as good as how we treat the most vulnerable among us.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10154939295440985/",NA,208,68,127,41,1,2,8,2

What will he do next?”  Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and a Member of the House Budget Committee released the following statement:  “New information has just been released that Trump associates may have coordinated with the Russians in the campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Today an enormous breach took place when the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee violated all protocols and maybe even the law by reporting classified information to persons who may be under active investigation.    “On Monday, March 21, FBI Director James Comey appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and testified that there was no substance and no truth to the representations of Donald Trump that President Obama had “wiretapped” Donald Trump. And today, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee may have figuratively blew up his bipartisan committee’s investigation of Trump’s accusation that he had been wiretapped by order of President Obama and undermined the credibility of the committee’s inquiry into the activities of the Russian Government to influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election and the possible collusion of Trump campaign associates in those Russian activities.   “It is clear that confidence in the government must be restored, and that an independent investigation into these matters must go forward. Whether Chairman Nunes should continue to lead that investigation, however, should be conditioned on his providing a satisfactory explanation of his conduct to the members of the Intelligence Committee and to the House of Representatives.   “The allegations under investigation by the Intelligence Committee may bear upon high crimes and misdemeanors and should be taken extremely seriously. The investigation must be factual, impartial, thorough, and unbiased.  The American people deserve the truth.” ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

The event will begin at 12:30pm, Sunday, 4/2/2017, at SonRise Community Church located at 5609 Mount Houston Road in Northeast Houston. Following remarks at the church, Pastor Edward M Buford, residents of Haverstock along with local and federal members of law enforcement will join the Congresswoman in a march to the Haverstock Hill Apartments, located at 5619 Aldine Bender Road. Should rain become an issue, the group will drive to Haverstock as opposed to marching.  One week ago, an argument erupted in gunfire that left two people dead and four others injured. Among the injured was Brandy Rusher, a former contestant on America’s Next Top Model.  The Haverstock Hill Apartments has a long history of crime problems. In 2010, law enforcement responded to more than 3,000 calls leading the county to file for its first ever gang injunction. The temporary order was made permanent four years later when a judge banned dozens of accused gang members from a “safety zone” that included Haverstock. The suspects in last Sunday’s shooting have both been apprehended but for the victims and their loved ones, justice may seem hard to find. “It’s tragic that we should even have to hold events like these,” said the Congresswoman. “But we must take a stand to protect innocent life and push back against the deadly scourge of gun violence.”  https://www.facebook.com/events/1809134689350149","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/1809134689350149/",NA,9,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Mr. Trump is the first President since Watergate to refuse to release his tax information to the public.  A full release of Trump’s tax returns will provide the public with clear information as to his potential conflicts of interest and entanglements with foreign governments and businesses.  A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 74 percent of Americans, including 53 percent of Republicans, believe Trump should release his tax returns.  Jackson Lee: “As chief steward of America’s extensive domestic, global and national security interests, the fidelity of the President of the United States to the national interest must never be subject to question or doubt.  Trump’s extensive financial interests in more than 100 companies operating in more than 18 countries and on five continents potentially represent mayor conflicts of interest between his personal financial interests and the national interests of the American people.” A preliminary analysis of Trump’s extensive financial arrangements reveals dozens of potential conflicts of interest.  For example, Trump has received more than $10 million from his interest in the Trump Towers Istanbul in Turkey, a country with which the United States has extensive, complicated and politically sensitive military and diplomatic relations.  “Since August 2015, Trump’s business organization has registered eight separate companies connected to hotel deals in Saudi Arabia, which is located in one of the world’s most critical geopolitical regions.  Based on the limited and inadequate financial disclosures he has made to date, it appears that Trump’s business organization is financially dependent upon, and obligated to Deutsche Bank, its biggest lender, which happens to be negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement over housing-crises-era abuses with the Justice Department, a deal that will be finalized with Justice Department officials appointed by Trump.  “The American people are entitled to assume without hesitation or doubt that when the President of the United States meets with foreign leaders and dignitaries that he is motivated only by what is in the national interest and not the private, pecuniary interests of himself, his family members or his business enterprises.  “As the Scriptures teach, you cannot serve two masters.  Trump must make a choice.  Either he should release his tax returns and divest all of his financial interests or relinquish the office he holds do to his inability to take care that laws be faithfully executed and to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”  ###   Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.  She is a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and is a Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations.","status",NA,NA,37,5,2,4,0,0,0,0

Members of the PSWG have been traveling to cities around the country as part of a fact-finding mission to address matters surrounding law enforcement.  Jackson Lee is delighted the group accepted her invitation to include Houston in the on-going study.   “Houston is our nation’s 3rd city and as such welcomes the opportunity to host this group of national leaders on the issue of police community relations,” said Jackson Lee.  “It is imperative that we identify strategies to strengthen relations and build trust between members of law enforcement and the people who rely on them.”   The PSWG includes Representatives Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), John Conyers (D-MI), Trey Gowdy (R-SC), Doug Collins (R-GA), Dave Reichert (R-WA), Susan Brooks (R-IN), Will Hurd (R-TX), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Cedric Richmond (D-LA), Keith Ellison (D-MN) and Robin Kelly (D-IL).

I am pleased that members of the Policing Strategies Working Group will be traveling to Houston to meet with community leaders and local law enforcement to discuss how they have addressed these challenges.”   Congressman Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, says finding ways to improve relations between police and the public is an extremely high priority.   “Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and I have been working to pursue a bipartisan strategy for both policing and criminal justice reform for the last several years,” said the Congressman Conyers.  “Despite the current political climate, it is necessary that we continue an open dialogue on building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

A healthcare promise that didn’t come to fruition.  Families now looking with his potential bill of higher healthcare costs for our working families.  24 million more Americans off of insurance.  And what about the age tax for hard working Americans age 50 to 64 paying upwards of 12 to 14 thousand dollars for their premiums?  And then the last insult to those hard working Americans who now receive Medicare: Deleting, depleting, taking away 100 million dollars from the Medicare trust fund.  There is no other answer than disapproval.  Because why would anyone who leads this nation destroy the very healthcare, the very arm of opportunity and rest that Americans have when they become sick?  I think the disapproval is probably too low.  Let us fix the healthcare system.

I will vote no to Proposition 1.”  Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and Judiciary, and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, issued the following statement about the upcoming vote on Proposition 1 demanding the Houston Independent School District and Harris County tax payers refund Texas almost $80 million:  “First I want to thank members of the Houston Independent School Board who vigorously fought state legislators, the governor and the Texas Education Agency in opposing the state’s arcane and discriminatory school funding system that unfairly hurts children in majority minority school districts.  These kids have become victims of a process that syphons valuable tax dollars from much needed programs and thus diminishing their educational opportunities.  “I believe the state of Texas funding structure for K through 12 public education is unjust.  I will vote no to Proposition 1 that forces the Houston Independent School District to return to the state almost $80 million of Harris County tax dollars that was intended for the education of our children.  “We have been through similar fights before.  Years ago I supported the lawsuit lawyers filed on behalf Texas Southern University and other historically black colleges accusing their states of discrimination with respect to funding practices.  The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division worked with me to settle the case forcing Texas to fund TSU.  The order is still active and was cited in 2016 and 2017 when Texas was found to be in noncompliance.  “I believe that the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education’s Civil Rights Divisions need to challenge the State of Texas on its broken school funding process and the TEA’s intimidating order against HISD.  “Finally, I look forward to working with the community and school board members who fought valiantly against this attack on our children’s education.  I thank them for their efforts.  As a member of the United States Congress, I intend to seek relief under Federal Civil rights laws to protect our children from this blatant and reckless discriminatory funding process which undermines the opportunities for innocent children.    ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

He was born and raised in Athens, Alabama and has worked on air in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Michigan. The 31-year-old is the newest face of KTRK- ABC13 Anchor Team. Chauncy was bitten by the News Bug quite early. In fact, his father built him his very own ""anchor news desk"" at the age of 6! That's where Chauncy ""anchored"" his news shows every Sunday evening after church for his family and friends. It may have been all fun and games for Chauncy's ""viewers"" at the time, but he was serious about television news. He later turned his hobby into a career. He went on to study Broadcast Journalism, Music and Theatre at Troy University. He also has a degree in Public Relations. He graduated at the top of his college class and was awarded the Sydney Sullivan Top Senior Award, which is an honor given for academic excellence, forwardness in faith and campus and community involvement. Chauncy started his TV career two days after graduating college, landing his first reporter job at WTVM News Leader 9 in Columbus, Georgia. After a two-year stint there, Chauncy packed up and headed for the Sunshine State. Chauncy joined Action News CBS 47 and Fox 30 in Jacksonville, Florida. There he was a special projects and General Assignment reporter. Chauncy left Florida’s sunny beaches to brave Michigan’s snowy winters in December 2011.He joined the Local 4 News team in Detroit Michigan as a Reporter/Fill-in anchor. He reported for one of the top-rated shows in the country--Local 4 News at 11. From local news to national news, Chauncy has covered the big stories. While at Local 4, he covered the Sandy Hook Massacre in Newtown where he landed an exclusive interview with the teacher who was in the classroom next to the one where the massacre took place. Chauncy also reported live from Cleveland as three women held in captivity for ten years were freed. But there’s one story that Chauncy covered in Detroit that he says he’ll never forget. He was sent on breaking news to a school where two students had been shot by a coach after they tried to rob him. One suspect was found wounded and rushed to the hospital, but the second one was nowhere in sight until Chauncy stumbled upon the young man lying in the street. He had been shot in the chest and was clinging to life. Chauncy tried to help but it was too late.  After witnessing the teenager die on the streets of Detroit, he went back to Martin Luther King Jr. Sr. High School and created a mentorship program for young men. “The Chauncy Glover Project” is a hands-on, extensive mentoring program that grooms teenage boys into upstanding gentlemen. The program focuses on dressing for success, manhood, etiquette, college readiness, tutoring, public speaking community service and more. While anticipating the 501c3 status, Chauncy funded the program himself. The CGP mission is, “To empower, encourage and inspire young men to become strong, moral and confident leaders of society.” CGP is proud to say it has sent more than four dozen young men to college with scholarships and the program has expanded to Houston--where CGP is mentoring 30 young men.  Chauncy has won several awards for his work, being recognized by the Associated Press, National Association of Black Journalist’s Angelo B. Henderson Community Service Award, MTM Unsung Heroes and many more. In 2013, Chauncy won his first Emmy for Best On-Camera Talent- Live Reporter. In 2014 he was nominated for three Emmy’s, in the Best Spot News, Best Continuing Coverage and Best Reporter Live categories, in which he brought home two Emmy’s, for Best Spot News and the other Best On Camera Talent-Live Reporter. He was inducted into the prestigious (MOE) Men of Excellence in the fall of 2014. Chauncy was also named one of the Ambassadors of The Year for his work with the youth of Detroit. He was among Madonna, Mary Barra and five others to receive this coveted honor. As a professional TV Host and actor, Chauncy has traveled the world in productions, but his proudest moment was being asked to honor the late civil rights activist Rosa Parks, by singing at her funeral in Montgomery, Alabama. A sought after motivational speaker, Chauncy spends a lot of time traveling and delivering riveting speeches across the country. But he always finds the time to serve. Chauncy serves in the National Association of Black Journalist, National Broadcasting Society, Abstinence In Motion, Men of Standard, The Arts Council, Troy University Alumni Association and the National Reading Alliance. He's also a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. Chauncy lives by the three F’s---Faith, Family, and Fitness. His life motto is “Fear stops where Faith begins.”  Join me in celebrating one of Houston's most dapper, and dedicated, and devoted men Mr. Chauncy Glover.

Will we uphold the rule of law or allow for the continued obstruction of justice by a Chief Executive who brazenly abuses his power?  “Americans need to know the truth about Russia’s interference in our election and the collusion of Russian agents and Trump campaign officials.  But following the President’s abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey and revelations Trump pressured Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, it is abundantly clear that an outside independent prosecutor is required to find the facts.  “That is why I have introduced the ‘Trump Special Counsel Act’ (H.R.2444), which modifies and codifies DOJ regulations providing for the appointment of a Special Counsel that have been in place since 1999 when the Independent Counsel Act expired and was not reauthorized.    “The ‘Trump Special Counsel Act’ specifically includes among the “extraordinary circumstances” triggering the appointment of a Special Counsel any criminal investigation involving the following: • the President, Vice President, their spouses or children; • any organization, enterprise, or entity owned by, under the control of, or serving the interests of the of the President or Vice President; or • which involves the activities of agents or entities under the control of or allied with a foreign state activing in concert with agents, organizations or entities associated with the President of the Vice President. “It is my firm belief that only through a Special Counsel will the American people be able to trust the outcome of such a critically important investigation.”  ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

A day after I formally introduced the ‘Trump Special Counsel Act’ (H.R. #2444) which provides for the immediate appointment of a Special Counsel, I am pleased that the Department of Justice has moved rapidly to appoint as Special Counsel former FBI Director Robert Mueller.  Mr. Mueller is a respected law enforcement official and I hope he will begin his work swiftly.However, it is important to note that the work of a Special Counsel does not necessarily move with dispatch.  The Special Counsel should be direct and thorough and their work can last for years, such as with the Iran-Contra investigation that stretched from 1986 to 1993. Therefore, I still think it’s important that the Judiciary Committees in the House and Senate continue their investigations and follow the facts, which may lead to an impeachment inquiry.  The appointment of a Special Counsel should not stop the work of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on behalf of the American people.”","status",NA,NA,42,26,2,5,4,0,0,1

As hijacked aircraft began their heinous and unthinkable assault, air traffic controllers had little time to act. “At stake were the lives of the nearly 1 million passengers on more than 5 thousand planes that were either over or fast-approaching North America on that September 11th morning.  After United flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, the FAA declared that all planes be grounded, an order that had never been implemented before.  And yet, through improvisation and seasoned professionalism, controllers managed to safely land all 5 thousand flights.  They were heroes one and all and yet to this day, most of their names remain anonymous.  That’s just what they do.  “Air traffic controllers are essential to commercial aviation security and to the security of Americans.  The proposal just announced by the Trump Administration to privatize the air traffic control system raises serious questions regarding security at our nation’s airports. This proposal needs to be thoroughly vetted by all relevant Congressional committees including the Homeland Security Committees of both the House and Senate. “Today, I join representatives from TWU, AFSCME, IBEW 716, Paul Puente of the Gulf Coast Building and Construction Trades council, and with the President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association who has said the status quo is unacceptable but has vowed to oppose any reform proposal that would institute a for-profit model.  He has also laid out the following conditions that any reform proposal must meet:   protect the rights and benefits of the workforce ensure that (security) and efficiency remain a top priority provide a stable, predictable funding stream that adequately supports air traffic control services, staffing, hiring and training, long-term modernization, preventative maintenance, and ongoing modernization of the physical infrastructure maintain service to all segments of our nation’s diverse aviation community.   “Today, I remain concerned that privatization would lead to mass firings and the degradation of the work conditions crucial for maintaining the viability of the air traffic control system.  “Air traffic controllers have begun to use next generation technology.  Since 2007, Congress has provided approximately $7 billion for NextGen with the goal of full implementation by 2030. Any private company that assumes control and management of the system should surpass the technology controllers currently have in place.  “Legislative efforts to privatize air traffic control may require the FAA to giveaway traffic control facilities and equipment necessary to conduct air traffic control system. This was the approach of Shuster’s Bill last Congress. Neither the federal government nor any auditing authority has assessed the value of what they may plan to give to the entity that might be assigned management of air traffic control. “The Department of Defense and the FAA collaborate in many ways to assure a seamless system of air defense and civilian air travel security.  Following September 11, 2001 this coordination has been a mainstay in assuring another attack does not happen.  There is no experience for the DoD to follow should it be required to coordinate with a private entity in the way has done with federal agencies for domestic defense. “Congress has authority to delegate authority or power to a federal government agency or private entity, but it is not clear whether the Constitution allows Congress to delegate power to a for-profit or non-profit entity.  The proposal that the administration now offers is that of a failed attempt by Republicans to move such a plan through congress. “Last Congress, Chairman Shuster introduced a FAA reauthorization bill that would have privatized the Air Traffic Control system. During committee consideration of the bill all Democrats and two Republicans opposed it.  Although the bill made it out of committee it did not advance to the floor due to strong bipartisan opposition.  The bill was never voted on. “A historic change of this magnitude impacting the defense and security of our nation has to be bipartisan. “The FAA provides service to over 15.5 million aircraft each year. The total number of aircraft managed by all other nations is 12 million combined. The security of our nation is too crucial than to take a chance on privatization at a time of rising terrorism. “I fear the ultimate goal of the President’s plan is to issue a big check to one of his corporate friends. “We cannot allow that to happen.  The security of Americans is at stake.  And the 15 thousand dedicated men and women who manage more than 87 thousand flights daily across the U.S., deserve more.  Air traffic controllers weren’t just heroes of 911.  They serve heroically every day.” “Today, I stand for national security and for the security and expertise of the men and women who serve as FAA air traffic controllers.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10155187208655985/",NA,77,13,35,9,1,0,0,3

What I witnessed this morning were alarming revelations that a sitting President attempted to bully a public servant with the intent of dissuading him from performing his official duties.  “Mr. Comey testified that the President ordered him to stop the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn.  Comey also testified that he felt compelled to write memos detailing his conversations with Trump because he had serious doubts that the President could be expected to tell the truth.   “The House Judiciary Committee on-which I serve is the appropriate jurisdictional committee over matters relating to the administration of justice.  I call again for my Republican colleagues to initiate a formal inquiry into any allegations of misconduct by the Trump Administration.   “Constitutional experts have said a Special Counsel does not preclude the role that Congress should play in ensuring the Executive Branch does not overstep its authority.  Given the gravity of today’s testimony, there should be a bipartisan call for the Congressional investigations to continue and a commitment to follow the evidence wherever it leads.  ###   Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

The Congresswoman’s press conference comes amidst an alarming uptick in hate-motivated violence aimed at Muslims and those who would attempt to protect them.  Last month’s fatal stabbings of Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Rick Best left two families heartbroken and devastated.     Meche, a recent college graduate and Best, a veteran of the United States Army, were stabbed to death after they intervened when a man yelled hate speech toward two women including one of Muslim descent on a Portland, Oregon commuter train.  Micah Fletcher, a third man who attempted to help, was seriously injured.  Hate speech from racist groups like ‘Act for America’ and fear-stoking rhetoric from the White House may have fueled some of these heinous acts.  In 2016, the Human Rights Watched reported that hate crimes against Muslims rose dramatically in the U.S., just as they had the year before.  And according to the Council on American Islamic Relations, there have been 35 attacks against Mosques across the Nation so far this year.     “Today, I call on the Trump Administration to immediately cease and desist from stoking and playing on the fears of Americans,” said Jackson Lee.  “His proposed Muslim Ban creates hostility and danger to law abiding persons of different faiths.  It is beyond time that the President drop this proposal and abandon the anti-Muslim rhetoric promoting violence across this nation.     Muslims are an integral part of the fabric of America.  During this, the holy month of Ramadan, we are reminded of their many achievements and accomplishments that have strengthened the corps of our democracy.     “Although the President’s words and policies highlight our differences in a negative way, people should never lose sight that these vary differences are what make America and Americans so uniquely special,” added Jackson Lee. “In the spirit of the sacred Latin text that has been etched on our founding documents, “E Pluribus Unum,” Out of many one.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10155203574940985/",NA,130,42,52,30,0,0,0,4

The Congresswoman, who was joined by medical professionals, issued the following statement about the Senate’s mean-spirited Bill.     “Senate Trumpcare is a heartless and immoral attempt to deny basic health services to hard working families.  This bill would result in many people—especially low income and older Americans—paying thousands more in premiums for skimpier health plans. This so-called health care bill is nothing more than a huge tax cut for the wealthiest few, paid for by billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, which serves one in five Americans—including two-thirds of seniors in nursing homes—and cuts to Planned Parenthood.  Trumpcare still means higher costs for less care for millions of Americans.   Below are seven of the worst things in the Senate’s version of Trumcare:   1.     Kicks millions off of Medicaid – more “mean” than the House bill.   2.     Decimates the tax credit for those in the individual market.   3.     Abandons people with pre-existing conditions, especially maternity care and mental health.   4.     Defunds Planned Parenthood, eliminating care for women across the country.   5.     Gives the wealthiest Americans a massive tax break on day one.   6.     Eliminates health care coverage for those with opioid, substance use, and mental health disorders.   7.     Forces older Americans to pay more for coverage, strips seniors of critical services.   “After seeing the House Republicans craft a bill that would kick 14 million enrollees off Medicaid due to funding cuts of $834 billion, Senate Republicans doubled down and opted for even steeper cuts in their bill.   “In 3 years, the Senate bill will start the process of kicking millions off their Medicaid coverage. And then as if that wasn't enough, starting in 2025 the plan will institute even more Medicaid cuts that every year become a deeper cut than the year before. Within 10 years of this new funding system, the cuts to Medicaid could total hundreds of billions of dollars.   “Medicaid provides coverage for 74 million Americans – about 1 in 5 people. Nearly half of Medicaid enrollees are children, and almost half of births in the country are paid for by Medicaid. One-quarter of Medicaid enrollees are seniors and those with disabilities, many of which receive their nursing and home-based care through Medicaid.   The Republican plan to repeal the Medicaid expansion and cap Medicaid will make the opioid crisis worse. Millions will be at risk of losing coverage for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery services. These are the people who will be DEVASTATED by these cuts.   “The Republican bill significantly reduces the availability of tax credits to working-class American families. The ACA pegs the value of the tax credit to a silver-level plan with an actuarial value of 70 percent. The Republican Senate bill instead uses a plan with a 58 percent actuarial value as its benchmark.  These changes could result in Americans on the individual exchange paying thousands more a year for worse health coverage than they currently receive under the ACA.   “Despite Republican claims that the bill takes care of people for pre-existing conditions, the Senate bill still fails to provide protections for people with pre-existing conditions by sneaking through a back-door provision to charging people with pre-existing conditions dramatically more for their coverage.   “The bill eliminates federal funding for Planned Parenthood, resulting in both men and women losing access to the affordable, high-quality care that they rely on. Planned Parenthood serves 2.5 million women and families nationwide in every state and the District of Columbia.  This disproportionately Affects people who already face structural barriers to accessing care since 54% percent of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in health professional shortage areas, rural or medically underserved areas.   “This mean Republican bill includes an age tax that allows insurers to charge older adults five times as much as younger people, resulting in thousands of dollars in monthly premium increases for those in their early sixties.  The spike in costs could potentially put coverage out of reach for millions of older Americans.   “The Senate Trumpcare bill keeps the House provisions that provide a massive tax cut exclusively to the wealthiest Americans, while gutting Medicaid – the program for the most vulnerable Americans – in order to pay for it. The Senate bill repeals the 3.8 percent tax on capital gains, dividends and interest income, as well as a 0.9 percent Medicare surtax. Both taxes apply only to individuals earning more than $200,000 per year or families earning more than $250,000 per year. Together, the two tax breaks are worth $231 billion over the next ten years.   “Of the tax on capital gains, 90 percent of the tax break would go to the top one percent of earners – those earning $700,000 or more per year, good for an average tax break of $25,000. The top 0.1 percent of earners would get an average tax cut of $165,000.   TRUMPCARE HURTS TEXANS In Texas as with most of America, the impact of Senate Trumpcare would be devastating:   ·        1.9 million individuals in the state who have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented could lose their coverage.  ·        1.09 million individuals in the state who purchased high quality Marketplace coverage now stand to lose their coverage due to Senate Trumpcare.  ·         913,177 individuals in the state who received financial assistance to purchase Marketplace coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per individual, are at risk of having coverage become unaffordable through the Republican plan.  ·         1.1 million individuals in the state could have insurance if Texas adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expansion and if Trumpcare did not eliminate Medicaid expansion.  ·         508,000 kids who have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented are also at risk of having their coverage rolled back.    “Now is the time to make your voice heard.  Call your Senator.  Tell them why we can’t afford to go back to a time when many Americans first saw their doctor in a hospital emergency room.    “Join the fight.  Call 202-224-3121 and ask to speak to your Senator.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10155241988970985/",NA,92,36,98,15,1,4,3,6

It is a healthcare bill that gives massive tax breaks to drug companies, insurance companies, and the wealthy at the expense of low and middle-income families.  This Senate Bill is opposed by the AARP, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Cancer Society, among others","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/462624117429675/",NA,66,12,0,9,1,0,0,0

TRUMP JR. WITH RUSSIAN ATTORNEY  Jackson Lee: “How many more undisclosed interactions with Russian citizens, the Trump campaign and former Trump Administration officials will have to occur before the House Judiciary Committee opens an impeachment inquiry?”   WASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations released the following statement  calling for the House Judiciary Committee to launch hearings into the activities of President Trump, whose Presidential campaign remains the focus of investigations surrounding Russia’s collusion and interference into the United States’ 2016 presidential election:  “How many more undisclosed interactions with Russian citizens, the Trump campaign and former Trump Administration officials will have to occur before the House Judiciary Committee opens an impeachment inquiry?  What will trigger the House Republicans to fulfill their constitutional duty to provide oversight of this President?  “No policies of substance are being accomplished for the American people.  No legislative initiatives are making their way through the legislative process.  If their only purpose is to maintain power and reverse decades of Supreme Court precedent, then shame on House Republicans.  “I raise the following concerns:  1. Misrepresentation regarding the number and purpose of meetings with Russians and Trump campaign officials; 2. The most recently disclosed meeting, first alleged to be about adoption only to later learn it was about lifting sanctions on Russian human rights violators; 3. Failure of Jared Kushner to fully disclose his meetings with Russians on the security clearance application form SF-86; 4. Trump’s attempts to discredit the intelligence community’s conclusion that the Russians interfered in the election causing Trump to win and Hillary Clinton to lose; and 5. The real purpose of the Trump meeting with the Russian lawyer was to obtain damaging opposition information to harm Hillary Clinton; this conduct goes far beyond ordinary campaign tactics but instead  indicates collusion with a foreign national of a hostile nation.  “Conclusively, inaction by the House Judiciary Committee to investigate leaves a huge missing component to restoring constitutional order and informing the American public truthfully about all of these actions.”  ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

According to forecasts, over the next two weeks Houston’s scorching temperatures will average in the mid to upper 90’s. Next Monday and Tuesday for instance, the forecast calls for highs of 98 degrees, followed by 95 degrees on Wednesday.   It is particularly life-threatening to be in homes without any form of air conditioning because those homes become extremely heated to the point of near suffocation in some instances.  Just last August, a husband and wife in their 60s died from heat expositor in their North Houston home because of no air conditioning.    For more than 20 years, the Congresswoman has worked closely with local non-profit organizations to distribute and install air conditioners for those who are most at risk.  “This helps to ensure that our residents remain cool during our sweltering summers,” added Jackson Lee.   Children typically spend the most time out in the sun without replenishing their fluids, and doctors say that they, and the elderly, run the greatest risk of developing mild heat illness.  Prolonged failure to treat mild heat illness can lead to more serious conditions like heat exhaustion or even death by heat stroke.  For the elderly, factors such as fragile health combined with an extremely high heat index contribute to the rising number of fatalities.  However, socioeconomic problems such as poverty, isolation, and substandard housing in communities with high crime and low business or social centers have a tremendous impact.  Experts say as the weather gets hotter, it becomes more difficult for the human body to shed heat. Normally, heat flows from the human body into the atmosphere, but when temperatures rise above 100 degrees, the body’s natural cooling system reverses, and heat flows from environment into the body. At this point, another cooling mechanism usually kicks in: sweating. But in hot, humid places, like Houston, sweat does not readily evaporate, preventing the human body from dissipating heat and cooling down.  Texas averages 68 heat-related deaths per year.

Never before in history has a President of the United States, the nation that led the alliance that defeated Nazism and fascism in the greatest conflict in world history, ever publicly defended or tried to normalize neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, or White Supremacists. That long and unbroken precedent ended today with the President’s obscene and shameful attempt to draw a moral equivalence between the neo-Nazis and bigots who descended upon the quiet, peaceful town of Charlottesville with their hateful ideology on the one hand, and anti-racist protestors on the other.   ""One group advocated hate, division, and racial superiority; the other affirmed racial unity and the equality of all persons ordained by the Creator. One group idolizes the most evil war criminal in human history; the other shares and is committed to making real the dream of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. One group was animated by the forces of darkness and hate; the other inspired by the light of reason and love. The difference between these two opposing ideas and ideals is so clear, so stark and vivid, that it could only go unrecognized by the morally blind, which Donald Trump has revealed himself to be.  “At Gettysburg, President Lincoln said ‘the world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it will never forget what they did here.’ Nor will we ever forget what happened in Charlottesville, the home of my law school alma mater, on Saturday, August 12, 2017. And we will always remember Heather Heyer, a true patriot who was murdered standing up for what is right by a domestic terrorist who rejects the American way of life.   My thoughts and prayers are also with the families and loved ones of all of those injured by that act of domestic terrorism and those of Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates of the Virginia State Police who were assisting public safety efforts when their helicopter crashed, killing them both. I especially wish a full and speedy recovery to Natalie Romero who was seriously injured in the crash that took Ms. Heyer’s life. Ms. Romero is an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia and a graduate of Bellaire High School (the same high school attended by son and daughter).  “Our magnificent Constitution guarantees and protects the right of neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalists, and other like-minded groups to peaceably assemble and advocate their white supremacy and separatist beliefs. But that same Constitution provides an equal right to those who wish to protest their hateful ideology. That the Constitution protects the right to demonstrate in both cases does not mean that the causes espoused by both groups are equally meritorious. As every president from Franklin Roosevelt through Barack Obama clearly understood and affirmed, they are not. Civil action in support of equality and justice is worthy of commendation. Civil action in support of a white supremacist ideology is worthy only of condemnation. If the President cannot recognize this difference, it is time for a different president.”","status",NA,NA,81,47,16,14,2,0,0,0

Many of them are still waiting for home inspections and need answers regarding the appeals process and how best to utilize Home Inspection Teams.   “I am calling on FEMA to create a new app to provide homeowners with instant status updates on the inspection process,” said Congresswoman Jackson Lee.  “This app should speed up the process of scheduling FEMA inspectors for a home visit if your home has not been inspected in more than 10 days. This will help the many who are struggling to get their lives back in order.” This week, FEMA announced the creation of a new housing program under the Direct Housing Assistance Program, which allows FEMA disaster relief funding to go to individual homeowners or to local governments to provide housing.  To be considered for this program, people must first register with FEMA at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. Local government immediate disaster assistance housing options are as follows: Multi-Family Lease and Repair: • Direct assistance to repair or improve existing multi-family housing such as apartments in order to provide more housing for survivors. • Properties must be three or more units, with each unit providing complete living facilities for cooking, eating, and sanitation. Hotels, motels, and extended stay hotels are not eligible at this time. Direct Leasing: • Direct Leasing: Enables local governments to lease a property that typically would not be available to the public, such as corporate lodging. • Local government enters into the lease agreement on behalf of individuals or households. Various types of housing properties may be eligible. Manufactured Housing Options (Mobile Homes and Recreational Vehicles): • Direct housing places manufactured housing units on private land or commercial pads. • Local permitting may apply. • Site must be suitable. Hauling and installation included. • An inspection of the site to determine suitability will be scheduled. Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS): • PREPS provides minor repairs to homes in locations with limited housing options. • For eligible properties that have incurred limited damage displacing individuals from their homes. • PREPS provides basic, emergency home repairs - not to include finish work. Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair: • Program provides partial repairs to homes with significant damages. • Program can include partial repairs to a damaged home where alternative housing is not available or is not cost-effective. • FEMA will determine eligibility for permanent housing construction on a case-by-case basis. • All other forms of housing assistance must be exhausted before the program can be considered. Some Hurricane Harvey survivors are getting an extension to stay temporarily in hotels while they look for an alternative place to live.  October 14 is the new checkout date for the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program, which pays for short-term hotel stays.  All applicants for FEMA recovery assistance have the right to appeal if they are dissatisfied with FEMA’s determination letter. All appeals must be in writing and explain the reasons why FEMA’s decision may not be correct. The appeal should include any documentation that FEMA requests or that supports your claim. Appeals can be submitted via computer by opening a Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) account at www.disasterassistance.gov.

A Prayer Vigil For Reflection And a Cry For Immediate Passage of Gun Violence Prevention Legislation   Jackson Lee: “After the deaths of so many in Sandy Hook, Charleston, Tucson, Orlando and now Las Vegas, we cannot be silent and must stand up against the gun violence that claims the lives of more than 30 thousand Americans every year.”   Houston, TX – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Co-Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Taskforce, joined with mothers touched by gun violence to demand the immediate passage of gun safety legislation.     On October 1st, 2017, the world witnessed America’s worst mass shooting in its history when Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowed attending a country music concert in Las Vegas.  The resulting gunfire left 58 innocent people dead and more than 500 wounded.     Authorities said the domestic terrorist responsible for the massacre owned 47 guns, 23 of which were found in his Las Vegas hotel room.  12 of them were equipped with a dangerous gun accessory called Bump Stocks, transforming his semi-automatic firearms into veritable machineguns.   Alarmingly, all of his guns were legal, and legally acquired.   “Too many families are reeling from the unthinkable loss of loved ones who were at the wrong end of a gun,” said Congresswoman Jackson Lee.  “To do nothing in the face of this unending cycle of gun violence is simply not an option.  Congress must do its job.”   Reasonable sportsmen and hunters have no use for this type of firepower which is designed to kill.  That is why I wrote a letter urging the President to prohibit the sale of this accessory, and why soon I will introduce legislation to ban bump stocks.   We must also oppose H.R. 3668, the so-called Hearing Protection Act, which makes our streets more prone to violence by deregulating gun silencers and placing them into the hands of the very people wreaking havoc in communities across the nation.  Last week, I joined with my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee in a successful effort to prevent the House from voting on this irresponsible legislation.   Other measures we should take to protect American lives include the following:   • Require universal background checks to keep guns out of dangerous hands;   • Ban military-style assault weapons;   • Limit high-capacity magazines;   • Increase access to mental health services;   • Pass legislation aimed specifically at cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and straw-purchases;   • Vote yes to H.R. 3613, the Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act, which provides federal funding for gun buyback programs;   • And restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. While it is certainly true that violent crime and homicide rates in this country have been declining in recent years, they are still far above those in other industrialized nations.  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.   Far too often, these violent acts involve high-power military-style assault weapons.  Many of them are in the wrong hands, and end up being the highly effective and highly lethal tools of criminals and mass murderers.   “We must protect our citizens without infringing on the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans,” said Congresswoman Jackson Lee.  We are a can-do people who do not bemoan our problems and accept terrible outcomes.  When it comes to reducing or preventing gun violence, we must summon our American resolve and know-how and get the job done.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10155563082005985/",NA,167,63,109,30,3,2,1,4

Earlier this month just after the #DSNAP program in Houston ended, I immediately sent a letter urging the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to work with me to give struggling Hurricane Harvey survivors more time to obtain the food assistance they so desperately need.   I knew that with all the long lines at Disaster Recovery Centers throughout my district and elsewhere, people were suffering. “Fortunately, the USDA was very accommodating and agreed to resume operations of the program for an additional three days.  However, the Harris County took longer than I feel is reasonable in a disaster to identify the requisite sites.  That is why I am pleased to announce that authorities are now setting up a site at Alexander Deussen Park, located at 12303 Sonia Road.  We expect the location to be up and running as soon as possible.  In the meantime, I will continue my work to secure more sites because people are hurting.   Houston is still confronting disaster with businesses closed and people out of work.  While we fight for funding in Washington, it is imperative that all branches of government collaborate to get people the help they need.

BBQ Masters for Disaster arrived in Houston days after Hurricane Harvey carved its path of destruction through the Bayou City.  Guiding their barbecue rig through flooded streets, the volunteers immediately set up shop in Northeast Houston, one of the areas hardest hit by the catastrophic storm.   Low income neighborhoods like Greespoint were decimated by the perilous flood waters, which destroyed several apartment complexes and tens of thousands of vehicles.  As a result, many people lost their jobs, their livelihoods, and their ability to feed themselves and their families.   “Thanks to BBQ Masters for Disaster, they did not have to search long for a warm meal,” said Congresswoman Jackson Lee.  “By working with my office and the Red Cross, the volunteers, led by Gene and Shaun Martin, along with A. Toor and David Montoya, managed to feed the hungry.  “From September 7, 2017 until today, their 38-foot barbecue rig has prepared an average of 5 thousand meals a day, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner to storm-weary residents in need.  The sound of a sizzling grill and mouth-watering smells became a fixture in the 6200 block of Tidwell, and offered a welcome reprieve to a community reeling from Mother Nature’s wrath.   “Today, after five weeks of providing nourishment to people struggling to rebuild their lives, BBQ Masters for Disaster is moving on.  But they leave behind the warm hearts and full bellies of a gracious community, filled with gratitude to those who answered the call and provided food when it was needed most.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanSheilaJacksonLee/videos/10155578328890985/",NA,198,60,81,52,2,0,1,1

Thanks to the cooperation between the Federal Government and State, in spite of the obstacles with site selection.  And I thank METRO for providing shuttles to transport storm-impacted Houstonians to and from the Deussen Park Site.  Together, they made it work and as a result, thousands were served on Wednesday, October 18, 2017.”  Houston, TX – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a Senior Member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, issued the following statement about the enormous need and response to the Disaster Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or D-SNAP:  “I am saddened that an elderly gentlemen who traveled to Alexander Deussen Park seeking the aid that he deserved lost his life.  My deepest sympathies and prayers go out to his family.  “At the start of the three day extension for D-SNAP in Harris County, I witnessed firsthand the plight of Hurricane Harvey survivors who were forced to endure extreme hardships to secure the benefits they so desperately need.   These were men and women, including seniors and the disabled, who are hurting and struggling to get back on their feet.  “Many of them suffer from one or more of the following hardships:  • Lost or no access to income; • Home or business repairs; • Temporary shelter or evacuation expenses; • Home or business protection expenses; • Cost to replace personal or household items; • Clean-up expenses; • And personal injury, including funeral expenses.  “With these added expenses, food support is very important.  That is why they came to the emergency D-SNAP processing site at Alexander Deussen Park, to submit applications for food assistance.    “The site, which is located 22 miles northeast of downtown, has only one lane leading in and one lane leading out.  As a result, far too many storm-weary survivors were forced to wait in a long line of traffic for up to three hours.  This inconvenience could have been avoided had the County Judge abided by repeated requests to designate additional processing sites.  “Under law, site selection was solely in the hands of the county judge, and he made the decision on his own.  Additional sites submitted for consideration by the City and the Commissioner of Harris County Precinct 1 appear to have been ignored.   “Fortunately, however, many residents braved the crowds and made it in to Deussen Park.  Then, under the threat of criminal penalty for the penalty of law for providing misleading information, they filled out the appropriate paperwork and received the help they needed.  Those individuals who were not eligible did not receive the benefits.  In all, the state processed thousands of people on Wednesday.     “The D-SNAP benefit pays for up to two months of groceries and to prevent fraud, can only be secured in person.  Specifically, the State checks the zip codes which are tied to storm-impacted areas.  Additional sites might have made this process easier but the Federal and State Governments are doing their job. I applaud them.   “When the D-SNAP program ended earlier this month, I immediately sent a letter urging the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to work with me to give struggling Hurricane Harvey survivors more time to obtain this vital nutritional support.  Fortunately, the USDA was very accommodating and agreed to resume operations of the program for an additional three days.    “The lives of the people standing in line should not be disrespected or taken for granted.  D-SNAP should not be incorrectly characterized as a “giveaway program,” but rather for what it is; a disaster food program implemented in response to the extreme and catastrophic devastation caused by a thousand year storm.  “The federal government still believes the disaster in impacted areas is so grave that it is extending the time period for FEMA disaster registration to November 24, 2017.  Federal and state officials understand the extent to which people continue to suffer.  It is unfortunate that this understanding has not prevailed within all levels of government.  “Despite the difficulties, Alexander Deussen Park will continue to process applications for people who require food assistance until Friday, October 20, 2017.","status",NA,NA,39,8,2,9,0,0,0,0

Never should they be called ‘inmates running the prison’.”  Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, issued the following statement about the talks between the NFL, owners and players surrounding the on-going protests by NFL players and the offensive remarks by the owner of the Texans:  “The culture of the NFL has to change.  The uproar over Americans who simply want to petition their government for grievances was unnecessary and insensitive.  Colin Kaepernick had a right to take a knee to protest the state of police/community relations.  The young men who have joined him have a right to express their views.  “I have and will continue to stand by them.  Out of the rancor and discord surrounding these protests should come massive investment in the African American community and reforms to the criminal justice system.  The NFL players across the league are fine young people, many of whom college graduates, who every day go to work and put forward their best effort.  Never should they be called “inmates running the prison,” as they were referred to by the owner of the Texans.  “I join the community in demanding answers and solutions now!”  A Community Meeting will be held at Community of Faith Church tonight at 7pm.  Congresswoman Jackson Lee will join via conference call from Washington, D.C.","status",NA,NA,20,9,5,6,1,0,0,0

The debt that we owe to them is immeasurable.  Their sacrifices and those of their families are freedom’s foundation.  Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guardsmen and their families, our country would not live so freely.   “On this Veterans Day, we remember the patriotic sacrifices of those who have served, during a period of conflict or in peace time, at home or overseas to uphold the ideals upon which the United States was built.  Now, more than ever, we must renew our commitment to keep our promises to the nation’s  more than 2 million troops and reservists, their families, and over 21 million veterans, including over  26,000 here in 18th Congressional District.   “Let us also honor the memory of the more than 4,400 American servicemen and women who have died in Iraq and more than 2,300 who have died in Afghanistan, and the brave warriors killed in Niger and elsewhere.   We also honor the sacrifices of the nearly 50,000 troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.   “Veterans Day is a time to honor and remember the millions of veterans in this generation and generations past who have made countless sacrifices in service of our country.  Our nation owes them a tremendous debt of gratitude.”    ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

DR. SALATHEIA BRYANT-HONORS  Jackson Lee: “Salatheia Bryant-Honors loved her husband and two children, and her passing at the young age of 52 leaves us all with a void far too large to fill.  I offer her family my deepest prayers and condolences.”  Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, released the following statement about the passing of community treasure Rev. Dr. Salatheia Bryant-Honors:  “Rarely is one so gifted and equipped as to attain enormous success in two entirely distinct fields of service to their fellow men and women.  Rarely does one possess the aptitude and passion necessary to be an award-winning journalist before ascending to the pulpit.  Rev. Dr. Salatheia Bryant-Honors was one such anointed and unique individual.  “Salatheia Bryant-Honors was an extraordinary journalist who was respected by her peers and who excelled at her craft.  She worked hard to report the news and inform and empower her community, traits she lovingly applied as spiritual leader to her faithful God-fearing flock at Reedy Chapel in Galveston, the state's oldest A.M.E. Church.  “I knew Rev. Dr. Bryant-Honors as both a journalist and pastor.  She was my soror, my AKA sister who regardless of the challenge, always wore a bright smile.  Rev. Dr. Bryant-Honors was part of the esteemed A.M.E. clergy family that always strives to serve others.  “The successful effort she led to restore Reedy Chapel after Hurricane Ike stands as testament to her grit, resolve, and active faith.  The facility’s rebirth was nothing short of a miracle.  “I considered Rev. Dr. Bryant-Honors to be a dear friend as did everyone graced by her presence, but her family knew her best.  Rev. Dr. Bryant-Honors loved her husband of 27 years, Rev. Reginald Honors, and the couple’s two children: Bryant ""BJ"" Honors and Kennedy Honors.  The passing of Rev. Bryant-Honors at the young age of 52 leaves us all with a void far too large to fill.  I offer her family my deepest prayers and condolences.   “Her homegoing service was presided over by Elder Brenda Payne, and she was eulogized by Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, the 117th elected and consecrated bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. I was privileged to speak at the viewing service, where I likened Rev. Dr. Bryant-Honors to two women in the Bible, Ruth and Esther, who were strong in their faith, full of resolve, and committed to helping others no matter what obstacles they had to face.  Like Ruth and Esther, Rev. Dr. Bryant-Honors never gave in, never gave out, and certainly never gave up.   “Saint Augustine once said; “Pray as though everything depended on God.  Work as though everything depended on you.”  Rev. Dr. Salatheia Bryant-Honors looked to God for sustenance to fuel a boundless work ethic that allowed her to accomplish amazing things for her congregation and for the many who drew inspiration from her walk of faith.  May God bless her family and may she rest in peace.”  ###  Congresswoman Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

This day will always be remembered by all Americans as it tested the resilience of our Armed Forces and the will of our Nation.   “I salute the veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor who continue to inspire us.  Despite overwhelming odds, they heroically fought back against the enemy, inspired our nation and put us on the path to victory.  They are proudly known as members of that Greatest Generation.  These are men and women, who overcame the Depression, crossed oceans and stormed the beaches to defeat fascism, and later turned adversaries into our closest allies.    “When the guns fell silent, they came home, went to school on the G.I. Bill, and built the largest middle class in history and the strongest economy in the world.  They remind us that no challenge is too great when Americans stand as one.  All of us owe these men and women a profound debt of gratitude for protecting our freedoms and the standard of living we enjoy today.  “The battle at Pearl Harbor reminds us of the tremendous sacrifices our troops and their families make.  We are grateful to our military for their defense of this democracy.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the men and women currently deployed—we hope for their safe and speedy return.  “Today we honor the more than 3,500 Americans killed or wounded during that deadly attack and pay tribute to the heroes whose courage ensured our Nation would recover from such a vicious blow.” ###","status",NA,NA,22,56,3,2,4,0,0,1

A free and open internet is the single greatest technology of our time, and control of it should not be at the sufferance of big corporations.”  Houston, TX – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a member of the House Budget Committee, a senior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and Judiciary, and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, issued the following statement about the F.C.C.’s vote to dismantle net neutrality rules:  “Net neutrality rules enacted by the Obama Administration ensure that all Americans have equal access to an open flow of information when logging on to a computer, looking at a phone or turning on the TV.  As a Senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee, I have been steadfastly opposed to any effort resulting in the dismantling of these protections.  “That is why I am outraged over today’s reckless vote by the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission to scrap net neutrality rules, thus allowing the internet to be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.   In Texas alone, there are 17.1 million internet users which represents more than 68 percent of the state’s population.  “A free and open internet is the single greatest technology of our time, and control should not be at the mercy of big corporations.  Therefore, I am calling on the FCC to immediately rescind this misguided decision, which is an affront to our democracy, and threatens the public’s right to have free access to vital information.   Should the FCC fail to take this action, I am confident that the FCC’s action will be challenged and defeated in the courts.   “As a member of the Congressional Internet Caucus, I am determined to do whatever I can to protect net neutrality.”  ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

In her 23rd consecutive year hosting the event, the Congresswoman called the turnout indicative of the enormous needs of the community following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.  “Scores of Houstonians lost their property, their belongings, and in many instances, their jobs,” said Congresswoman Jackson Lee.  “Some parents attempting to rebuild have had to stretch their budgets just to put food on the table and have had little opportunity to purchase toys for their kids.  “That is what made this year’s toy giveaway such a welcome and timely event.  We received a record amount of donations which enabled us to bring comfort to storm-weary families and bring smiles to children’s faces.”  “None of this would have been possible without the tireless work of the many volunteers and organizations who gave their time, energy and resources to this worthwhile endeavor.”","status",NA,NA,48,201,10,10,9,0,0,34

Unfortunately, it looks like Grinch is trying to steal the spirit of the holiday.  Last Monday, I arrived at the airport to catch my flight to Washington to continue my fight to get Hurricane Harvey funds back to Texas and other hard hit areas, along with funding of the Children’s Health Insurance Program and of course, trying to stop a tax bill that was going to cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance.  After receiving my boarding pass, I boarded the plane in the normal process.  I did nothing wrong.  I asked for nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary and received nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary.  I proceeded to take my seat and work on legislative issues on my way to Washington.   Although I was not involved, I observed a disruption by an individual walking back and forth in the cabin.  I could overhear her speaking with a flight attendant (an African American woman).  I saw the gate agent go to the seat of the individual who was walking back and forth before we took off.    I later came to understand that the individual had canceled her own flight.  However I had nothing to do with that.  I noted that this individual came toward me and took a picture.  I heard later that she might have said “I know who she is.”  Since this was not any fault of mine, the way the individual continued to act appeared to be, upon reflection, because I was an African American woman, seemingly an easy target along with the African American flight attendant who was very, very nice.  This saddens me, especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people.  But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry.  I understand the airline is working to address the passenger’s concerns.  I am glad of that.  But as an African American, I know there are too many examples like this all over the nation. I hope one day, we will accept our collective diversity.  Happy Holidays.”","status",NA,NA,204,3408,142,25,390,14,40,531

Your input on how we can work against severe funding cuts or program changes to the ACA, moves that will weaken patient access to healthcare, is very important to me in my role as a member of the House Budget Committee. The future of the ACA will be one of the issues that the House Budget Committee will address, and your assistance in making the case for the ACA is essential in our work to save this law. Your firsthand knowledge about the ACA’s benefit to yourself, your family, community, healthcare facility, access to care, and patient wellbeing will be the focus of the forum.   Additionally, this will be an opportunity for Houston’s community health experts to share their views regarding the overall importance of the ACA, and what they believe are the most pressing challenges with healthcare. Texas not fully participating in the ACA Medicaid expansion; the numbers of indigent persons’ seeking medical assistance, the capacity of healthcare service providers to take care of the sick, and the devastating impact on seniors who benefited from the ACA regarding prescription drug costs if such benefits were lost, are what Congress should be focused upon instead of repealing the ACA.

Houston, TX – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, will host a news conference and march in response to the deadly shooting at the Haverstock Hill Apartments last Sunday.   The event will begin at 12:30pm, Sunday, 4/2/2017, at SonRise Community Church located at 5609 Mount Houston Road in Northeast Houston.  Following remarks at the church, Pastor Edward M Buford, residents of Haverstock along with local and federal members of law enforcement will join the Congresswoman in a march to the Haverstock Hill Apartments, located at 5619 Aldine Bender Road.  Should rain become an issue, the group will drive to Haverstock as opposed to marching.  One week ago, an argument erupted in gunfire that left two people dead and four others injured.  Among the injured was Brandy Rusher, a former contestant on America’s Next Top Model.  The Haverstock Hill Apartments has a long history of crime problems.  In 2010, law enforcement responded to more than 3,000 calls leading the county to file for its first ever gang injunction.  The temporary order was made permanent four years later when a judge banned dozens of accused gang members from a “safety zone” that included Haverstock. The suspects in last Sunday’s shooting have both been apprehended but for the victims and their loved ones, justice may seem hard to find.  “It’s tragic that we should even have to hold events like these,” said the Congresswoman.  “But we must take a stand to protect innocent life and push back against the deadly scourge of gun violence.”","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/1809134689350149/",NA,19,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The ACA guards and strengthens the health care and financial security of every American, no matter where he or she gets health insurance.  After years of a GOP fevered, fact-free crusade against the ACA, Republicans’ repeal plan will have cold, hard consequences for millions of Americans – causing millions to lose their health coverage, and costs to go up for millions more.  WHO: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee WHAT: Keep America Healthy Rally WHEN: Sunday 1/15/17 WHERE: Federal Building - 1919 Smith Street, Houston TIME: 2:00pm-3:30pm POC: 713-655-0050 Hashtags: #ACAworks #MakeAmericaSickAgain #ACA #ProtectOurCare  In the 115th Congress, in addition to repealing the ACA, House Republicans are also planning assaults on other key health care initiatives, such as Medicare, which millions of Americans depend on.  Every House GOP budget the GOP has passed since 2011 has attempted to end the Medicare guarantee by turning Medicare into a privatized voucher program, thereby shifting the brunt of the costs to seniors.  As The Hill has reported, “House Republicans pushing for action on Medicare say the next Congress, which convenes in January, might be their best opportunity to overhaul Medicare.”  Indeed, on December 4, on 60 Minutes, Speaker Paul Ryan outlined his desire to move forward on turning Medicare into a voucher program in this Congress.  * Before #ACA, 105 million Americans' employer-provided coverage had lifetime limits. Now, that’s zero – because ACA made them illegal.  * Thanks to #ACA ~2.3 million young adults were able to stay on their parents health plans.  * Don't think #ACAworks for you because you get coverage through work? You'd be wrong. ACA requires ALL plans to cover preventive care.  * Get this: #ACA provides 10 million Americans tax credits to help them get covered. (Hint: the average credit is $300 per month!)  * RT if you are ready to fight for women’s access to care and #ProtectOurCare!  * #ACAworks to reduce health care mistakes, with Medicare beneficiaries now avoiding ~565,000 return trips to the hospital. #ProtectOurCare","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/1844332605826032/",NA,71,8,0,1,0,0,0,0
