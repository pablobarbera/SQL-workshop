In essence, it’s a ban directed at Muslims - a clear violation of Constitutional protections against religious discrimination that rolls back our Nation’s long, hard fought battle for greater inclusion. In a nutshell, President Trump suspended entry of all refugees into the U.S. for four months, stopped Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. indefinitely, and banned citizens from seven predominately Muslim nations from coming to America for 90 days. These steps are both radical and unnecessary. To be clear, under new legislation passed with my support during the last session of Congress, we already have the toughest, most comprehensive refugee vetting process of any nation in the world. Before entering this country, refugees undergo 18 to 24 months of investigations by multiple U.S. intelligence agencies. It’s as good a process as is humanly possible to implement. That said, if there are things that need fixing, we should do it through comprehensive and bipartisan immigration reform – something Republican leaders have consistently refused to allow.","status",NA,NA,369,78,42,13,0,0,9,23

CHIP is vital to Minnesota and the entire nation. Without it, 9 million kids and pregnant mothers won’t have access to basic healthcare. In Minnesota, officials have already said they'll have to take “extraordinary measures” to keep everyone in the program covered.  Republican leadership has spoken through its actions. Instead of working on real healthcare reform and funding, they’ve spent their time on a series of failed “healthcare” bills that would have stripped coverage away from millions of Americans. Nothing has gotten done. They think programs like CHIP can wait.  But I don’t agree. CHIP can’t wait. Minnesota CHIP funding runs out by December.

The only way forward is to begin talking and finding areas where both Republicans and Democrats agree.   I want to work across the aisle on this issue. We owe it to the victims of this mass shooting – and all the ones before – to find solutions that both parties can agree on. We need to be debating legislation that strengthens background checks and mental health restrictions on buying firearms – proposals that a majority of Americans support.  But Speaker Ryan won’t allow the House of Representatives to consider any ideas on how to deal with gun violence in America. We can’t even bring bills to a vote. That’s why I participated in the House sit-in last year after the Orlando massacre, and that’s why I’m speaking out again today.  The duty of Congress is to listen, debate ideas, and vote on the best solution to protect the American people. The issue of mass shootings should not be an exception to this duty.

So to be clear, any tax reform bill must answer these THREE KEY QUESTIONS with a “YES” before I’ll support it.    1)  “Does it benefit middle class working families?” This is always my #1 priority. Our hardworking families deserve a tax plan that works for them – one that allows them to buy homes, get their kids through college, take vacations and save for retirement.   2)  “Does it ensure that Wall Street millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share?” In a country with continual income inequality, where the economic system is already rigged for the rich, real tax reform requires those at the top are paying their fair share. We can’t ask working families to pay more while cutting taxes for the rich.  3) “Does it incentivize multi-national corporations to create good paying jobs here in America?” Our American workers can’t afford a tax plan that incentivizes big corporations to ship their good paying jobs overseas. Real tax reform helps grow our economy here at home, reinvests in our people, and creates more good paying jobs.     The fact is, we can create millions of good paying jobs by restoring a fair distribution of wealth. When working families have more money in their pockets, they have a better quality of life, boost our economy, and create a better outcome for our Nation as a whole.

The fact of the matter is, birth control is health care. It helps improve women’s and children’s health, it reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy, and it empowers women and their families to make decisions about when to start and grow a family.   Despite all the benefits of birth control, the Administration’s final rules create “exemptions” that virtually any employer, insurance company, or school can use to deny women birth control coverage. In other words, employers and insurance companies have effective “veto power” in deciding whether or not they’re going to provide this coverage.    This is plain wrong. Women should not be singled out by rules that force them to pay more for common health care services.    And what’s more: These rules take effect immediately, even though there was NO open and transparent process where all key stakeholders were allowed to comment.    That’s why I’m demanding these rules be rescinded. The Administration must recognize the discriminatory nature of these rules, and engage in a normal process where they listen to women and health care professionals before changing laws.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/UsRepRickNolan/photos/a.390043131082887.96747.388085277945339/1492953777458478/?type=3",NA,342,78,58,22,0,2,4,16

As I’ve said, there are three things any budget or tax reform plan's got to do to get my vote:  1) Benefit working families. 2) Ensure that the rich pay their fair share. 3) Create good paying jobs.  The simple fact is, this budget fails the test on all three measures. It hurts working families, gives huge tax breaks to the rich, makes cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and destroys investment in good paying jobs.   Most of all, this budget fails to show the gratitude we owe for a century of American progress. It cuts the fundamental programs that enabled America to become the great Nation that it is, with doubled life expectancy, investments in infrastructure, technology, and medicine, and the strongest middle class the world has ever seen.   We've got a lot to be grateful for. I'll continue the fight for a better budget and tax system that benefits the middle class, and pays our progress forward towards a new century of American achievement and advancement.  https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/house-passes-budget-resolution-paving-way-tax-package/?utm_source=news-alert&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletters","link","https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/house-passes-budget-resolution-paving-way-tax-package/?utm_source=news-alert&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletters","rollcall.com",44,36,16,2,3,2,13,54

Markey on a bill to ensure that President Donald Trump cannot launch a first strike against North Korea without the approval of Congress.   The lives of billions of innocent people, and the future of the world as we know it, is at stake. Should President Trump launch a first strike against North Korea, it could easily escalate into a nuclear war with catastrophic consequences. A preemptive strike would also incentivize North Korea to attack the 23,468 U.S. military troops currently stationed in South Korea.    That’s why I’ve joined numerous colleagues in introducing legislation to stop President Trump from disregarding the Constitution and launching a first strike attack on North Korea without Congressional approval.   It’s important to note that this legislation does not stop the United States from responding and launching an attack if North Korea attacks the U.S. or its allies first.   The bill’s purpose is simply to put safeguards on a process that gives the President single-handed control to launch a first attack – even a nuclear attack – without a Congressional declaration of war, as the Constitution requires.  As always, diplomacy, not war, is our best chance and our strongest tool in dealing with nations like North Korea. I will continue to advocate for a diplomatic process to protect the lives of innocent people and the future of our world.  http://www.newsweek.com/us-preemptive-strike-north-korea-would-kill-millions-and-risk-unacceptable-war-693466","link","http://www.newsweek.com/us-preemptive-strike-north-korea-would-kill-millions-and-risk-unacceptable-war-693466","newsweek.com",213,38,18,12,1,2,6,2

The President has said that changes to 401(k)s are still on the table, and “and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.”  The retirement savings of hardworking Americans should NEVER be used as a ""bargaining chip"" in negotiations. Instead of threatening hardworking Americans' 401(k)s, we should be reinvesting in our middle class, protecting their retirement funds, and creating tax policy that actually creates good paying jobs for Americans.  The fact is, the GOP plan is just plain old trickle-down economics. That didn't help the middle class before, and it won't now either. The notion that as the rich get rich, they will invest their extra billions to create more jobs and help the middle class earn more is nonsense. Middle class wages have stagnated for 40 years, and America now has by far the most unequal distribution of wealth of any major country on Earth. The top 1% now earn more than the bottom 50% combined. And the top 1/10th of the one percent own as much wealth as the bottom 90%.  This threat to Americans' retirement savings is just one more attempt to tip the scales in the favor of the rich. I'll keep fighting against this tax plan, and demand reform that actually benefits middle class families and their futures.  http://thehill.com/policy/finance/357201-trump-gop-appear-open-to-401k-changes-in-tax-bill","link","http://thehill.com/policy/finance/357201-trump-gop-appear-open-to-401k-changes-in-tax-bill","thehill.com",43,25,39,0,0,8,3,61

That’s why I’m introducing a new bill, the Parity in Animal Cruelty Enforcement Act, to ensure that there is no refuge for animal fighters anywhere in the United States.  Right now, legal loopholes exist that leave doubt as to whether federal anti-animal fighting laws apply in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. As a result, “safe havens” can still exist where animal fighting operations are allowed to operate and profit from the terrible pain and suffering.   During fights, the animals are often drugged and forced to keep fighting even after they’ve suffered grievous injuries such as broken bones, deep gashes, punctured lungs and pierced eyes. In cockfighting, birds have metal weapons attached to their legs and typically suffer slow painful deaths.  Animal fighting is damaging to human communities, too. In places where animal fighting is present, associated crimes such as illegal drug dealing, gambling and violence follow in its wake.   As a society, we have an obligation to protect those without a voice, including animals who are cruelly forced to fight one another. By closing the loopholes and explicitly banning animal fighting, we can protect innocent animals, improve life for communities, and end this shameful practice once and for all.  http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2017/10/federal-legislation.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/","link","http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2017/10/federal-legislation.html?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F","humanesociety.org",128,18,25,9,0,0,0,0

I am deeply concerned that the United States may be committing itself to a long-term war in Niger and other parts of Africa.    The simple fact is, the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to authorize military force. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force must not be used as a blank check for more and more wars.   These wars of choice are incredibly costly for America. Not only in terms of defense spending, but also the human cost – as we saw with the deaths of the four American heroes in Niger.

When you look at a tax bill – any tax bill – it’s more than just a series of numbers.   It’s a statement of your beliefs.  So what does this tax bill say Republican leadership believes in?  Well, the bill gives a $1.7 trillion tax break to the super rich and corporations. So Republican leadership must believe that the rich deserve more than they already have.  The bill raises taxes on millions of middle class families. So Republicans must believe that working families can afford pay more in taxes.  And the bill adds massively to our deficit. So Republicans must believe that they can pass this huge debt on to future generations.  The simple truth is, this tax bill is nothing but a scam – a bill designed by Republican leaders who believe in all the wrong things.  Americans deserve a tax reform plan that embodies true middle class values - one that ensures the super-rich and corporations pay their fair share, one that gives working families a real shot, one that creates a brighter future for coming generations.

It is the most famous shipwreck in Great Lakes history, taking the lives of its entire crew of 29 men.   The SS Edmund Fitzgerald’s  main job was hauling iron ore from the mines on the shores of Minnesota to the steel mills in Ohio and Michigan. At the time, “The Fitz” was the largest ship ever to travel across the Great Lakes, and remains the largest to have ever sunk there. The ship was known by many other names, including “The Queen of the Great Lakes,” and later, tragically, “Titanic of the Great Lakes.”   On November 10th, 1975, the Edmund Fitzgerald SS was heading to Whitefish Point when a storm began brewing. By night, the swells reached 35 feet and the wind speeds surged to nearly 100 mph. A radio message was sent from the ship at 7:10 pm, assuring another boat that “We are holding our own.” It was the last message ever sent from the ship.   Later, rescue boats searched the area, but found only a pair of lifeboats and debris. The Edmund Fitzgerald had sunk, taking the lives of all 29 crew members, most of whom were from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio.   Each year on November 10th, the ship’s bell – which was recovered by divers – tolls 29 times for each member of the Edmund Fitzgerald crew, and a 30th time for the nearly 30,000 mariners who have lost their lives on the Great Lakes.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9vST6hVRj2A","video","https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9vST6hVRj2A",NA,160,10,52,12,0,1,34,0

The simple truth is, America has no business involving itself in this Saudi-led war in Yemen.  That’s why I introduced my amendment (which the House passed last July) declaring that none of the funds in the National Defense Authorization Act will be used to deploy ground troops in Yemen.  But the United States is still financially supporting this Saudi-led war, and that’s plain wrong – for three reasons.  First off, America’s support for this Saudi-led war in Yemen is unauthorized.   Congress never approved a declaration of war in Yemen. But right now, we are still financially supporting a Saudi air war and blockade in Yemen.  It’s time to put a stop to that.  Second, we are supporting a Saudi-led blockade that’s causing horrific starvation, disease, and death in Yemen.  This blockade has forced more than 7 million people in Yemen to the brink of starvation.   It has sparked the world’s largest cholera crisis in recorded history.   And more than eight thousand people in Yemen have been killed and nearly fifty thousand injured in air strikes and fighting on the ground. It is unconscionable to support this war.  And finally – I can’t say this enough – America is already involved in too many endless wars of choice in the Middle East.  It’s time to stop spending trillions on these wars and start reinvesting in America and our people. With just one trillion, we could eliminate student debt. Or revolutionize our infrastructure. Or find the cure for cancer, or diabetes, or Alzheimer's.

But under this bill, all passenger rights would be explained in plain English on one piece of paper. No “lawyerese” or fine print.   The simple truth is that airline consumers deserve to know their rights. That’s what this bill is really all about.  http://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/airlines-bumping-passengers-less","link","http://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/airlines-bumping-passengers-less","travelandleisure.com",35,6,6,0,0,0,0,0

If Congress misses that deadline, the federal government will largely SHUT DOWN - furloughing some 800,000 public employees and costing our Nation thousands of good paying jobs and billions of dollars.   Here’s what I think: If Congress can’t do its job and pass a spending bill, Congress shouldn’t get paid.   That’s why I introduced my “NO GOVERNMENT – NO PAY” Act, which would stop lawmakers in future Congresses from getting paid if the government shuts down. Congress would have to work full-time with no salary until they pass a government funding bill.   Government by crisis management is no way to run a country. It’s time for Congress to take responsibility for the consequences of failing to pass the federal budget on time by foregoing their own salaries.  http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/362094-trump-i-dont-see-a-deal-to-avoid-government-shutdown","link","http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/362094-trump-i-dont-see-a-deal-to-avoid-government-shutdown","thehill.com",189,81,43,11,1,3,6,41

Last night, the House passed --  with overwhelming bipartisan support -- my bill, H.R. 3115, the Superior National Forest Land Exchange Act, which finalizes a long-awaited land exchange in Northern Minnesota between the U.S. Forest Service and PolyMet Mining.   I’d like to make a few things very clear about this bill.   First, it does NOT involve the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in any way. I love the Boundary Waters, and I’ve spent wonderful times there with my family. In fact, I was one of the ORIGINAL COSPONSORS of the legislation that established the Boundary Waters as a protected area! I have never and will never support mining in the Boundary Waters, or any mining project that fails to meet our strict environmental protection standards.  Furthermore, the land exchange area is actually south of the Laurentian continental divide – meaning that water from that area PHYSICALLY CANNOT flow north into the BWCA. It’s geologically impossible.   Second, this bill does NOT APPROVE any mining project. Any proposed project would still have to go through the rigorous federal and state approval process in order to move forward. And if it can’t meet those standards, it doesn’t move forward.  Third, this legislation is a GOOD DEAL all around. It helps create good paying jobs on the Iron Range, and it opens up 2,000 acres of wetlands, lakeshore, and wild rice waters to the public. And it’s supported by a bipartisan majority of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation, Minnesota Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, Democratic and Republican leaders in the Minnesota legislature, and communities, businesses, private citizens, and economic development organizations throughout the region.   I understand the concerns of environmentalists, especially when it comes to protecting the BWCA. I too am absolutely committed to protecting those sacred areas. But this is an instance in which the facts just don’t line up – because this legislation has no chance of harming the Boundary Waters. I would never put my name on it if that were the case.   The simple fact is, this bill is an all-around good deal for jobs, for the public, and for the environment. I am proud to have supported it and look forward to its progress in the Senate.
