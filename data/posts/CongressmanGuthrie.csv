As we pause to remember those brave men and women who valiantly served our country that day, I wanted to share the story of my friend Chauncy Monroe.   I met with him a few weeks ago in Glasgow. Chauncy served in the U.S. Navy aboard LST 279 off the coast of France on June 6, 1944.  His ship crossed the English Channel 37 times to supply the Normandy beachhead. As he told me his story about that day, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel truly inspired by this brave man who risked everything for the sake of his country and our European friends and allies.   With everything that is happening in the world today ‚Äì the recent attacks in the United Kingdom and the continuing threat of terrorism and ISIS in particular ‚Äì we must remember one important thing: Good will ultimately triumph over evil. Chauncy and the brave men and women who fought for our freedom 73 years ago today are all the proof we need.   http://www.glasgowdailytimes.com/news/wwii-vet-gets-visit-from-rep-guthrie/article_5b92a810-4265-11e7-9473-03308a2ea651.html","link","http://www.glasgowdailytimes.com/news/wwii-vet-gets-visit-from-rep-guthrie/article_5b92a810-4265-11e7-9473-03308a2ea651.html","glasgowdailytimes.com",49,0,3,5,0,0,2,0

I wrote in Morning Consult about how we can improve the Medicaid waiver process. Currently, states can apply for waivers from longstanding Medicaid provisions to tailor the Medicaid program to their state. Virtually all states use waivers to test pilot programs or enroll patients in managed care or home and community based services.    Unfortunately, waivers often take a long time to be approved. This long, cumbersome process prevents states from using innovative solutions to help patients get the care they need. I believe there is room for Republicans and Democrats to work together to improve this waiver approval system.

I am proud to report that my bill, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017 (H.R. 1808), just passed the House of Representatives unanimously. I was proud to introduce this bill that will help protect missing, abused, and exploited children. I introduced similar legislation during the 113th Congress, which was signed into law.    What exactly does my bill do? In 1984, Congress created the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to help coordinate state and local efforts to recover missing children and protect and support kids who are victims of abuse and exploitation. The Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act ensures that NCMEC can continue its important work protecting children. It also encourages new and innovative ways to recover and protect children ‚Äì something desperately needed as technology has made it easier to exploit children.

During my first ever campaign for state senate, there was a rally in Bowling Green for his U.S. Senate campaign with Senator Bob Dole. Local and state candidates were not allowed to speak, but Senator Bunning pointed to me and said, ""If he's not speaking, I'm not speaking!"" I was allowed to speak.   Senator Bunning and his wife Mary raised a beautiful family. When I was concerned about public service and raising a family, Mrs. Bunning gave me great advice. She said, ""If we can do it with 9, you can do it with 3."" I have met many of Senator Bunning's children and grandchildren and am always impressed. In fact, his granddaughter Laura recently interned in my office. They are a wonderful family, and my prayers are with them today.","status",NA,NA,85,7,5,2,0,0,18,0
