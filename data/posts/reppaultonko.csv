These moves bring us further into the strange new world of Trumpcare where costs go up and quality goes down.   The President and Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to choke off parts of our healthcare system that were created or improved by the Affordable Care Act. They’re doing this even as those same Republicans struggle to come up with a real plan to replace it. This approach reminds me of a famous line from former Secretary of State Colin Powell: “you break it, you own it.”   Welcome to Trumpcare.","link","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-affordable-care-act-rules_us_58a487c8e4b094a129f12af9","huffingtonpost.com",65,42,94,0,1,10,15,96

Among other things, the bill:  - Authorizes significantly higher funding levels for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) so states get the resources they need to address their most pressing local water system needs.  - Increases funding for a grant program to remove lead pipes from public water systems. Lead pipes were banned more than three decades ago but there are still an estimated 3.3 to 10 million still in service.  Simply put, every life and every job depends on water. Yet for decades our federal government has allowed funding for our water systems to drip away. Now many of these aging systems have fallen into disrepair and many are reaching their breaking point, costing local taxpayers significantly more to fix than the systems would be to maintain.   Our bill confronts the challenge of these declining water systems head on, rapidly increasing the funding available to state and local governments to take on these critical infrastructure projects and helping communities in Flint and elsewhere manage the cost of removing lead pipes that poses a threat to their water security.","link","http://tonko.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=614","tonko.house.gov",287,21,27,18,0,0,0,0

It shows Republican leadership working on a plan to ration health services for seniors and working families and reward insurance companies for bad behavior prohibited under the ACA.   Even worse, they plan to gut Medicaid expansion support to states, shifting billions of dollars in costs onto middle class taxpayers in New York State and around the country.   The effect of this so-called plan would be a more expensive and less efficient healthcare system with millions fewer people covered and billions more dollars in the pockets of the wealthy. The system itself would return to the healthcare wild west where insurance companies would be free to rack up profits on the backs of patients and providers.

For 14 years Dr. Bob has provided primary care services to a severely underserved community in the City of Albany.  He says his ""patients are petrified"" about where they will get their care. He does not know what to tell them other than they will be taken care of regardless. For nearly a decade he took no salary and he seems prepared to do so again.  80% of Dr. Bob’s patients are on Medicaid and 12% are on Medicare. Right now, just 5% of his patients are uninsured, down from 15-20%. He described that as a 75% cut in his uninsured population as a result of Obamacare.  He also told me he has seen a long list of people over the course of his career whose lives were shortened immensely because they could not access medical care.

It’s long past time that we as a nation provide fairness in the workplace by ensuring equal pay for equal work, defend the right to choose, end violence against women, secure access to affordable childcare and healthcare for working families, and strengthen paid family leave.   I was proud to march with thousands of my constituents and millions of women all across the country during the Women’s March. We showed that we are united and that together we will stand up for one another and speak out for anyone being trampled over, run through or pushed aside. Women are not objects to be owned, objectified or treated as second class citizens. Women’s rights are human rights and human rights are women’s rights.   The Women’s March was an important moment to secure our rights to speak and be heard. Today, on International Women’s Day, as many observe the Day Without a Woman Strike, remember that women’s voices are the voices of our coworkers, our mothers, sisters, daughters, leaders, community members, consumers, and major economic players.   I stand with the many women today taking part in the Day Without a Women strike, and the millions more in New York State and throughout the nation who share these values.""

Trumpcare breaks that promise, driving up premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for everyone.   It also hits our nation’s seniors with a devastating “age tax,” or should we call it a “senior tax,” that will literally price many seniors out of the healthcare market.   Mr. Speaker, Trumpcare is a tax break for billionaires parading as a healthcare plan. It will do unimaginable harm to our rural hospitals and our economy.   The bill was written in secret. It was rushed through this chamber. And it represents a bigtime broken promise. I urge my colleagues to reject Trumpcare.","link","https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4662933%2Frep-tonko-calls-broken-promises-trumpcare","c-span.org",435,84,104,53,1,5,1,1

Let me say at the outset that I, along with every other Democratic Member of the Science Committee, oppose this bill. This is the third Congress in a row that the Majority has tried to ram this legislation through, and my Democratic colleagues and I have strongly opposed the bill every time.  The critical flaws in this bill haven’t changed from previous versions. Outside science, environmental, and public health groups have written to express their grave concerns as well.   Most notably, a group of public health organizations, including the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association, outlined the litany of anti-science provisions within the bill:  “As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:  -     Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that include their own expertise;  -     Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them these highly competitive grants;  -     Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have regularly sought their advice in the past;  -     Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues already include public notice and comment; and,  -     Reallocate membership requirements to increase the influence of industry representatives on the scientific advisory panels.”  This bill weakens EPA’s ability to use the best available science to safeguard public health protections for the American people.   I’d like to ask the Rules Committee today for an open rule, to allow Members who do not sit on the Science Committee to have an opportunity to make changes to this regrettable bill. I am happy to answer any questions the Committee may have.  Thank you.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10154975561236405/",NA,87,21,9,3,0,0,0,4

Tonko","2017-03-28","2017-03-28 20:40:00","Speaking out on the House floor against S.J.Res. 34 a bill that would eliminate three simple, commonsense FCC Internet Privacy Rules:  1. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) must get your permission before it is allowed to sell your browsing, search, location and other data including your financial, medical and other highly personal information that data may contain. 2. ISPs have to take reasonable measures to secure your data, including browsing, cookies, search, etc. 3. Your ISP is required to inform you if your data is hacked or otherwise compromised through their service.  My statement:  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 34, a bill that would strike most of the Internet privacy guarantees protecting the American people today.  I have grave concerns with this effort. Our agenda here should be to work on behalf of our constituents to protect their privacy and give them, not their service providers, data security. Instead this effort would eviscerate any real online privacy protections and would limit data security.   Some of my colleagues have claimed that this commonsense rule has created challenges for consumers. I have found just the opposite. My office had been inundated with calls demanding that Congress protect their privacy and data security by opposing S.J.Res. 34.   To everyone who has called, I hear you and I stand with you in opposing this harmful and misguided effort.   Back at home in New York’s Capital Region, I have been hearing from many people who are frightened by the thought that this bill will become law and the last shred of their online privacy will be lost forever.    They know how much information their Internet Service Provider has mined from their search and browsing history, including financial, medical and other very personal and sensitive details. And they rightly believe that they should have a say in when that information can be bought and sold.   They understand that gutting these privacy protections would mean that internet service providers could sell their private information without their permission.    It means their private internet browsing and search history, the text of their emails, and their mobile app usage can all be sold without their permission.  They have a right to control who has access to where they are, what they search for, their financial information, their health information and information about their children. They have a right to protect their Social Security numbers and the content of their emails. These rights are enshrined in our Constitution.   Privacy Rules also require providers to use “reasonable measures” to protect consumers’ personal information, a clear and common-sense standard that all who do business online should be required to uphold.   And, finally, internet service providers must notify customers if hackers breach the system and may have accessed their private data. With hackers from Russia and elsewhere running rampant across the net, this is a critical provision for America’s families.   This is not too much to ask.   The American people deserve to know that their data will be protected and that they will be notified if their data is compromised. Without these important protections consumers will have few options to protect themselves from identity theft, data breaches, and financial fraud.  S.J. Res. 34 would undo these critical FCC rules that protect Americans privacy and data security.  For these reasons I urge a no vote on this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10154975688516405/",NA,214,53,51,17,0,3,0,0

I know for example, that everything, from a steel beam to a parachute, has a certain very small probability of failure.   We have to account for uncertainty to be able to build large buildings and great structures that last for generations.   We do the math. We check our work and we test it.   We go back over time and shore up any weak spots.  And when everyone does their part to build and maintain and test them, these structures stay strong.  Science works in a similar way, thriving on the uncertainty that lives between evidence and conclusions  So when a few individuals express doubt about climate change, scientists listen, check their theories against the available data and continue to observe and improve.   But, like the failure rate of that steel beam, the uncertainty in climate change science is known and negligible.   For every one scientist who disputes the fact that human activity is driving climate change, there are seventeen thousand three hundred fifty-two who acknowledge human activity is the main driver of climate change. (SOURCE: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0270467616634958)  So if we have a handful of scientists here in this room today who are skeptical about the human role in climate change, there are tens of thousands more credible, trained scientists out in the world standing up for the scientific fact that humans are the major driver of climate change.    It is notable that those tens of thousands of scientists are represented here solely by Dr. Mann. I want to thank Dr. Michael E. Mann for being here today and representing this overwhelming consensus.  The scientific community thrives on skepticism and uncertainty. But denial is something different.   Unlike healthy scientific skepticism, climate change denial stands today as one of the great pillars in the pantheon of political manipulation.   Decades ago, major players in the fossil fuel industry saw the issue of climate change gaining popular attention.   They also realized that any serious effort to reduce carbon pollution and greenhouse gases could be a death blow for their industry.   So, instead of embracing the clear evidence in front of them that fossil fuels contribute to climate change, they launched one of the most successful misinformation campaigns in American history. Right up there with the tobacco industry lying about cancer risks.   In 1998, the fossil fuel industry laid out their misinformation strategy and tactics in something they called the “Global Climate Science Communications Action Plan.”   I’d like to enter this document into the record. This Action Plan said:  “Victory Will Be Achieved When:”  •        “Average citizens “understand” (recognize) uncertainties in climate science;”  •        “Media “understands” (recognizes) uncertainties in climate science.”   The plan also called for identifying, recruiting and training a team of “independent scientists to participate in media outreach.”   Their cause was not to better science or public education, it was to undermine the ability of science to inform our public and private decisions.   The plan was devised by one dozen people from the oil and gas industry, along with communications strategists -- PR professionals. One of those individual’s was Myron Ebell whose name has recently surfaced again because he led President Trump’s transition team at the EPA.   And it seems certain from EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s recent actions that he will be more interested in strategic communications and parlor tricks to distract the public from the reality of climate change than actually attempting to address these serious problems.   Dr. Mann, can you talk a little bit about how you see these sorts of tactics and distraction techniques being played out in the discussions about climate change?","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10154977679211405/",NA,213,45,90,31,1,1,0,5

This bill would be devastating to EPA's ability to safeguard public health and put America far behind the rest of the world on #climatechange.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act.  I have serious concerns with this bill the majority has offered. This bill pretends to improve scientific integrity and transparency while in reality they would stop EPA from doing its critical job of protecting the American people.   Many credible organizations have opposed the HONEST Act including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Union of Concerned Scientists, American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund.   The Union of Concerned Scientists has said recently that “the bill effectively prevents the EPA from using the weight of scientific evidence to protect public health and the environment… This doesn’t make sense.”   I agree. This doesn’t make any sense.   Instead, I hope that as a congress we can turn our attention to truly protecting scientific integrity. We must protect the scientific process from political interference which is why I recently introduced the Scientific Integrity Act, which would require U.S. federal agencies to adopt or strengthen policies to insulate government-directed research from the influence of political pressure and special interests.   Under the Scientific Integrity Act, federal agencies that conduct or fund scientific research would be required to develop clear written scientific integrity policies that can guarantee research is being done and published without undue influence, censorship or distortion.   Scientific and technological information would be able to flow more easily while protecting privacy, confidentiality and national security. 24 separate federal agencies have developed scientific integrity policies to-date. This legislation would also codify and strengthen these policies within a common framework.  Every Democrat on the Science committee has supported the Scientific Integrity Act and I invite all my colleagues across the aisle to join us in working to truly protect scientific integrity.   I urge a no vote on the so called “Honest” Act and yield back the balance of my time.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10154978017091405/",NA,90,4,5,5,0,0,0,2

I am proud to join my colleagues in taking this time to speak about the critical importance of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).   At a time when some are arguing that we must cut our way to success, I would remind them that investments in the arts and humanities are investments in our workforce and our economy. I fully support funding for these programs.  The National Endowment for the Arts provides a foundation for America’s artistic excellence, creativity, and innovation that benefits individuals, communities and our industries.   As NEA Chairwoman Jane Chu said, “Although many may not realize it, the arts actively intersect with areas such as the economy, human development, and community vitality.” The NEA, as a strong sponsor of the arts and artists, is an integral source of strength at these intersections – challenging students to turn imaginative ideas into brilliant solutions for generations to come.  Art in our communities, and especially in our schools, is vital. It is one of the most important ways that we celebrate our unique regional heritage and expand our own horizons of creativity and innovation.  In the Capital Region of New York, the area I am proud to represent, we value the arts. So much of our artistic achievement would not be possible without the National Endowment for the Arts.   For many years the Albany Symphony Orchestra has received NEA grants in support of the American Music Festival.  The The Arts Center of the Capital Region has received NEA grants for exhibitions, workshops and master classes.   Yaddo has been the recipient of many NEA grants to support residencies for collaborative teams.   Fence (magazine), uses NEA grants for publication of books of poetry and podcasts.   Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) was just awarded a NEA grant for residencies to create works investigating the intersection of art, media, technology, and science.   Without the NEA, these programs would not be there to enrich our communities and our lives.   National Endowment for the Humanities awards also support research and innovation, strengthen critical thinking and writing skills, as well as strengthens humanities education in all institutions of learning.  Supporting the growth of the humanities in our communities is just as essential. The National Endowment for the Humanities has contributed in many ways to the Capital Region, which has a rich history and heritage worthy of preservation and celebration.  Many of our institutes of higher education have benefitted from these grants including RPI, Skidmore College, Union College and University at Albany, SUNY.   Some of the projects that have been funded by NEH include the Underground Railroad History Project of the Capital Region, Inc. which is exploring the complex relationship between the Underground Railroad, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction in our region, as well as the influence of those events on contemporary society.   Investments in the humanities also drive us to be better citizens.  NEH has supported the League Of Women Voters of NYS Education Foundation, which is working towards the celebration of women’s right to vote and the 100th anniversary of the League of Women voters in NYS to celebrate the upcoming events commemorating the women’s suffrage centennial.   Grant recipients include the Girl Scouts, the Troy Boys & Girls Club, libraries, museums, high schools and elementary schools.   Our history reminds us of the pride that comes with developing community and neighborhood, investments that those who came before us made in growing families, developing households, building neighborhoods in powerful and meaningful ways.  This conversation is also closely linked to two other important fields that are entwined with the arts and humanities. First, I am a longtime supporter of America’s heritage areas- special places that have played important roles in shaping our nation. They tell the stories of the people and communities whose pioneer spirit laid the foundations of our society.   Heritage Areas provide enormous economic benefits. I greatly appreciate the work that the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor and Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area have done for Upstate New York. As the co-chair of the Congressional National Heritage Area Caucus, I continue to be impressed by how the entire National Heritage Areas program operates on a very small budget. These cost-effective programs create jobs and grow local economies.  In fact, each federal dollar invested in this program leverages more than $5 dollars in non-federal funds. That’s exactly the kind of smart investing we need to see more of.  Thank you to the 77 members who joined me in supporting funding for heritage areas.   I am also supporting funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services because museums are a vital part of our communities and educational infrastructure.   Museums are economic engines – employing 400,000 Americans, spurring local tourism and contributing to the cultural fabric of our nation. Each year, museums directly contribute more than $20 billion in their communities.   More than that, museums preserve our history and help to create a sense of place.   During my time in Congress, I have been a steadfast advocate for our nation’s museums and I have urged my colleagues to robustly fund the Institute of Museum and Library Services, or IMLS – the primary agency that supports our nation’s 33,000 museums.    IMLS is highly accountable, and its competitive, peer-reviewed grants serve all states.    This year we had 166 members sign on to a bipartisan letter to ensure robust funding for the Office of Museum Services.  I am deeply concerned by the proposal to eliminate funding for the NEA, NEH, IMLS and Heritage Areas. These programs are essential to our communities and to our nation.   There has never been a more important moment for us to fight for our highest American values and the institutions that make our nation great. I will continue to fight for these critical programs. I take heart in knowing that you are in the fight with me. We have already seen the power we have when we band together and speak up for what we value most.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155002868441405/",NA,306,54,61,55,0,0,0,1

Last night’s airstrikes appear to have narrowly targeted Al Shayrat airfield in what seems to have been a measured response. However, I am concerned that this could be a sign of more to come. I was skeptical of increasing U.S. military engagement in Syria under President Obama and that skepticism continues under President Trump.   Before escalating U.S. military actions in Syria any further, President Trump must do the following:  First, the President must articulate a clear strategy for the region that includes a plan to bring an end to this conflict. The American people and the U.S. service-members who would be put in harm's way deserve it.  Second, President Trump must come to Congress for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. Congress should thoroughly and publicly debate the merits and risks of the President’s proposal.  Finally, President Trump must continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the region and resume offering refuge to innocent Syrians, who are victims of their brutal government and terrorist organizations.  Ultimately, the Syrian Civil War will not be ended by a missile strike. It requires a diplomatic solution. I encourage President Trump to engage with the other governments of the world, including President Assad's supporters in Russia, to bring an end to this conflict.","link","http://tonko.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=624","tonko.house.gov",289,43,58,17,0,0,0,1

I know this is an issue you are passionate about, so I welcome the opportunity to hear more views on this discussion draft.  I also want to welcome our colleagues Reps. Titus, Kihuen, Rosen, and Wilson for joining us this morning. And Senator Heller for making the trip from the Senate side.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate you accommodating Mr. Kihuen’s request to hold a Member Panel. Last year we heard from some of our Nevadan colleagues, including Ms. Titus, at a nuclear waste hearing.  Since then, we have welcomed two new Members from the Nevadan delegation to the House. It is important for us to hear their views.  Similarly, since our last hearing, we have had a change in administration.  President Trump’s initial budget proposal includes a $120 million effort to “restart licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository and to initiate a robust interim storage program.”  Clearly, this is a change in policy from the previous administration, which had not requested funding for the Yucca license application for a number of years and began to develop a “consent-based” approach.  It is indeed important to get this Administration’s feedback on this bill as well as a better sense of their policy on the future of America’s nuclear waste.  I also want to highlight a concerning trend.   This is the third legislative hearing this year in this subcommittee where we have not had a witness or feedback from the Administration.  We need to hear from them and should not rush forward without having a better understanding of its position.  Today, there is over 72,000 metric tons of waste, which is expected to grow as a number to 139,000 metric tons by 2067. More and more reactors are shutting down— many of them are going through decommissioning early.  There is no question our nation has serious nuclear waste challenges. As we will hear, some of these are political, but there are also technical and transportation issues.  I understand these are very difficult challenges, but if we continue to ignore the problem, taxpayers—from every state—will pay the price.  In December 2015, CBO testified before this subcommittee on the federal government’s liabilities under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  Courts have determined that DOE has breached contractual obligations under this statute. DOE was scheduled to start removing waste by 1998.  After the government missed this deadline, utilities began suing for damages, which have been paid from the Treasury’s Judgment Fund.  At the time of our previous hearing, those payments totaled $5.3 billion, which has only continued to grow.  DOE estimated that if it could begin to accept waste within the next 10 years, liabilities would ultimately total $29 billion.  So I understand the urgency of the issue. And I understand the Chair’s genuine desire to help communities dealing with waste and protect taxpayers from any further need to make payments from the Treasury.  But I am not sure that the continued strong linkage between Yucca and an interim solution is the best option to limit further taxpayer liability.  The draft before us takes a number of steps to solve our nation’s nuclear waste problems. Some of which I think are positive, but many provisions will not bring us to a solution any quicker.  The bill authorizes interim storage that can be operated by DOE or a private contractor, but it prohibits any interim projects from moving forward until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission makes a final decision on a construction authorization for a permanent repository.  We know there are companies interested in pursuing interim storage, but this link may create unnecessary uncertainty to their financing and business model.  It would be possible for us to consider the merits of interim storage and a long-term repository on separate but parallel tracks.  Also, I know many Members care about states’ rights. And those from the West are especially sensitive about water rights.  This bill would declare the construction of a nuclear waste repository a beneficial use of water. I find this troubling. It is not an issue we need to consider at this time.  There are many Members on this Committee, on both sides of the aisle, that would like to see a fair outcome that acknowledges these challenges, finds workable solutions, and protects the American taxpayers.  But ultimately, if you have confidence in the new Administration— and frankly, I do not, but there are many on the majority’s side that do— you should trust them to move the ball forward on a long-term nuclear waste repository.  Regardless of the text before us today, a permanent solution will take many years and be mired by litigation.  In the meantime, we may want to examine the steps Congress can take to start resolving the issue now. I am not wholly convinced that this draft, as currently written, would accomplish that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to this morning’s discussion. With that, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155068251646405/",NA,47,8,4,4,1,1,0,0

President Trump promised during the campaign that our working families would never be forgotten again. He has forgotten to keep that promise.  This President promised to get lobbyists and special interests out of our government.   Then he filled his Cabinet with former lobbyists, Wall Street and oil company executives, and other billionaires.   Now reports are coming out that numerous members of his Administration were exempted from his widely-publicized 5 year lobbying ban.    Therefore, it is no surprise that his policies again and again put corporate interests ahead of America’s middle class and working families.   President Trump promised to punish companies that outsource American jobs.   Instead, he has continued to award lucrative government contracts to these outsourcing companies, rewarding them for bad behavior and doing nothing to hold other bad actors accountable.    As a candidate, Donald Trump called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever approved in this country.  He promised to hold China accountable for its bad behavior on trade.   Mexico and Canada called his bluff this week on NAFTA.   And instead of accountability, Trump has offered China sweetheart trade benefits to get them to keep promises they had already made in dealing with North Korea.   This President talks a good game but his deception and broken promises are catching up to him.   America’s working families are watching.   They know the difference between alternative facts and real results.   We all do.   I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155074371036405/",NA,250,74,43,32,1,2,2,7

The energy challenges facing the United States today are real and growing. The only way to meet these challenges is by investing in research and development.   Having an R&D portfolio that covers the spectrum, from advances in basic sciences to cutting-edge technology development, testing and deployment, greatly augments the critical work being done by our private sector and at our nation’s colleges and universities.    Sustained support of these advances produces significant economic dividends for the United States, lowering costs and improving performance of widely-used energy technologies.  President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget proposal would deal a critical blow to U.S. cutting-edge innovation and research in the energy field.   It would carve away at critical programs including the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy’s Office of Science and even the visionary energy advancements being achieved through ARPA-E, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy with a proven record of moving the horizon of energy research forward.  At a time when we should be adding to our investments in our nation’s future, these cuts would put American research and innovation far behind that of other nations.  Many Members claim to support an “all of the above” strategy for energy production. I believe we also need an all of the above energy research strategy to complement it.  I recognize the value of federal fossil fuel research when it helps us to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, improve efficiency and protects Americans’ public health and safety.  That is why I have introduced bipartisan legislation to authorize a gas turbine efficiency R&D program.   Without Department of Energy support, we will lose our nation’s advanced manufacturing edge to countries that are investing in advanced turbine research. Instead, with appropriate investments in turbine efficiency research, we can be saving and creating American jobs while we are working to reduce emissions.  Simply put, an “All of the Above” approach cannot be limited to oil and gas technology. We must support research targeting renewables, storage, grid modernization, and all other viable options to secure our nation’s energy independence and our global leadership in energy innovation.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155088080941405/",NA,73,10,11,6,0,1,0,0

As the Science Committee’s only New Yorker, I would like to start off by welcoming SUNY Stony Brook Professor Clinton Rubin who is also the Director of the Long Island Science Hub. Thank you for educating us today but more importantly thank you for the passion you bring to the table and for all of your hard work. And welcome to all of our panelists.   I am excited that we are holding this hearing today because I strongly believe in the value of the SBIR/STTR program.   This program has proven to be one of the most successful federal programs for technological innovation in U.S. history, delivering more than 70,000 patents, close to 700 public companies, and approximately $41 billion in venture capital investment as well as valuable innovations in agriculture, defense, energy, health sciences, homeland security, space, transportation, and other fields.  Through Phase I and Phase II SBIR, countless jobs have been created in the Capital Region of New York. It is through programs such as SBIR that my district has developed the underpinnings of support for a boom in high technology innovation and economic development.  This funding has resulted in cutting edge technologies, well-paying jobs and overall has been a recipe for successful innovation. The Capital Region is an exponentially growing area for clean energy technology and biotechnology. I want to ensure that the support for these areas continue growing stronger. Smart investments like SBIR and STTR will allow for this type of continued growth.   I am proud of and inspired by the research and innovation in small businesses in the Capital Region which are venues that have greatly contributed to advances in science and technology across the board. From conversations I have had with small business leaders, I can see that they value this program.   Dr. Clinton Ballinger, the CEO of SelfArray, Inc in Troy, New York told me “My biggest issue as a CEO of a startup is to keep the federal SBIR program funded. The venture capital community has grown very risk averse and simply does not invest until a new technology is nearly developed. Some technologies cannot be self-funded by the inventors and this is where the SBIR program really helps.”    I also heard from Ted Eveleth, the CEO of HocusLocus, LLC in Albany, New York. Ted said that the reality he encounters is that companies don't perform research and development anymore because it is too risky and shows up as an immediate expense.   Ted said, “this is true from life sciences companies to old line manufacturing companies. Without the SBIR program, innovation in the US would come to a screeching halt.” While in Austria Ted listened to a panel discussion with representatives from four different countries talk with awe about the SBIR innovation machine and how they were trying to imitate it in their countries.    Ted summed up their thoughts by saying that the SBIR program makes the United States the envy of the world. I couldn’t agree more.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155091181176405/",NA,37,4,3,2,0,0,0,0

""Mr. Speaker, I rise to call urgent attention to America’s drinking water infrastructure.  Every day, more than 700 water mains break in cities, towns and villages all across the United States.  Every day, seven billion gallons of clean drinking water are lost due to leaks and breaks in our water infrastructure.   That’s treated water, and our tax dollars, down the drain.  With as many as 10 million lead service lines in use today, and dozens of new, unregulated contaminants, the threat to public health goes far beyond Flint, Michigan and Hoosick Falls, New York.  The federal government has a duty to protect the people of this country. We must act decisively to address this growing challenge.  We maintain roads, bridges, ports, railways, and so much more.  But our investment in water systems has not kept up, and now these systems are failing.  Many state and local governments can’t keep up. They need our help. This job needs to get done now, this year, in this budget.  I urge you to join me in supporting H.R. 1071, The AQUA Act and let’s respond to our nation’s drinking water challenges with strength.    Thank you.""","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155130075806405/",NA,122,26,21,12,0,0,0,1

These problems will only get worse if we continue the decades-long trend of neglect.  I know we have limited time, so I will not restate all the details of our growing national need to invest in drinking water systems and update the Safe Drinking Water Act.  This Subcommittee has been building a tremendous record that more than justifies the need for action.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate you holding this hearing and offering a discussion draft to bring attention to our hidden infrastructure, which has been out of sight and out of mind for far too long.  This draft responds to many of the issues that have been identified in previous hearings— the need to reauthorize the Drinking Water SRF and the Public Water Systems Supervision program, as well as the need to encourage asset management plans, greater source water protection, and support for disadvantaged communities.  With that said, I believe we can improve upon the draft before us today, which will ensure strong bipartisan support moving forward.  There are a number of Democratic bills that have already been introduced that can help inform these efforts.  The AQUA Act includes provisions on how to further assist disadvantaged communities and better incentivize asset management plans. It would also help fulfill a stated goal of this Administration— mandating Buy America requirements.  Mr. Pallone’s SDWA Amendments would enable EPA to promulgate much-needed national standards. The bill also creates programs to reduce lead in schools, among other important SDWA updates.  Mr. Peters’s has a bill to provide grants to assist systems with resiliency, source water protection, and security in the face of changing hydraulic conditions, such as drought, sea level rise, and other emerging pressures on systems.  We know the national need is growing—$384 billion over the next two decades to maintain current levels of services. We need to have the vision to acknowledge that this does not account for stresses—environmental and financial— that will continue to get worse if we do nothing.  Finally, the Drinking Water SRF has been a tremendous success. I am grateful that Chairman Shimkus is undertaking the first funding reauthorization since its inception in 1996. But as we will hear today, the draft includes unspecified funding levels. As a candidate, President Trump called for tripling funding for both SRF programs.  The AQUA Act proposes levels that are in line with what states handled following the Recovery Act.  I think these are good targets to start negotiations. We must recognize that local governments are struggling, significant amounts of projects go unfunded each year, and the status quo of federal support will not reduce the massive and growing levels of need. It is time for the federal government to step up and contribute our fair share.  Mr. Chairman, I would end by asking for a commitment to sit down with our side, learn more about some of our proposals, and work together to make this a truly bipartisan effort moving forward. We had close cooperation on the brownfields reauthorization draft. I think we can get to a similar place on drinking water. With that, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155135671126405/",NA,86,17,7,9,1,0,0,0

Like you, I am alarmed by the recent dismissal of science advisory board members at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and especially with the stated intention of packing the board with industry experts.   On a panel whose most significant responsibility is to evaluate science and public policy, independent scientists literally will not have a seat at the table.   This dismissal of scientists, and of science, signals a dramatic shift toward federal policies that would put well-funded political and special interests ahead of the facts. The science that informs our national defense, health, economic and other public policies that impact millions of Americans is under threat and, by this troubling action, officially on notice.   A few weeks ago, I spoke before a crowd of thousands at the March for Science - Albany, NY/Capital District. I mentioned H.R. 1358, the Scientific Integrity Act. This bill would require science watchdogs in every federal agency involved in scientific research. As threats to independent, federally-funded scientific research continue to grow, so must our ability to protect against them.   The issue of scientific independence is not partisan; we have seen presidents and political leaders from both major parties attempt to influence government-backed scientific findings. The result is often the same: public policy that may not reflect the best interests of the American people.   If we want our publicly-funded science to be free, independent and reliable, federal science must be able to protect itself from political and industry pressures.   World leaders have started to appeal to America’s scientists and engineers by arguing that other nations value their work more than the United States does. This is a sign that America’s global leadership in science and innovation may be weakening.   This is not the first time science has been marginalized in America, but each time it finds a way to return and flourish as conditions improve. And it is not too late nor too hard for us to stand up now and safeguard our public science.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155147719171405/",NA,53,1,16,3,0,1,0,3

Janice from Albany wrote to me last year about the drug she takes to manage her mental illness. Her monthly cost went from $9 to $342. That’s not right.  Irene from Hagaman has seen her monthly prescription jump from $35 to $250. That’s not right.   Mario, a retiree from Fort Johnson, is paying $900 for a 3 month supply of his reflux medication. That’s not right.  Regina from Rexford saw the monthly cost of her rheumatoid arthritis medicine jump from $2,800 to $3,700 in just one year. That’s just plain wrong.  Despite these stories – these cries for help from our constituents – what has Congress done? All talk, no action.  President Trump made lowering prescription drug prices a centerpiece of his campaign. What has he done since then? All talk, no action.  Today, we finally have a chance to take action.  America leads the world in the development on new and innovative life-saving cures, and that’s something we should be proud of and continue to cultivate.  But we should be ashamed of the fact that often times our own citizens don’t have effective access to these innovative treatments.  I fully understand that drug pricing is a complicated issue and that we don’t want to stifle American innovation that will help to create the next generation of life-saving treatments.  But it’s not that complicated to believe that, in the richest nation on earth, no one should have to go bankrupt to obtain a life-saving medicine.  A recent poll found that both Republican and Democratic voters agree in making this the number one priority for Congress. Let’s make it happen for the American people.  This situation must be fixed. We can take a good first step and show that we understand the importance of the issue with this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this common sense amendment.  I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155195791236405/",NA,186,96,26,15,2,0,10,4

This agreement was a powerful symbol of America’s strength and global leadership.   It promised a bright future for our nation and the world powered by clean energy.   America was poised to lead that clean energy revolution. Instead, the world is now making plans to move ahead without us.   Jobs will be created without us. New industries will be born and new innovative technologies manufactured, without us.   If we stick with this President’s decision, America will be on the outside looking in.   I want to make one thing perfectly clear: I’m still in.   So are more than 1,000 of America’s most forward-thinking cities, states, universities, and businesses, including the cities of Albany, New York, Schenectady, New York, and Saratoga Springs, NY, Union College and Skidmore College, and University at Albany, SUNY.  And so are millions of our fellow Americans in communities in every single Congressional district across our great nation.  Together we will embrace the climate economy, even if our President does not.  President Trump’s decision is a scar on America’s image. But the American people will continue to demand leadership on reducing carbon pollution. Our children, our grandchildren, are counting on us.   Let's not fail them.

Thus far, congressional committees, law enforcement investigations and press scrutiny have focused on Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin’s successful efforts to disrupt the American political process.   ""But a review of the available evidence and the accounts of Kremlin-watchers make clear that the Russian government is using the same playbook against other pillars of American society, foremost among them the military.

Yesterday's shooting was a shock for us all. I remain deeply saddened that such an attack could happen on a group of our nation's most dedicated public servants, and distressed that it seems ready to push us even further apart.  Whether we see madness in yesterday's violence or some demented political vendetta, we cannot let such acts deepen our divides. Even when our disagreements are at their most intense, let us remind one another to be as civil and as thoughtful as we can. Let us find a way to listen to one another. Our republic cannot stand if we simply confirm our own beliefs and never risk being challenged. America's long arc of progress should give us faith that over time our best ideas win out. And there is always more that unites us as Americans than divides us.  To quote my friends Al Green and Paul Ryan, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. If we are to make this event mean something, let it mean that we hold fast to our faith that, even in our deepest disagreements, we all seek to make America a more perfect Union.

America’s refugee resettlement program is a small but powerful humanitarian expression of America’s values and founding principles  And, just as important, it makes us safer.    Refugees go through vetting that is already extreme. If there is any doubt about a refugee’s identity, he or she is not admitted. The process is so rigorous, there hasn’t been a single fatal terrorist attack carried out by a refugee in the U.S. since the Refugee Act became law in 1980.   Americans across the country support resettlement. America's faith communities are leading the call for America to stand by her principles and shelter the fleeing victims of our enemies, including the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Albany in my own 20th district of New York.   That’s because it speaks directly to American values of strength, inclusiveness, and compassion.  New Yorkers have played a vital role in the resettlement program and refugees are positively contributing to communities across New York and beyond.   The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants Albany Field Office has helped resettle refugees from Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, the Ukraine, and the Congo, just to name a few.   Some of these refugees are single mothers seeking a better life for themselves and their children.  Others are families fleeing war and persecution.   We have the strength, the means and the capacity to welcome these refugees with open arms.   Let us stand with these huddled masses and remain a beacon of freedom around the world.

Tonko","2017-06-21","2017-06-21 16:25:31","Thank you Madam Chair,  We must push forward to ensure that we are expanding high speed Internet access across the nation.   For many people the expansion of broadband is moving too slowly and leaving them behind. Broadband access is critical for both education and economic development.   In the digital age of the 21st Century, broadband is essential to how we communicate, exchange information, conduct business and engage in the democratic process. From young children working on school assignments to college students studying for exams to adults working from home or running a small business, easy and affordable Internet access has become an integral part of our daily lives.   I hear from my constituents all the time about the lack of access to broadband Internet throughout our region. Some of these areas are rural and mostly unserved. Other areas are underserved with a few houses having access while many others are left with no with affordable options in sight.   People ask “When will we get access? What about western Schenectady County, what about Amsterdam, what about Berne, what about Ft. Johnson, what about Western Saratoga County?   I have heard from doctors who depend on the Internet to read X-rays when they are on call, from librarians who see students sitting in the parking lot after hours so they can access the Internet to finish homework, from workers who are forced to leave their home to find high enough speed internet that they can upload and download large files. They all ask “When will we have access to broadband?”  As a committee, we owe all of these people an answer. I appreciate that we are holding this hearing today but we must take action. A lack of access to broadband Internet in the Capital Region is one of many reasons why I made it a priority to join this very committee. Let’s work together to invest where we need to so that we can give these communities the investments and commitments they deserve.   I am especially proud that New York State is helping to the lead the way on expanding broadband especially in upstate New York.   This year, I worked with Governor Cuomo and the New York Congressional delegation to secure more than $170 million in funding to expand broadband and high speed internet access in upstate NY. This will be added to funding that Governor Cuomo has already designated to provide funding to install high-speed internet access across New York State. The program has raised the goals for internet access speeds, with an aim of 100 Mbps across New York and 25 Mbps in the most remote and rural areas.   I hope that by partnering with states such as New York--states that are dedicating their own funds to broadband deployment--we will create a positive incentive and encourage other states to create their own broadband funding programs.   I am concerned that some of the census block data that is relied on to determine if communities are served might show a misleading picture especially in communities that may be partially served.

President Trump called the House #Trumpcare bill ""mean."" He's right! Only 17% of Americans supported #Trumpcare last time. Just 8% wanted the Senate to stick to the same terms.   Now we know the Senate’s version is essentially the same.   We can and must work together to strengthen our nation’s healthcare system, but this bill would be a disaster for our country and would make things much worse.

President Trump promised repeatedly that no one would lose coverage under his plan.   Tens of millions are expected to lose coverage under this Trumpcare bill.   The President promised that there would be no cuts to Medicaid.   This plan tears into Medicaid in what will amount to the biggest social safety net cut in American history.   And he promised that healthcare would be available and a lot cheaper for everyone.   This bill will lead to historic drops in coverage and major increases in premiums for those who can least afford them.   Americans all over this country are desperately trying to be heard on Trumpcare, with just 17 percent supporting the House version.   I want to help this President keep his healthcare promises to the American people.   If he is willing to stand by his word, scrap this heartless and damaging plan, and come to the table to work with Members of Congress from both parties in good faith, I believe we can chart a path forward that drives down costs and increases healthcare coverage and access for every American.

James and Madeline met when James—who was dating a friend of Madeline’s—offered her a ride home from her job at the National Baseball Manufacturing Company in Schenectady,  New York.  The couple married two years later on Flag Day, June 14, 1942.  In 1944, as World War II raged on around the world, James and Madeline answered the call to serve. James left his job at General Electric to serve our country overseas. Madeline joined the war effort here at home as a nurse aid for the Red Cross.   The two wrote to each other regularly until James returned home on June 25, 1946. James returned to his job at General Electric where he worked until he retired as a Manager of Shop Operations in 1961.  In addition to their service to our country, James and Madeline volunteered with Meals On Wheels throughout their lives, stopping only after Madeline and James had turned 89 and 90, respectively. Madeline, at the age of 97, continues to volunteer for the Disabled American Veterans.   James and Madeline are the proud parents of three children, and now have five grandchildren, eleven great grandchildren and one great great grandchild!

I want to state my clear opposition to the Ozone Standards Implementation Act and support for Ms. Castor’s amendment.  While the Senate may have postponed its vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the attacks on Americans’ health continue in this committee.  This bill would delay standards to reduce ozone pollution and permanently weaken the Clean Air Act.  That is why so many public health and medical organizations have vocally opposed this bill every step of the way.  The Clean Air Act is among the most successful public health laws in our country’s history.  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented over 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 cases of heart disease, 1.7 million asthma attacks, and millions of respiratory illnesses. Many of those health benefits have been enjoyed by vulnerable populations, particularly children.  The science is not under dispute—  breathing air that contains ozone can cause serious health effects. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation, a study of young campers with moderate to severe asthma showed they were 40 percent more likely to have acute asthma episodes on high pollution summer days than on days with average pollution levels.  About 23 million people, including almost 7 million children, have asthma, which accounts for approximately 500,000 hospitalizations each year.  Asthma is the third-ranking cause of hospitalization among children under 15.  Cleaner air will make people healthier, and failing to clean up our air will ensure that more children have asthma attacks and will end up in the hospital.  Healthier people means fewer sick days, hospital visits, and premature deaths— all which lead to a more productive society.  That is why the benefits of these environmental protections vastly outweigh the costs.  In a week where some of our colleagues are even thinking about ripping healthcare away from 22 million Americans, this bill adds insult to injury.  Plain and simple, the bill before us today would undermine the Clean Air Act as a public health law.  It delays implementation of the 2015 ozone standards, extends the review cycle for all NAAQS to 10 years, and authorizes the EPA Administrator to consider technological feasibility as a secondary consideration.  Protecting public health and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive.  In fact, just the opposite.  Healthier societies allow our economy to thrive. That is why our economy has tripled while we have reduced air pollutants by 70 percent since the enactment of the Clean Air Act.  Delaying EPA’s more protective health standards will only serve to delay these Americans’ access to guaranteed clean air.  I ask my colleagues to support Ms. Castor’s amendment.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155268226361405/",NA,76,14,12,6,2,0,0,5

We celebrate more than our proud legacy of fighting and winning for the cause of democratic freedom & self-governance.   The roots of this day are even deeper than the beloved history of our greatest heroes making extraordinary sacrifices, and our gratitude to those friends & loved ones who would, have, or will give their all for love of country. ‬  Today we celebrate something magic that happens when we come together as Americans. Over hot grills, on backyard patios or corner shops or mid-city rooftop decks, around the swimming pool or at the park. Wherever we are today, we, the people, sparkling in our individuality, come together. Together we are America's towns, villages, cities, communities and states. We are imbued with spectacular differences and yet still we are one nation, indivisible.   And we have done this, in one form or another, for centuries.  No matter the challenges we face or the divisions we think exist between us, in our beliefs, our values, how we cook our food or raise our children, we are still sisters and brothers under a common banner.   O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming And the rockets red glare,  the bombs bursting in air,  gave proof through the night  That our flag was still there.   Today, the Fourth of July, we mark America's extraordinary independence. We have proven time and again that we are stronger than any moment, and we will weather this and all storms. Be good to one another. Challenge one another to be even better, to think bigger, to listen well, and to give voice to the voiceless. We can be a more perfect union if we try. And we must always try.   Thank you for your enduring faith in our nation. Have fun today, and be safe.    -pt","status",NA,NA,129,13,7,17,0,0,0,0

""policy uncertainty has the potential to destabilize the individual market generally.""  The Hill points out in its reporting that, ""Insurers have often blamed uncertainty from the Trump administration, for example on whether it will make key payments known as cost-sharing reductions, on the need to drop out or raise premiums.""  These conclusions are also consistent with repeated findings from the Congressional Budget Office.  This FACT does not mean that every market is perfect, but the #ACA has given us a strong platform on which to build and improve.

My statement & questions for witnesses in the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations today:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman – and thank you to the witnesses for their public service and for their testimony today.  Before I get to my questions, I’d be remiss if I didn’t echo my colleagues’ remarks on the devastating impact that #Trumpcare would have in the fight against the opioid epidemic.   This “mean” bill will rip hope away from people in communities across my district who depend on coverage from the ACA and Medicaid expansion to help them recover from the scourge of opioid addiction.   Medicaid is the single largest payer for behavioral health services in the country. In Rhode Island, Medicaid pays for nearly 50 percent of addiction treatment medication – in Kentucky, 44 percent – Maryland, 39 percent – and Virginia, 13 percent. The bill being considered in the Senate would cut $772 billion – 26 percent - from Medicaid over the next decade. There is no way this highly-efficient safety net program could sustain this type of funding loss and continue to provide services for all that need it.   Simply put, passing Trumpcare would be the single biggest step backwards in providing treatment for substance use and mental health services in our nation’s history.  That being said, last year, I collaborated with my friend Doctor Buschon on legislation that expanded buprenorphine prescribing privileges to Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants and I would like to gather your feedback on how this law is being implemented in your states.  - Director Boss, you mentioned in your testimony that Rhode Island is actively working to provide DATA 2000 training to interested practitioners. Have you seen significant interest from the NP and PA communities in becoming waivered practitioners?   - How have these additional classes of practitioners being able to prescribe MATs improved addiction treatment access in Rhode Island?  - Do you think a further expansion of the DATA 2000 waiver – either in higher patient caps or additional classes of practitioners prescribing – would have a positive impact on access to treatment in Rhode Island?  - For all the panelists – what barriers do you face in trying to recruit practitioners to become waivered DATA 2000 practitioners?  Director Boss, in your testimony, you note the importance of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and I couldn’t agree with you more. My home State of New York receives $111.5 million in funding from the Block Grant – funding that supports services to some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers.  In March of this year, I wrote a letter to the Appropriations Committee seeking robust funding for the Block Grant and 43 of my colleagues joined me in supporting this message, including members of this very Committee.   - Can you describe why S-A-P-T Block Grant is so important in Rhode Island?  - How do the S-A-P-T block grant and Medicaid funding work in complementary ways to provide safety net substance use services?  - Director Boss, I read with interest your work on the AnchorED and Anchor MORE programs. It seems like they are having real success in funneling people into recovery services. Do you have any long-term data on the success rates of individuals connected to services from these programs and also data on long-term Medicaid spend on those connected to AnchorED/Anchor More vs. those individuals not receiving services?  Many of you mentioned work that is ongoing in your states with regards to improving reentry into the community for incarcerated individuals struggling with addiction. As you all know, the transition back into the community can be a particularly dangerous time for individuals dealing with substance use issues as the physiological tolerance for the opioid has been lowered putting these individuals more at risk of overdose. In an attempt to smooth these care transitions back into the community, my home state of New York had examined the possibility of obtaining a waiver to secure Medicaid financing for services provided to inmates 30-days pre-release.   - To the panel - Is this an option that would be useful in your states and what other best practices could we employ to care for this vulnerable population?  I yield back the balance of my time.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155319722516405/",NA,54,8,12,4,1,0,0,0

Tonko","2017-07-13","2017-07-13 14:18:09","Making real progress on a major piece of legislation that would finally begin to shore up America's failing drinking water systems. My opening statement as our committee marks up a working draft this morning:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman for all your work on this discussion draft and for your willingness to continue working with us to ensure that this Committee can report a bipartisan bill.  Since the beginning of this Congress, this Subcommittee has been building a strong record on the need for federal action to help state and local governments to invest in our crumbling drinking water systems. We have heard about the consequences— both health and economic— of neglect and divestment.  We cannot fool ourselves into thinking local governments can do this on their own. There is a federal responsibility. This infrastructure is too important to continue to be neglected.  Over the past few weeks, we have worked together to make, in my opinion, significant progress from the original discussion draft.  First, let me say, this bill reflects compromise. It is not the bill Democrats would have written on our own. I believe the funding levels could be increased and a number of the standard setting hurdles that EPA faces could be removed.  But that is the nature of compromise. We have met halfway to get this bill on the path to being able to be supported by every— or nearly every— Member of this Committee.  I want to briefly mention a few provisions— many of which are new additions to this version and have been incorporated from the AQUA Act.  The draft authorizes the Drinking Water SRF for a total of $8 billion over fiscal years 2018 through 2022, beginning at $1.2 billion and rising to $2 billion. Again, while I would like to see higher levels, this is a big improvement over current levels.  The SRF was initially created in 1996 and has never been reauthorized, so this is long overdue. The draft also extends Buy America requirements for the length of the reauthorization.  It reauthorizes the Public Water System Supervision grant program at a 50% higher level.  It makes a number of changes to help disadvantaged communities by increasing the amount of loan subsidies states can provide to disadvantaged communities from 30 to 35 percent and extends the deadline by which the loan must be paid back from 30 to 35 years.  This deadline is extended further to 40 years for disadvantaged communities.  The bottom line is we know it is much more expensive to do emergency repairs than preventative maintenance.  Unfortunately, it is far too costly for disadvantaged communities to be proactive, so they are stuck in a cycle of fixing one emergency after another, with no option of going to the bond market.  There are a few more things we can do to improve this section even further, which will be discussed later this morning.  We know the data collected and shared with EPA are not sufficient. The draft would require the EPA to develop a plan for improving the accuracy and availability of compliance monitoring data.  Finally, it includes small amounts of funding for the Source Water Petition Program and a technology review that could help give credibility to technologies that will promote corrosion control, water loss, leak detection, and other system improvements.  While I believe there are additional things we can do to encourage more systems to adopt asset management, this draft at least recognizes the potential for more widespread, improved management practices.  It is my understanding that in addition to a number of bipartisan amendments, there will be a commitment to continue working on a number of other issues that are important to Members, including system resiliency, consumer notification, restructuring, and expanded monitoring.  Mr. Chairman, I again want to thank you for the discussion draft today. I firmly believe that if we address the issues that will be raised today before going to Full Committee, we will have a bill that we can be proud to show our constituents, mayors, and water utilities— a real effort to fix our pipes and ensure access to safe drinking water.  As I have said numerous times, every life and every job in this country depends on access to safe drinking water.  The needs are great, and the cost of inaction is even greater.  I look forward to continuing to take the necessary steps to bring us to action.  With that, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155323285956405/",NA,121,10,17,10,1,0,0,0
"reppaultonko","164036221404_10155323381716405","Paul D. Tonko","2017-07-13","2017-07-13 14:49:00","A number of amendments have been proposed to our drinking water legislation. Here's my statement on those amendments:   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you again for working with us on these and other issues.  The en bloc amendments under consideration represent a good portion of the bipartisan agreement that was reached.  This includes dropping the cross cutters section from the draft.  I am very concerned about potentially undermining federal environmental laws. An assessment by GAO is a better starting place to determine the effects of giving the EPA Administrator this type of discretion.  I appreciate the provisions included in the draft on disadvantaged communities, but I am happy to see another provision included from the AQUA Act, to create a minimum set-aside for disadvantaged communities of 6%.  This will go a long way to ensure that states are providing funding to these financially distressed systems. We said from the beginning that any credible bill had to include provisions to reduce lead in drinking water.  We know that children are incredibly vulnerable to the effects of lead. The grant program, based on a bill authored by Mr. Pallone and Mr. Rush, would help remove drinking water fountains containing lead from schools.  Sadly, a number of schools in my district have had elevated lead levels. At the very least, we must help remove this harmful infrastructure, which children are coming in direct contact with.  Finally, I want to express my strong support for expanding the scope of EPA’s needs assessment.  Many water utilities have stated their commitment to replacing lead services lines within 20 years.   Coincidentally, that covers the time period of EPA’s needs assessment.  I am concerned that many systems are underestimating their needs within the next two decades by not accounting for these replacements— or other emerging and costly expenses, such as the potential impacts of extreme weather and hydrological changes.  I want to make sure the EPA’s needs assessment reflects the reality of what systems are being expected to do.  This package reflects a real effort to address a number of concerns raised by Members and witnesses at our hearings.  And I know a number of other issues will be discussed where we have committed to working together to try to find agreement before Full Committee.  Ms. Dingell has been a leader on bringing more transparency to water quality reports, which today are barely understandable. Our constituents need to know whether their water is safe.  I think it is appropriate to ask EPA to provide a better template to get our constituents the information they need and with greater frequency.  Mr. Peters has worked on a sensible bill to get systems to more accurately review their vulnerabilities. This includes security, such as from the threat of a terrorist attack, as well as improving resiliency in the face of changing hydrologic conditions and extreme weather.  Mr. Green has discussed how we can get small and unsustainable systems to evaluate in what ways they may be able to restructure or used shared services to improve their long-term financial viability.  Finally, in my view, if we are not able to work together on standard setting issues, we should continue discussing improvements to the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule.  If we are not going to have improved federal standards, people should at least have testing done to empower states and water systems to take action on their own to ensure the safety of their drinking water.  In my backyard, in Hoosick Falls, New York, people really do not know for how long their water was unsafe. It took a private citizen to pay for testing to sound the alarm.  And sadly these types of contamination are becoming increasingly common— Newburgh, Horsham, and North Bennington are just a few of a growing number of communities dealing with PFOA (p-foa) and PFOS (p-fos).  Additional testing will make sure more systems are not left unaware of an emerging contaminant in their water.  I think we have identified a universe of shared concerns. If we are able to address these issues between now and Full Committee, I am confident we will have a bill that Members will be proud to support.  I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and with that, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155323381716405/",NA,49,15,8,8,0,0,0,0

The latest Senate Trumpcare bill cuts Medicaid by as much as a third.   Every version of Trumpcare we have seen would result in more than 20 million fewer Americans covered over the next 10 years.    And there is still no sign of a Trumpcare bill that would not break President Trump’s healthcare promises to the American people.  The President promised, quote, insurance for everybody. He said, and again I quote, “everybody’s going to be taken care of.”  Every version of Trumpcare would break that promise. Big league.   The President promised that Medicaid would not be cut under his healthcare plan.  No version of Trumpcare has been proposed that even comes close to keeping that promise.   And President Trump promised the American people a healthcare plan that would, quote, lower premiums, with, quote, much lower deductibles.   Trumpcare does the opposite, driving up premiums, deductibles and out of pocket costs, with our sickest, poorest and most vulnerable citizens paying the heaviest price.   Americans should not be forced to choose between buying groceries and paying for their healthcare. Surely, Mr. President, we are a greater nation than this.  I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155323618331405/",NA,148,46,26,17,1,0,10,5

Tonko","2017-07-17","2017-07-17 21:17:46","Speaking at the House Rules Committee against a terrible bill that undermines Clean Air Act protections for kids in school, adults at work, and all of us in the communities where we live. In 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act prevented over 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 cases of heart disease, 1.7 million asthma attacks, and millions of respiratory illnesses. Many of those health benefits have been enjoyed by vulnerable populations, particularly children. Undermining this successful law will make us sicker and drive up public health costs.   My remarks at the Rules Committee tonight:  Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and Members of the Rules Committee, thank you for allowing me to testify today on H.R. 806.  I wish I was here under different circumstances. This year the Environment Subcommittee has built a good track record of bipartisanship.  We reported a bipartisan bill out of the Full Committee to reauthorize EPA’s Brownfields program on a voice vote.  On an issue near and dear to Chairman Shimkus, we reported a nuclear waste bill by a vote of 49 to 4.  And last week, we voice voted my top priority out of our subcommittee to reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and invest in our nation’s drinking water infrastructure, which is on the path to being another bipartisan success story.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017, which was not supported by a single Democratic Member on the Committee.  The Clean Air Act has driven important progress in improving our nation’s air quality and public health.  Under the law, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards—or NAAQS—for certain pollutants that endanger public health and the environment, including ozone.  These health-based standards are the cornerstone of the Clean Air Act.  EPA sets NAAQS at levels sufficient to protect the public health. Essentially, the level of ambient air pollution that is “safe” to breathe.  While costs are not considered in establishing these standards, costs can be and are considered in developing plans to achieve the necessary pollution reductions to meet the standards.  Under the statute, EPA must review each NAAQS every five years and make revisions as appropriate.  As I have said before, H.R. 806 takes an “everything but the kitchen sink” approach to weakening the Clean Air Act.  The bill would:  • delay implementation of the 2015 ozone NAAQS by up to eight years; • extend the review period for all criteria air pollutant NAAQS, not just ozone, from every five years to every ten years; and, • change the long-standing criteria for establishing an air quality standard from one that is based solely on protecting public health to one that includes a consideration of the “technological feasibility” of the standard.  I know a number of amendments have been submitted to address some of those concerns.  When I was growing up, the public did not have a great awareness about air pollution. We just called it smog. But today, there is robust scientific and medical evidence that ozone, particulate matter, and other pollutants can have very serious health effects, particularly on vulnerable populations – like children and the elderly.  Delaying or weakening these standards goes against the growing body of scientific evidence that demonstrates that we need to continue to strengthen the standards if we want to truly protect public health.  Protecting public health and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive. In fact, just the opposite.  Healthier people will allow our economy to thrive. That is why our economy has tripled while we have reduced major air pollutants by 70 percent since the enactment of the Clean Air Act.  Healthier people means fewer sick days, hospital visits, and premature deaths— all which lead to a more productive society.  History has shown that meeting these health-protective standards is achievable.  So I cannot support the bill before us today.  It would undermine the goals of the Clean Air Act and slow down, if not roll back, the progress our nation has made on improving air quality.  Short of reporting an open rule, I urge the Committee to make all amendments submitted in order. I have submitted an amendment to remove the technological feasibility section, to ensure that EPA continues to consider only health-based factors when determining what level of pollution is safe.  Ms. Castor has submitted an amendment to halt implementation of the bill if EPA’s independent advisory panel, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, finds that it could increase health risks to vulnerable populations including children, seniors, and pregnant women.  Mr. McNerney has offered a couple of amendments that get to the real issue that is constraining state and local governments from meeting today’s standards— a lack of resources.  Section 6 of the bill actually blocks any additional funds from being used to implement this act. State and local governments rely upon federal assistance to achieve healthy air quality for their residents. Unfortunately, this prohibition, coupled with drastic proposed cuts to EPA’s budget, will only further undermine the efforts by regions with the poorest air quality as they work to meet these standards.  These are just a few of the amendments that have been submitted.  Thank you again for letting me appear before the Committee today. Once again, I would encourage you to make all Democratic amendments in order.   I am happy to answer any questions the Committee may have.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155339175296405/",NA,84,17,10,13,2,0,0,1

Tonko","2017-07-18","2017-07-18 18:39:20","Leading my colleagues in debate against the #SmoggySkiesAct, a bill that would gut Clean Air Act protections that safeguard Americans' public health & support our nation's families communities & economies.   My opening statement:  M. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to express my strong opposition to H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act, which would undermine the Clean Air Act and the decades of progress we have made to improve our nation’s public health and air quality.  This bill delays implementation of the 2015 ozone standards until 2025, extends the review cycle for all National Ambient Air Quality Standards from 5 to 10 years, and authorizes the EPA Administrator to consider technological feasibility when establishing or revising a NAAQS (pronounced “nacks”).  Today, we will hear that removing health and environmental protections creates jobs. Despite all the evidence that protecting public health and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive.  Since its enactment, the Clean Air Act has reduced key air pollutants by roughly 70 percent, while the U.S. economy has more than tripled.  We will hear today that our country has made enough progress, and we will hear claims that further progress will be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  But this bill’s supporters may not tell us that the American Lung Associations’ 2017 State of the Air report found that nearly 4 in 10 people in the United States live in counties that have unhealthful levels of either ozone or particle pollution.  Delaying EPA’s more protective health standards will only serve to delay these Americans’ access to guaranteed clean air.  I believe American ingenuity continues to be up to the task of developing and deploying technologies that will protect our citizens. History has shown again and again that meeting such basic health-protective standards is achievable. More importantly, advancing these protections will make America more productive, more competitive, will improve quality of life and drive down public health costs tied to asthma, heart disease and even cancer.  We may hear today that standards change too frequently, and EPA should have more time to review and implement each standard.  We will likely not hear that EPA has discretion on these matters and is only tasked with changing those standards if it will protect health.  Every year, more studies are completed. With each new study, we gain an even better understanding of how ozone and other pollutants are harming Americans’ health. It is critical that these standards reflect the latest available science.  What we are not likely to hear today is questioning of the large and growing body of scientific and medical evidence that breathing air that contains ozone and other criteria pollutants can cause serious health effects.  Unfortunately, this bill would cast aside that scientific evidence in favor of adding cost and technological feasibility considerations into the standard-setting process.  The proposed changes to the Clean Air Act will slow down, if not outright rollback, the progress we have made to clean our air. This would be a mistake.  Healthier people means fewer sick days, fewer hospital visits, and fewer premature deaths— all of which leads us to a more productive society.  According to a peer-reviewed 2011 EPA study, in 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act prevented over 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 cases of heart disease, 1.7 million asthma attacks, and million more respiratory illnesses. Many of those health benefits have helped our most vulnerable populations, particularly our children.  That is why so many public health and medical organizations and professionals have vocally opposed this bill every step of the way.  The Clean Air Act keeps kids in school, adults at work and on the job, and tens of thousands of Americans out of the Emergency Room every year.  At a time when Republicans in Congress have been almost singularly focused on ramming through legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, this bill adds insult to injury.  Plain and simple, the bill before us today would undermine the Clean Air Act as a safeguard of our public health law, and I encourage all Members to oppose it.  I reserve the balance of my time.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155341870021405/",NA,77,23,10,7,0,0,1,1

My statement as prepared for delivery today:  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act.  This bill is a solution in search of a problem.  We heard from FERC that 88 percent of projects are certificated within one year following a completed application.  It is clear that under the existing process, these projects are moving forward without significant delays.  We have not seen good evidence that we need to further tilt the process in favor of pipeline companies, which is what the bill before us today would do.  While I am concerned about a number of provisions in this bill, I specifically want to highlight the section that would require federal and state agencies to accept aerial survey data, such as data collected by drones, and allow these agencies to grant conditional approvals based on that data.  Aerial data have limitations and can be insufficient.  These data may not account for historic sites, endangered species, or wetlands. But under this bill, agencies would be required to consider it.  Granting conditional permits based on inadequate data will ultimately not speed up the process. But what it does instead is circumvent the rights of landowners.  We also should be more thoughtful about changing this process given the implications it can have on private landowners’ rights.  Under the law, pipeline companies are able to use eminent domain authority, allowing these corporations to take private property to build their pipelines.  This bill would further restrict the already limited opportunities private landowners and concerned citizens have to weigh-in on proposed projects.  Streamlining is fine, but we are considering expediting a process that can result in the use of eminent domain.  The bar for seizing private property should be high, and lowering that bar is to the detriment of private landowners.  Historically, when considering the use of eminent domain, the question has been, “is it in the public’s interest?” but this bill is forcing the question to shift to, “is it in the company’s interest?”  That is not acceptable to me.  If we continue to expedite and rubber stamp these projects, consumers will be on the hook for un-viable, and eventually stranded, assets.  We need to look at our energy infrastructure based on holistic, regional needs that take into account how many projects are under consideration and how it would impact existing infrastructure.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155345666261405/",NA,54,9,7,9,0,0,0,0

My opening statement:  I am coming into this hearing without many predetermined conclusions. I do not have major corn or oil interests in my district, so I appreciate all our witnesses taking the time to better educate us today.  I do have a few simple principles when it comes to biofuels.  First, we need to take immediate and decisive actions to combat climate change. And we need to be looking at how investment in biofuels R&D can impact greenhouse gas emissions.  Second, regardless of the blend of our liquid fuels, our vehicles should use those fuels as efficiently as possible. Changing the amount of biofuels we use in fuel is not an excuse to duck responsibility on vehicle fuel efficiency standards.  Finally, we must continue to electrify the transportation sector. This change is necessary and probably inevitable. We are still decades away from that becoming a widespread reality, but it’s coming.  But even with greater electrification, our aircraft, ships, and possibly heavy trucks, will still need liquid fuels. We must continue to develop a domestic advanced biofuels industry.   I understand the industry has not developed as predicted, but Congress should not undercut or disincentivize that industry’s future development.  I also remain concerned about major cuts that the Trump Administration has proposed, especially how these cuts will affect the world class research happening at our national labs.   No matter our individual thoughts on this specific issue, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come together to agree that as a nation we must invest in research. To not do so would be costly in terms of innovation, job growth and our future workforce.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155366000021405/",NA,57,6,8,1,1,1,0,1

That puts us just a few big partisan votes away from sending a bill to the President's desk that would give as much as a $7 million yearly tax break to the 400 richest families in America, and pay for it by ripping healthcare from 20 to 30 MILLION of our loved ones, friends and neighbors. Those who will suffer are parents and grandparents in nursing homes, veterans in need of care and treatment, our poorest children and many of the most vulnerable members of our community.   President Trump promised a healthcare plan that would not cut Medicaid. He promised that everyone would be covered under his plan. Every version of #Trumpcare introduced so far would break those promises.   That's why I am speaking LIVE from the floor of the House of Representatives tonight.   These are your stories, the stories of my constituents whose lives were made better thanks to the ACA. I hope you will tune in during and after my statements tonight. We need to put a human face, and a human voice, on this issue.   For every healthcare story you hear, I am asking you to imagine a thousand other Americans huddled together with stories just like it. Imagine one thousand huddled masses that same size, many whose lives have been saved, many more with friends and loved ones who were spared the pain of suffering with them. One thousand-thousand healthcare voices. One million people whose lives are better because we still believe that the American Dream does not leave people behind.   All of those million, and at least 20 million more, would lose access to their healthcare under ANY version of #Trumpcare.  Time for a show of strength. Time to speak up.

My AQUA Act has been incorporated into a major bipartisan effort, H.R. 3387, to shore up these mostly invisible systems that have a powerful impact on our families, our public health & safety, and our local & national economies. As I have said many times before, every life and every job depends on access to safe, clean drinking water.   Our bill is being reviewed by the full Energy & Commerce committee this morning. If it passes here, it moves on to a vote by the whole House. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their productive engagement and for sharing their best ideas to make this the best possible legislation for the American people.   This is my opening statement:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today marks a great step toward guaranteeing the safe drinking water that our constituents expect and deserve.  Unfortunately, far too often drinking water isn’t safe, affordable, or reliable.  This is unacceptable. Every modern society depends on clean water.  Americans deserve better, but the reality is our local governments are often unable to do the preventative work necessary to make our water systems sustainable.  Crumbling pipes pose a serious risk to public health and safety.  And the federal share of spending on water systems has trended downward for decades.  Since passage of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments, federal funding for our drinking water infrastructure has been flat while the needs have continued to grow.  The Drinking Water System Improvement Act will go a long way to addressing these shortfalls.  The Environment Subcommittee has done good work this year to build the record on the need for this legislation.  So I want to thank Mr. Harper, Chairman Walden, and Chairman Shimkus for all their work on this issue and willingness to accept a significant number of Democratic provisions into this bill.  Drinking water infrastructure is too important to our health and our economy to continue to ignore. I look forward to continue working across the aisle to advance this effort.  I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155372958406405/",NA,67,11,8,12,1,1,0,0

Tonko","2017-07-27","2017-07-27 17:15:53","Speaking out in the House Energy & Commerce Committee in support of our bipartisan bill to repair and improve America's failing drinking water systems. My statement introducing the bill:  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you, Chairman Shimkus, Mr. Harper, and your staff for working with us on a number of issues to help get us to this point.  The Environment Subcommittee has heard in great detail about the health and economic consequences of our nation’s failing drinking water systems.  Every day there are hundreds of water main breaks and billions of gallons of water lost through leaks.  It is clear that our systems are in dire need of additional investment.  This bill reflects a good compromise. It is not the bill Democrats would have written on our own. But it represents a real commitment to addressing this very serious issue and a significant improvement over the original discussion draft from our legislative hearing in May.  I commend the Majority for a number of provisions in the bill.  The underlying bill would reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for a total of $8 billion over five years.  It would reauthorize the Public Water System Supervision grant program at a 50% higher level, make a number of improvements to help disadvantaged communities, promote better asset management practices, and provide funding for the Source Water Petition Program.  These are all good changes that I fully support, and I appreciate the Majority’s commitment to these issues. Speaking out in the House Energy & Commerce Committee in support of our bipartisan bill to repair and improve America's failing drinking water systems. My  This bill:  • Extends Buy America requirements for the length of the reauthorization and puts prevailing wage requirements into the Safe Drinking Water Act statute;  • Creates a minimum set-aside for disadvantaged communities of 6%;  • Seeks to improve the accuracy and availability of compliance data submitted by water systems to States and from States to EPA;  • Allows the use of SRF funds for siting, preconstruction activities, and replacing or rehabilitating aging treatment, storage, or distribution facilities;  • Authorizes EPA to collect information related to streamlining and aiding the Drinking Water SRF application process, spending of SRF funds, and types of assistance granted; and,  • Provides funding for EPA to review existing and potential methods, equipment, and other smart-technology to prevent and detect leakage, contamination, and other problems facing water systems.  These are all identical or very similar to provisions included in the Democratic AQUA Act.  Furthermore, other Democratic bills have been incorporated, based on our agreement at our Subcommittee markup, either in the underlying bill or in this Manager’s amendment.  The bill creates a grant program, based on a bill authored by Mr. Pallone and Mr. Rush, to remove drinking water fountains containing lead from schools.  Also related to lead, the bill requires future EPA needs assessment to include the cost of replacing lead services lines, which I believe is a critical change to tackle the removal of lead components within our systems.  Based on Mr. Peters’s Secure and Resilient Water Systems Act, systems would be required to do assessments of their vulnerabilities to security threats and natural hazards, such as hydrological changes. Language based on Ms. Dingell’s bill to required improved consumer confidence reports on a more regular basis has been included in the underlying bill.  And language similar to Mr. Pallone’s SDWA (“sid-wah”) Amendments of 2017 would address restructuring and require systems that frequently violate SDWA to assess their options for a more sustainable future.  Finally, I want to thank the Chairmen for working with us to expand EPA’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule.  The Manager’s Amendment would expand the requirement to test for these contaminants for all medium-sized systems, defined as 3,300 to 10,000 people served.  Systems larger than 10,000 are already required to test for these contaminants.  This would mean that thousands of communities— communities like Hoosick Falls, New York, and similarly sized systems— would no longer have emerging contaminants go undetected, threatening the health of their residents, potentially for years.  Short of creating more national standards, having communities test for emerging contaminants will empower them to take action to mitigate serious health threats that they may not have known existed otherwise. Nearly 30 million people will now additionally be captured by the UCMR.  So I am very grateful for your willingness to work with us to address the concerns of people dealing with PFOA and other emerging contaminants.  Mr. Chairman, I will just wrap up by saying we have produced a bill that we can be proud of. It will make a difference. It will put us on a path to end the decades of neglect of our water systems. I encourage Members to adopt this amendment and support the bill.  With that, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155373401776405/",NA,35,7,8,3,2,1,0,0

Yes, America's founders enslaved people. That hard truth calls on us to fight for social justice with heart and conviction, not hide behind fake moral equivalency. No, Mr. President, statues celebrating America's founders are not the same as statues carrying the banner of the Confederacy and symbolizing hate.   We needed this to be a moment of healing and unity, of responding together against hate and of working together to mend the deep racial and cultural wounds that remain open and raw from centuries of denial and inhumanity. We have a duty to confront our painful legacy of racism, oppression and violence, especially where it is so openly on display.  Instead, our President has made #Charlottesville an excuse to silence peaceful anti-hate activism, even after some of those activists were brutally attacked and Heather Heyer was killed. That violence is being distorted in ways that lend legitimacy to a racist mob chanting Nazi and white nationalist slogans and displaying swastika and Confederate flags. This is inexcusable.

Militarizing our police departments is a different question.   To quote a former Seattle Police Chief, ""The police are not at war, and Americans are not the enemy.""  We do ourselves, our community, and the local police officers and departments who serve us a disservice when we cast them as instruments of war instead of as officers of the peace.   And at the same time we continue to fail at providing the support that has actually proven to keep officers & communities safe:  - adequate funding for open houses and other community outreach events,  - advanced training in deescalation,  - letting officers serve dedicated neighborhoods so they can get to know people on a first-name basis, and - other proven community policing techniques that actually do reduce crime, violence and improve law and order.  That's what 21st century policing should be about: safe families, safe communities and safe officers.

Dr. King's dream, a daring vision of a racially awake America, remains a guide for all who strive to make ours a more perfect union. Yet, more than a half century later, events like the white supremacist march in Charlottesville and similar demonstrations of hate around the country make that dream seem like it is drifting further and further out of reach.   If you share some part of King's dream, let this anniversary be the start of a new chapter for yourself and those close to you, a new call to action for Americans of good conscience, a reminder that without struggle there is no progress (h/t Frederick Douglass).   If you see references to race or racism in your Facebook feed or in your daily lives from people who don't look like you, or who live very different lives than you do, don't dismiss them. Give yourself time to process, give the ideas your care and keep your best open mind. Most importantly, give your neighbors, friends and family members the benefit of the doubt. Remember that there is always more that unites us than divides us.  We are going through a difficult and painful moment and the answers aren't always going to be on the surface. After all, King's vision was not of a colorblind nation but of a brilliantly colorful one. And we won't get there just by winning arguments or even elections. We can only hope to get there with heart and patience and lots and lots of listening.","video","https://youtu.be/3vDWWy4CMhE",NA,129,13,21,22,0,0,0,3

Tonko","2017-09-05","2017-09-05 14:35:50","For those unable to attend, I wanted to share my prepared remarks for our #LaborDay rally in Albany yesterday:  Labor Day is a holiday at the heart of America’s character. It was meant to enshrine our values as a nation, a people that support our workers.    My heart tells me that our nation has forgotten some of the essential lessons this day was meant to celebrate.   Americans work a lot. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), we work on average 137 more hours per year than Japanese workers, 260 more hours per year than British workers, and almost 500 more hours per year than French workers.     The promise of the labor movement was not just that America’s working parents could bring home a fair wage for a full day’s work. It was also that the gains of automation, of new advances that made America more productive, would lift our workers and not just those who employ them.   Instead, the wealthiest of the wealthiest, the wealthiest 1 percent OF the top 1 percent, have managed to soak up every spare cent of profit as our economy has become more automated. Meanwhile, workers are working longer hours, each worker’s productivity is up some 400% since 1950, but when it comes to making real economic gains, workers are being left behind.   Today, we live in a country where the wealthiest 1% possess 40% of all of our nation’s wealth, and the folks in the bottom 80% income bracket own just 7%.   Think about that for a moment. That great chasm between the investor class and the working class is often invisible. We don’t see the ultra-wealthy at the grocery store or during our daily commutes. They might as well live in a completely different country from the rest of us.   And things are getting worse. Several recent studies have shown that, since about 1980, the real income of the average working American family, accounting for inflation and all other costs, has been flat. In other words, the American worker hasn’t gotten a real raise since Ronald Reagan became president. Meanwhile, the income of the wealthiest 0.01% is around seven times what it was back then.    This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy, and it’s all happening on the backs of America’s working families. It’s what Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were all talking about in the 2016 election. But nobody is doing anything about it now.    I don’t want to make this too political. I really don’t. But I need to say this because this is Labor Day, this is why we celebrate this day as a national holiday.   One of the President’s first acts in office was to roll back a policy that gave working families with a home mortgage a break on their payments.    His healthcare bill would have thrown us back to a healthcare system that denied working families coverage for pre-existing conditions like “did you have acne as a kid”, “are you a woman of child-bearing age”, “have you ever had cancer.”    A healthcare system that condemned the sick and the unfortunate to lifetimes of crushing debt and often bankruptcy.    His bill would have slashed heartlessly at Medicaid, a program that covers half of all U.S. births and three quarters of America’s poorest children.    So much for family values.    And why? This is important, we need to ask that. Because he wanted to cut taxes for extremely wealthy families and for corporations. Trumpcare was a wealthcare bill.    I could go on and on, talking about his budget proposals that slash away at services for working families, for seniors, for children, for cutting-edge health research that would help protect our communities from Zika, combat heart disease and bring us forward in the cancer fight.    Programs that educate our kids earlier in their lives when that education makes the most difference. Programs that help people find and train for new jobs, that keep us out of wars and out of harm’s way.    None of those cuts will un-rig this economy. In fact they will do the opposite.    I believe the job of elected representatives, in an economy like this one, is to work toward improving the standard of living for all of our workers.   That starts with raising wages. And there are only two ways for workers to win higher pay—increasing the minimum wage and building strong unions.    In New York we know how important it is to have strong unions and pay workers a wage they can live on. That’s why we fought to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.    But in Washington and across the country, it’s too often the opposite. Congress hasn’t raised the federal minimum wage in eight years, and in many states, elected officials work hand-in-hand with big corporations to make sure that all the money goes to the rich folks, instead of to workers. They’re doing everything they can to keep wages low and gut union rights.    And here’s another shocking fact about our economy: nearly half of the U.S. workforce, some 64 million Americans, are paid less than $15 an hour today.    That’s not just a problem for workers. When so many millions of Americans are paid so little, barely enough to survive, we all pay the price. Those low wages end up costing taxpayers $150 billion every year in the form of needed public assistance for working families.     Our only shot at re-balancing the economy is to raise wages and to work to restore the strength and positive influence of our unions once more.   America needs its labor unions. They are on the front lines of every fight for workers’ rights, for safe working conditions and for the fair wages we need to re-balance this economy.   The workers in the jobs that dominate our state today – workers in hospitals, in healthcare, and the service sector – they need unions. I’m talking about strong organizations of workers with the bargaining power to make sure everyone sees their fair share of the profits.    Stronger unions will raise the wage floor and boost purchasing power for working people in every community, which will lead to more growth and a rising standard of living.    The fast food workers here today represent the bookends – the top and the bottom of the economic ladder -- within the service economy. We need these jobs to be good jobs, where people can pay for their basic needs and support a family.    I’m committed to standing with the Fight for $15, SEIU and all working people to make it easier for workers everywhere to join unions and bargain collectively for fair wages and fair treatment on the job. We need a strong economic agenda that ensures all Americans – not just the wealthy and powerful – have a voice again, and do well again.","link","http://wnyt.com/news/labor-day-rally-significance/4594341/?cat=10114","nyt.com",68,21,2,1,0,0,0,1

Tonko","2017-09-06","2017-09-06 21:14:36","I spoke out this morning on the importance of fully staffing and equipping the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to perform its critical work protecting the health and safety of the American people.   Here are my remarks as prepared for delivery:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I want to express my deepest condolences to our fellow Americans that are suffering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.  EPA has an important role to play in disaster response and recovery – ensuring the environmental monitoring and remediation needed to protect public health. But that can only be done if EPA has the resources and personnel to do so.  This weekend the EPA released statements highlighting just some of the work they will need to do in the days, weeks, and months ahead: - Assessing 13 existing Superfund sites that were flooded and could be damaged; - Addressing the many drinking and waste water systems that remain shut down or damaged or are dealing with health advisories; - Assisting with testing for private wells; and, - Supporting local first responders with monitoring and cleanup following chemical fires at the Arkema Facility in Crosby, Texas.  The need for a strong, robust EPA is clear. And massive budget and workforce cuts, and proposals to weaken, understaff, or even eliminate regional offices, are not the answer.  So thank you, Mr. Gomez and Mr. Larsen for being here this morning. The recommendations proposed by GAO and the IG’s Office can continue to make EPA a more efficient and successful agency.  Sadly, the Trump Administration is aggressively working to dismantle the EPA through regulatory rollbacks, extreme budget cuts and staff eliminations, and an ongoing assault on science.  Mr. Gomez, GAO released a report on EPA, Interior, and Forest Service workforce planning in March 2010 which concluded that agencies’ efforts have “particularly fallen short in” aligning the agencies’ workforce plans with their strategic plans.  The report concludes that agencies are at risk of not having the appropriately skilled workforce they need to effectively achieve their missions.  - Are you generally familiar with that report?  - Mr. Gomez, EPA has taken some action, but further actions with respect to workforce planning are still outstanding, correct?  The Trump Administration proposed cutting funding to the agency by nearly $2.6 billion—a 31% reduction. And proposed reducing the workforce by 3,800 employees. Nearly 50 programs to protect our air and water, address climate change, and strengthen chemical safety were highlighted for elimination.  This included the Chemical Safety Board, the independent federal agency tasked with investigating chemical accidents, such as the recent fires at the Arkema chemical plant in Crosby, Texas.  - Mr. Gomez, in your testimony today, you note that the March 2010 report found that “the ability of federal agencies to achieve their mission and carry out their responsibilities depends in large part on whether they can sustain a workforce that possesses the necessary education, knowledge, skills, and other competencies,” is that correct?  Thank you. Mr. Chairman. We should all be concerned how extreme budget and staffing reductions will undermine EPA’s ability to accomplish its mission, especially in the face of disasters. Thank you, and I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155487932626405/",NA,187,44,19,17,2,1,0,1

Individuals in the 50 to 64 age bracket often face significantly higher premiums during that period of their lives. Opening the door to Medicare would help them avoid that increase. Even better, under this legislation employers would continue to be able to make pre-tax contributions to help cover premiums, a financial win for employers and employees alike.

Here are my remarks as prepared for delivery:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today’s legislative hearing will focus on four bills that seek to amend, and in my opinion, weaken, the Clean Air Act.  But first, I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here today. I certainly appreciate hearing the perspectives from small businesses that are responsible for implementing these EPA rules.  I also want to thank Dr. Bascom for being here on behalf of the American Thoracic Society. It is equally important that we hear about the medical and public health effects of delaying Clean Air Act rules.  Finally, I am happy to welcome back Ms. Alexandra Teitz, who served as Senior Counsel to this Committee for many years and is testifying on behalf of the Sierra Club.  The first two bills— the BRICK Act and the SENSE Act—  were considered by the Committee in the 114th Congress. Once again, I doubt the likelihood of either becoming law in the 115th.  I would recommend that instead we use our limited time to continue to build upon our bipartisan record of success.  H.R. 1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns, or BRICK, Act, would delay implementation of EPA’s Brick and Structural Clay Products rule until all legal challenges are resolved.  Not only does this incentivize frivolous litigation to delay compliance, it creates a bad precedent that could be applied to other standards. Personally, I believe this can more effectively be resolved by the courts.  H.R. 1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, or SENSE Act, would revise EPA’s Cross State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR and Mercury and Air Toxics rule, or MATS, to allow power plants that burn waste coal to emit higher levels of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride.  New York has seen the benefits of the Clean Air Act’s good neighbor provision. I saw the damage caused by acid rain, particularly near my district in the #Adirondacks, and much of it was due to out-of-state pollution.  CSAPR requires certain states to reduce their annual emissions of sulfur dioxide. This rule has been extremely effective– preventing tens of thousands of premature deaths and hospitalizations, and millions of missed days of work or school each year.  CSAPR uses a phased-in approach to achieve emissions reductions, where emissions allowances decrease over time.  But the SENSE Act would hold allowances for waste coal constant.  It is worth noting that states already have the ability to create their own implementation plans, which could include shifting allowances. This bill will impede on states’ rights to determine the best path for reducing emissions.  Ultimately, I do not believe we should be giving any fuel source special treatment on reducing air pollution, especially when other power plants are expected to meet similar requirements.  H.R. 453, the Relief from New Source Performance Standards Act of 2017, would delay the Step Two compliance date by three years for three categories of wood-fueled heaters.  I would note that there are companies already compliant with EPA’s 2020 standard.  Finally, H.R. 350, the Recognizing the Protection of Motorsports Act of 2017, would exempt motor vehicles used solely for competition from penalties for altering a vehicle that results in increased emission of air pollutants.  I am concerned how broadly this bill is written. It would create a loophole that would make it even more difficult for EPA to regulate manufacturers that produce emissions control defeat devices for vehicles. Ultimately, delaying or undermining rules that seek to reduce hazardous air pollutants is not good for Americans.  The scientific, medical, and public health communities have ample evidence that polluted air is a threat to our health, particularly for vulnerable populations.  We also know that pollution can be a tremendous drag on our economy and productivity— causing respiratory illnesses, costly hospitalizations, missed school and work days, and even premature deaths.  The Clean Air Act has been about making progress over time. The longer we delay new standards, the longer our constituents are forced to live with unhealthy levels of air pollution.  Our country can do better than the status quo, and in recent years, the EPA has worked hard to develop protections that will continue the decades-long trend of improving our nation’s air quality.  So I want to reiterate my initial concerns with the bills before us today.  I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155505571991405/",NA,53,15,6,7,0,0,0,0

Here we go again, another round of tax cuts for the ultra-rich and corporations. The tax fantasy that Republicans in Washington published this week would give generously to the wealthiest Americans, exploding the deficit at the expense of middle class and working families.   The cost of war and a $2.3 trillion price tag on the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy have drained our treasury. Instead of spending trillions of dollars more on handouts for people who don’t need them, we should be focused on strengthening our middle class and small business community, repairing and improving our roads, bridges, railways, water systems and other critical infrastructure, and delivering life-saving assistance to the countless Americans whose lives are in shambles after recent historic hurricanes.   The President and his rich cabinet are still clinging to the well-worn and widely-debunked fiction of “trickle down” economics that has driven the Republican agenda for 30 years, a failed idea that former President George H. W. Bush himself called voodoo economics. Their tax outline shows the President and Congressional leaders are back to pushing those same old rigged economic policies that have left American workers without a meaningful raise in three decades.   Undeterred after their attempt to dismantle our health care, Republicans are continuing their assault on New Yorkers and plan to inflict even more pain by eliminating the state and local tax deduction, a deduction that protects Capital Region families that are already dealing with high property taxes. Our local working families should not be asked to shoulder a greater burden just to give another round of tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.

We mourn the lost and pray for all fighting to recover.  We should not have to live in fear of mass shootings in America, but that is the sad reality lived by millions of Americans every day including parents who send a kid off to elementary school or drop their teenager off at a concert.   We still do not know the full facts of the tragedy in Las Vegas but we have seen this pattern play out too many times already and we know attacks like it will continue until we do something to stop them. Congress has had many, many opportunities to take up commonsense firearm reform, hundreds of devastating attacks from Columbine to Sandy Hook, and has repeatedly failed to adopt any meaningful protections. That must change.  Time and again this year, you have shown that your voices are powerful. If you continue to speak out on this issue, to make this an issue for every Member of Congress, it will be a great help to those of us who have long fought for real, reasonable reforms that help keep our communities and our families safe.   Most importantly, please do not lose heart. If we remain steadfast, we can, and in time I have faith that we will, prevail.   UPDATE: I have signed on to co-sponsor H.Res 367, a bill to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention. We have a terrible gun violence problem in this country. Special interest groups have made it nearly impossible for us to move forward but Congress needs to act.   A select committee may feel like too little, and for the thousands of gun violence victims this year and the many thousands in years past it is entirely too late. But it is a start. We will need every resource we can muster to beat back the flood of special interest money that helps so many of our opponents in Congress block our efforts every single time we try to act on sensible firearm protections.   In the meantime, I continue to push for every one of the many commonsense measures that I have supported in the past, and I am grateful to have the strength of your voices and your passion to propel this movement forward.","status",NA,NA,204,60,15,13,0,0,80,4

My introductory remarks and questions as prepared for delivery:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for being here today.  This hearing was rescheduled due to the recent natural disasters. In light of those disasters. I believe it is an appropriate time for this Committee to consider how to strengthen our grid.  I would hope as we invest in the comeback  for all the states that have been impacted by these natural disasters and also areas like Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and the various territories I would hope that we build a grid of the future. We've learned many lessons from mother nature.   Following the devastation from major disasters, people begin to think and plan for all possibilities. In New York, the REV initiative born by the New York State Public Service Commission came in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy.  That disaster showed the value of distributed generation, and encouraged the state to invest in microgrid R&D and consider barriers to deployment.  QUESTIONS  ·       Dr. Dillingham, you mention microgrids paired with combined heat and power systems. Can you describe the value these systems add to the grid?  ·       How important is federal funding for the development of these systems?  The National Academies of Sciences July report on resiliency suggested that distributed energy resources “may help avoid or defer the need for new generation, transmission, or distribution infrastructure to address congestion, localized reliability, or resilience issues.”  ·       Dr. Sanders, if integrated properly, can distributed generation contribute to making a resource generation mix more resilient?  ·       And is this also true for other distributed resources, which have been supported by DOE R&D investments, such as storage and microgrids?  And it is not just generation issues, many outages are caused by problems with the transmission and distribution infrastructure.  ·       Dr. Dillingham, do you agree that other types of grid infrastructure hardening are important for improving resiliency?  I fully recognize that there is no magic switch to make our grid more resilient. But I think it is clear that certain advanced energy technologies and existing distributed resources can reinforce grid resilience during extreme weather events— in addition to promoting greater reliability and flexibility.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in response and recovery efforts. And sadly, disasters of this magnitude are becoming far too common.   If we continue business as usual, systems will become only more vulnerable.  This is not a choice between pay now or pay later. It is pay now— by supporting research, hardening our infrastructure, and making meaningful investments to adapt to and mitigate climate change— or pay now in multi-billion dollar emergency spending packages.   The fiscally sensible approach is to acknowledge the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather and to make the necessary investments to mitigate and adapt to it. And with that, I yield back.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155557969881405/",NA,52,18,9,1,2,0,0,0

But that’s exactly what President #Trump’s anti-birth control #contraception rule would do.  To be clear, this will let virtually anyone (bosses, health plans, schools, etc.) discriminate against women by refusing to cover birth control.  Since his first day in office, this President, White House & GOP-controlled Congress have relentlessly attacked women’s #reprorights & access to care.  Today’s action is no different.

This decision will result in more carbon pollution from existing power plants and tremendous public health, economic, and environmental harm. As a reminder, the CPP was expected to prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths annually between 2015 and 2030. Those health benefits will be lost if the Clean Power Plan is repealed.  Administrator Pruitt has spent his career suing the EPA to block public health safeguards while accepting political contributions from special interests. Under his leadership, the EPA has all but banned use of the term “climate change.” Unfortunately the scientific consensus is clear: the climate is changing. The first 16 years in the 21st century rank among the 17 warmest on record. The effects are already being felt— longer and more severe droughts, more intense natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods, and rising sea levels. These disasters are taking people’s lives and costing our economy billions of dollars annually, and the risks will only get worse in the future.  Other nations are already seizing economic opportunities to transition to a low-carbon economy and are rushing forward to displace the United States as the global leaders in clean energy jobs and innovations. The longer we wait to transition to a climate economy, the less competitive we will be. The overwhelming scientific consensus cannot be ignored, and we will continue to be at risk to the growing threat of climate change unless we take bold action, including reducing carbon pollution from the power sector. The Trump Administration must drop this proposal immediately.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/climate/clean-power-plan.html","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/climate/clean-power-plan.html","nytimes.com",23,25,18,1,1,0,11,55

My full remarks as prepared for delivery:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are a nation in crisis. The opioid epidemic is wreaking havoc in our communities at an unprecedented scale, with the CDC estimating 64,000 dead from drug overdoses in 2016, an astonishing 21 percent increase from the previous year.  This public health disaster is costing us more lives annually than at the peak of the AIDS epidemic – as many lives as gun violence and traffic accidents combined.   If this Congress doesn’t find additional solutions to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic, we will be complicit in this American tragedy.  I’m here today to offer two such legislative solutions.  First, I introduced the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act, H.R. 3692, with my good friend Congressman Ben Ray Lujan. This legislation would expand access to medication-assisted treatment by allowing certified nurse midwives and other advanced practice registered nurses to prescribe buprenorphine. In addition, this legislation would codify the 2016 rule that allowed physicians to treat up to 275 patients with buprenorphine and eliminate the sunset of a provision that allows non-physician providers to prescribe MAT.  The Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act would particularly benefit pregnant and postpartum women who are struggling with addiction and improve outcomes for the over 13,000 infants that are born each year with neonatal abstinence syndrome.   Despite the expansion of medication-assisted treatment in Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, there is still a significant shortage in treatment capacity, resulting in individuals waiting months or years to receive effective addiction treatment. Only 20 percent of patients who need treatment for opioid use disorder are currently receive it.   The Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act would address this treatment gap and save lives. This committee should act on this bipartisan legislation without delay.  The second bill I’d like to discuss is the Medicaid Reentry Act, H.R. 4005. This legislation is a targeted attempt to address the problem of overdose deaths that occur post-incarceration.   Studies have shown that individuals who are released back into the community post-incarceration are roughly 8 times more likely to die of an overdose in the first two weeks post-release compared to other times. The risk of overdose is elevated during this period due to reduced physiological tolerance for opioids among the incarcerated population, a lack of effective addiction treatment options while incarcerated and poor care transitions back into the community.   The Medicaid Reentry Act would grant states flexibility to restart Medicaid coverage for Medicaid-eligible individuals 30-days pre-release. By allowing Medicaid benefits to restart prior to release, states would be able to more readily provide effective addiction treatment pre-release and would allow for smoother transitions to community care, reducing the risk of overdose deaths post-release – striking an overall wiser use of scarce Medicaid dollars.  Let me be clear, this legislation would not expand Medicaid eligibility in any way, it would simply grant states new flexibility to restart an individual’s Medicaid benefits 30-days earlier than allowed under current law. This increased flexibility would dovetail with innovative reentry programs already being championed by Republicans and Democrats in states across the country and would give individuals reentering society a fighting chance to live a healthier, drug-free life.  Let me just end with an urgent plea for action and bipartisanship. I know that many of the ideas that this committee will hear today would, in normal times, be met with the typical partisan objections and end up stuck in a procedural morass.   These are not normal times. When your house is on fire, you don’t look to see whether the firemen are wearing red or blue uniforms before they turn the hoses on.   If we are truly going to make a difference in this crisis and save lives we have to have a big heart and an open mind.    I thank my colleagues for their time and for their consideration of the legislation I have presented.","link","https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4685519%2Frep-paul-tonko-testifies-opioid-hearing","c-span.org",68,15,7,0,0,0,0,0

My full remarks are below:   Thank you.   Reauthorizing the SBIR/STTR program is critical to supporting our nation’s most forward-thinking entrepreneurs and innovators. I am relieved that we are preserving the critical parts of the program and continuing to improve upon the program.   This program has proven to be one of the most successful federal programs for technological innovation in U.S. history, delivering more than 70,000 patents and valuable innovations in agriculture, defense, energy, health sciences, homeland security, space, transportation, and other fields.   Through Phase I and Phase II SBIR, countless jobs have been created in the Capital Region of New York. It is through programs such as SBIR that our region has developed the underpinnings of support for a boom in high technology innovation and economic development.   One of many examples of this is Ecovative Design located within my Congressional District in Green Island, NY which has benefitted from the SBIR program over a number of years. These efforts will allow the company to continue their work on a replacement for engineered wood resins that will be economically competitive and non-toxic.   The resin system represents cost and energy savings and is capable of leveraging existing manufacturing equipment in production today. This funding will help them deliver on the promise of this innovative technology.  Gavin McIntyre, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at Ecovative said “we’re very excited to bring our new material technology to market and displace toxic formaldehyde based resins. The SBIR/STTR program was fundamental to how Ecovative got it’s start and has enabled us to continue to take risks and develop game-changing technology.”   While this bill is a positive step forward towards helping more small businesses, we must do more to help other small businesses develop these types of game-changing technologies.   I recognize the value of research and will fight to see more funding for all these agencies and in turn more funding for the SBIR/STTR programs.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155579594541405/",NA,69,13,5,4,1,0,0,0

Our founders called America a grand experiment, dependent on informed citizens making our voices heard. But our right to vote has long been the subject of extraordinary conflict, born in prejudice & violence on the basis of class, race and gender.  When America was founded, only White property-owning men could vote. It took 52 years for non-property-owning White men to get that right.   It took nearly a century for Black men to have the right to vote (1870), and many Southern states & local governments still worked to keep them from voting.   Women have only had the right to vote in America since 1920, a fundamental American right kept from them for almost 150 years.  Prejudice & oppression run deep through our nation’s history, but in voting we see the long arc of that history bending toward justice.   Let us not take for granted the blood spilled, lives dedicated, voices refusing to be silent that brought our grand experiment forward, nor let us rest on a false conclusion that the need & urgency of our push for progress is any less today.   Women, workers, people of color, LGBT Americans all still fight for equal representation, rights & opportunities. Our men & women in uniform still fight to keep us free. And ALL fight in faith that America is forever becoming a more just, more open, more representative, more perfect union.  There are many ways to honor this country, its unique history and the extraordinary & timeless sacrifices of its people. Somewhere near the top of that list is exercising our Constitutional right to vote.  Please join me today in exercising the right to #vote. History has proven, time and again: our vote matters & must never be taken for granted.   #ElectionDay","link","https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/","voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us",44,9,7,7,0,0,0,0

This bill tears away at protections for Americans with student loans and Americans who choose to adopt children. It strips support for individuals with unexpected health challenges, even those whose homes have burned down.  Under this plan, some 8 million American families will see their taxes go up almost immediately.  And millions more will face tax increases in the future.   All this is done while giving permanent tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars.   This puts America’s social safety net and our economic future in jeopardy. This is not the type of tax relief the American middle class and working poor need right now.

At a time when many of us are feeling exhausted by constant political and cultural fighting, our veterans give us hope and strength.   Dignity, service, sacrifice, leadership, fidelity, family, honor, loyalty and dedication. America’s veterans show us the best of ourselves and our shared values. They remind us that when each of us, all of us, commit to serve one other and to better the lives of others in our communities – we are indeed a more perfect Union.   Most importantly, our veterans are part of us. They are our brothers and sisters, our parents and grandparents, our uncles and cousins and friends and barbers and nurses and policemen and teachers.   Veterans Day is a day for us to recognize service and sacrifice, but also to redouble our commitment to the veterans in our lives and our Capital Region communities.   Our veterans deserve access to convenient, quality, safe care throughout their lives. They should never be left without hope or opportunity, or allowed to fall through the cracks with visible or invisible wounds that were left untreated or unresolved.   They deserve the kind of support that gives them a path to economic opportunity, whether starting a small business or receiving skills training.   And they deserve to know that they are honored and appreciated, something we do with Purple Heart events, VFW celebrations, and especially with our national observance and reflection on Veterans Day.   If you or someone you know is a veteran in crisis, you can get free confidential support by calling the Veterans Crisis Line at 1 800 273 8255 or send a text message to 838 255.   And if you could use a hand with your VA benefits or any other federal programs, please contact my office at 518-465-0700 or at Tonko.house.gov.  Our veterans have given us their best and they deserve our best in return. I encourage you to find some time this Veterans Day to reflect on how our nation’s veterans have touched your life, near or far, and what big or small things each of us can do to return the favor.  Thank you for watching, and to those of you who have served our nation in uniform, thank you for your service.  #VeteransDay","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155653791541405/",NA,67,3,15,12,0,0,0,0

I could not be more gratified that her outspoken statements against sexual harassment, misconduct and assault have inspired Leeann Tweeden and others to tell their stories of mistreatment at the hands of Senator Franken. There is no excuse for this kind of behavior and I support the Senate Ethics Committee decision to investigate the matter. It is important that Senator Franken has agreed to cooperate fully.   There is no doubt that we are going through a profound and painful moment of candor on the issue of sexual misconduct and sexual violence. It is my great hope that the accountability now confronting this growing list of powerful men will make it safer and easier for past and present victims to report these abuses, and will help prevent more women and men from being abused, harassed or otherwise victimized in the future.","status",NA,NA,80,19,3,4,0,0,0,0

Here's what Senator Marco Rubio said in a speech to financial sector lobbyists in Washington, DC yesterday: “Many argue that you can’t cut taxes because it will drive up the deficit. But we have to do two things. We have to generate economic growth which generates revenue, while reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.”  As a reminder, I'm re-posting the graphic showing the percentage of economists polled by The University of Chicago who think the #GOPTaxScam will generate more debt than economic productivity.

His actions at EPA have been given a free pass for far too long:  1. Pruitt is currently under invesitigation by the EPA Office of the Investigator General (OIG) and is the subject of several other reviews for misuse of taxpayer resources, including spending 43 days, nearly a month and a half,  in Oklahoma for mostly non-official activities between March & May of this year at a cost of $15,000, chartering an Air Force jet for travel at an estimated cost of $20,000, and installing a $25,000 custom sound-proof phone booth in his office despite EPA already having one of these devices in its headquarters.   2. He has refused to respond to multiple & repeated Congressional inquiries and requests for documents, for example those pertaining to the appointment of Nancy Beck, formerly a representative for the American Chemistry Council (a major chemical lobbying organization), to head the agency’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. Several of the documents were subsequently obtained by The New York Times but the agency still has not provided anything.   3. He has engaged in a coordinated anti-science campaign during his 10 months in office, scrubbing any mention of “climate change” from EPA documents & prohibiting staff from using the phrase in conversation, dismissing leading qualified scientists from the EPA Science Advisory Board and replacing them with representatives from industries that stand to benefit from the decisions they are making  4. He has engineered a corporate takeover of the EPA, appointing people with major industry ties to consequential positions, e.g. Nancy Beck (see #2 above), replacing EPA Science Advisory Board scientists with industry representatives (see #3 above), approving a pesticide shown to harm brain development in children (Chlorpyriphos) at the request of industry, and countless other examples.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155726466551405/",NA,66,16,5,4,0,1,0,1

Ten months into the job and this is the first time he has even consented to appear before our Congressional oversight committee despite a litany of concerns.  UPDATE: Today’s hearing was a denial of science and a frustrating evasion of required transparent answers. Congress needs and deserves accountability from EPA, but until now Administrator Pruitt had avoided testifying before this committee all year. Whether TSCA, the Clean Power Plan, Superfund, drinking water, or air quality, the answers given today provided no further certainty that our federal regulators are doing the most they can to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.   In addition, Administrator Pruitt today failed to respond adequately to critical questions about the role of science, and in particular climate science, at the agency, his use of private travel and other personal perks at taxpayer expense, and the growing corporate influence in the agency’s top leadership and scientific positions. After more than two interrupted hours of dissembling testimony, nearly all of those questions remain.   The Administrator made a number of commitments today to provide the committee with additional information. I will be watching closely to ensure he delivers on those commitments and will continue working to hold EPA and the entire Trump Administration accountable for its actions.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155726623896405/",NA,125,36,38,13,2,0,6,12

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has a proven record of delivering innovative technologies that make renewable electricity generation cost-competitive. As we push our innovation economy forward, groundbreaking new technologies become even more essential.   EERE allows exactly these kinds of technologies to take root. I could not be more proud of these “first of their kind” and “game changing” new technologies that this program is helping to make a reality. In 2011, through the Sunshot Initiative, we set out to reduce the total costs of solar energy. We set ambitious goals and we invested wisely.   This past September, the SunShot Initiative successfully met the utility-scale solar cost target of six cents per kilowatt hour three years earlier than expected.   While we should herald this success, I worry that there are interests who would have us reduce our commitment to renewable energy research.   China currently invests more than double the US commitment to renewable energy research and development.   And while other countries continue to pioneer innovative renewable energy and hyper-efficient technologies, President Trump and Republican leaders are working to eliminate or gut most cutting-edge programs including the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy.   The budget proposed by the President would cut funds for EERE by 70 percent and eliminate ARPA-E entirely. These massive cuts defy common sense and will cost us dearly in the future by abandoning innovation and weakening America’s global competitiveness.   We must do more to support these groundbreaking initiatives.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155742857466405/",NA,67,12,8,2,1,0,1,0

The stakes here are very real and the consequences of losing Net Neutrality are far too numerous to list. One effect that hasn't been covered as much is the widening digital divide in our education system. For instance, here are just a few of the consequences for public libraries, according to the CEO of the NYPL The New York Public Library (full interview linked below):  ""Our users depend on the library, and libraries in general, for things like completing homework assignments, locating e-government resources, e-government services, accessing oral histories and primary source materials. Things that are resource-intensive like video and audio and image collections are dependent on a free and open internet.   Also things like applying and interviewing for jobs. More and more jobs involve a first round of interviews that are done over the internet. If we have to put things in the slow lane, we’re worried about those interview services being downgraded. In a research library capacity, we’re thinking about large datasets, the use of high-power broadband is needed to access those large datasets.  [Places] like the National Library of Medicine have huge data sources that need resource-intensive access to be able to use that data. Even things like interactive broadband classrooms, where there’s high-speed access to that classroom so the teacher or professor can use the classroom as a window into the world. All of those things, all of those uses, require high-speed access that’s dependent on a free and open internet.""","link","https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16772582/public-libraries-net-neutrality-broadband-access-first-amendment","theverge.com",33,10,46,0,1,6,13,35

Ady and thousands like him are raising their voices & being ignored by this Congress.   Watch the video below, if you can. Listen for the power in his voice.   Here is some of what he said:  ""When people don’t have health insurance, they die... this bill would do so much damage & deprive me of the medication I need to stay alive a little bit longer, and see my baby Carl learn to read, and teach him to play chess, and watch him go to first grade.  Please raise your hand if you think that the problem in America is that the richest people don’t have enough money.”   [Laughter, murmurs, several members note: “No hands”]   Who in their right mind thinks that’s what we should be doing?  Perhaps the gravest part of this bill is what it does to American democracy, the way this bill has been considered, behind closed doors in the middle of the night, with 5,000 K Street lobbyists and not a single working class person, not a single advocate for the public, not a single member of Congress from the Democratic side with access to information.   No hearings where they can hear our voices, no hearings where they can hear from tax experts or medical experts.   This is an embarrassment to the institution of the Congress.  I don’t understand why these Republicans, some of whom love this institution, tolerate this violation of basic democratic principles of transparency and accountability and voice.   So I have come to Capitol Hill along with hundreds of thousands of other people, calling on members, begging them, please do not ruin American democracy. It’s too precious.   Too many generations have fought and died for this democracy. Do not violate it or destroy it just to enrich your donors.   You can still stop this bill. We only need 12 members of the House or 3 members of the Senate to decide, actually we can pass real tax reform in a bipartisan way.   It doesn’t need to rip away medical care from me and families like me. It doesn’t need to raise taxes on 87 million Americans.   We’d be happy to come to the table to negotiate a reasonable tax reform that elevates human dignity instead of promoting human misery, that embraces the greatest parts of America instead of relegating us to an afterthought.  My last point, I know I’m taking way too much time, is to plead with the American people. Because maybe these Republican members aren’t listening to me. I spoke to Senator Jeff Flake directly. I spoke to U.S. Senator Susan Collins. I spoke to Senator Bob Corker. I don’t know, maybe they just…  Oh, actually I need to tell you this story. I need to tell you this story.  Last night in the basement of Rayburn (office bldg), I ran into Lindsey Graham. He was speaking to a bank of cameras about his beloved friend John McCain who, like me, is dying of a brain disease, who is struggling to live.   He was talking about John as a human being and as his friend. And I rolled up to him along with Megan Anderson who is almost paralyzed and we said, ‘Senator Graham, may we speak with you for a moment.’ And he ran away. There is video of this. All of you were there [points to cameras]. Go, find that video.  He ran into the area that we couldn’t go to. And that moment for me, that was emblematic of the entire disaster of this bill. Instead of listening to the American people, they are running away from us.   Lindsey Graham, the great Senator from the state of South Carolina..was afraid of two civilians in wheelchairs who wanted to talk to him about legislation in front of his body.   What am I going to do, beat him up? What is he so afraid of? What are these senators and representatives so afraid of?  They’re afraid of seeing us as human beings, they’re afraid of recognizing our humanity. Because if they did see us as human, if they acknowledged that we are people with hopes and dreams and love and families, then their legislative agenda becomes untenable.  And it is unacceptable for them to promote this bill if we are in fact human beings. So Lindsey Graham could not tolerate seeing my face and hearing my voice, and he had to run away. And that is what the entire Republican party is doing. It’s running away from the American people because it removed humanity from its vision of American government.   I will close with this, to the American people: this is our government, this is our democracy.  There is only one way to combat the money of K Street and the money that is driving this train towards an unjust and inhumane and blind piece of legislation. The only way to defeat this is if the American people rise up and elevate our voices, and we say: this is our government.  This is our Congress. This is our democracy. And we reject the politics of human oppression. We reject the politics of ignoring the American people. And we insist on a government that represents us.  So please over the coming days, weeks, months… rise with me, rise with us, reclaim this democracy, because together we can build a better country.""  This goes beyond fighting a bad #TaxScamBill. It’s about hearing the voices & witnessing the humanity and dignity of our fellow Americans.

For 64 years, Sam’s voice has greeted the residents and visitors of Montgomery County, New York Sam has been working in broadcasting since 1953.   Now at 82, he hosts the longest-running talk show in the history of the county.  Sam’s broadcasting career was born from his service with Armed Forces Radio in Germany where he delivered a nightly broadcast for three years.   Sam also worked as a print journalist for the Schenectady Gazette for some 35 years.   Decade after decade, his distinctive voice has been the catalyst for free and open debate.  He has brought an air of familiarity, and of community to our humble corner of Upstate New York.  Listening to conversations about current events with Sam has always made the abstractions of politics a little more real.   Sam’s personality has inspired many and brought light, comfort and connection to countless neighbors and friends.  Thank you to Sam Zurlo for his years of exceptional work and a legendary career in local journalism, and best wishes for an equally special retirement.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155761732286405/",NA,75,15,14,16,0,0,0,0

This is a bad sign. Public science saves lives & protects our families and our economy.  I have spent weeks asking critical questions of the @EPA:  - How is the U.S. going to recruit & retain the technical expertise necessary to protect our communities, health & environment?  - How can we prevent scientists from leaving & hollowing out the agency’s technical capacity?  Earlier this month I posed these & other critical questions to U.S. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt during his first appearance before our Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, where I serve as Ranking Member: https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/10155726466551405/","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/climate/epa-buyouts-pruitt.html","nytimes.com",46,46,64,2,4,5,86,59
