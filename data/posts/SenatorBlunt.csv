In 2015, more than 1,000 Missourians died from a lethal drug overdose. Addiction is treatable, but only around ten percent of those struggling with the disease get the help they need. This funding will expand access to treatment, recovery, and prevention programs, and strengthen our state’s ability to combat this growing epidemic. As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Department of Health and Human Services, I was proud to secure funding for this grant program in last year’s short-term government funding bill, and will continue working to prioritize resources to address the opioid crisis.","link","https://www.blunt.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=3D002BA7-6B2F-4BC2-A077-33D5F76F06CB","blunt.senate.gov",181,106,22,9,2,1,0,5

In our state, 25 counties have no companies willing to offer health care coverage on the exchanges next year and premiums are up 145 percent, on average, since 2013. The status quo is far from what was promised and it is unsustainable.  The draft health care legislation preserves access to care for people with pre-existing conditions, strengthens Medicaid and does not change Medicare, gives people more health insurance choices, and allows people to stay on their family health insurance plan until they are 26.   Members of both parties will have an opportunity to offer amendments as the process moves forward. I will carefully review the final legislation with a focus on how it will help address the problems Missourians are facing under Obamacare.
