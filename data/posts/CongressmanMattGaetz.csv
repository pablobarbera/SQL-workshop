President Trump's orders prove that yet again, he will act when the former administration would only talk and deliberate.  A ninety-day pause to consider and implement new changes is entirely appropriate.

The Warrior Games have helped me in so many ways with my recovery process, amazing/emotional experiences, gaining new friends/family, competition, and most importantly fellowship with other wounded warriors from all branches of the military branches and other countries. I am still training and plan to attend the AF Trials next year, make the AF Warrior Team, compete again in next summer's DoD Warrior Games in Colorado, and hopefully make next year's USA Team that will compete in the Invictus Games in Australia. The assistance and support for those of us in PDRL status is significantly important for us, our caregivers, and our families. I can assure you that we are forever grateful for any and all support we get.

""I am writing to explain how my involvement with the Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2) program has enriched and given meaning to my life. Emily Esfahani Smith, a professor in positive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, researched the characteristics of a meaningful life.  She found that those who find meaning in their life are more resilient, do better in in school/work, live longer, and are less likely to de by suicide.   These characteristics of a meaningful life revolve around four-pillars:  1. Belonging – Relationships where you are valued and you value others.   2. Purpose – Using your strengthens to serve others. …the Why that drives you forward.    3. Transcendence – Rising above everyday life to experience a higher reality.  Losing yourself in an activity. Flow State.  4. Story Telling – The story you tell yourself about yourself. How we became who we are.   During my 12-years in the Air Force I created and strengthened each of these pillars of a meaningful life.  I had deep meaningful relationships with those I served with, a sense of purpose in my work, transcendence, and powerful story in who I was and how I became an EOD Team Leader disarming explosives in Iraq and Afghanistan.  After being injured in Afghanistan and subsequently retiring from the Air Force, I lost each of these pillars; which removed much of the meaning from my life.  Fortunately, programs hosted by the AFW2 allow individuals like me, who have left the military and subsequently lost their sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning, a chance to start rebuilding these aspects of their new life.  These programs allow individuals to create authentic relationships with their teammates, coaches, families, volunteers, spectators, and other.  Additionally, these programs lead to a newfound and increased sense of purpose while improving their health; and allow individuals to reframe a story of tragedy, into a strength-based story of triumph.  Unfortunately, the benefits of these types of programs are now limited to Active Duty and TDRL (Temporary Disabled Retirement List) because of funding.  I would argue the population who needs these programs most, the permanently retired service member who has transitioned and lost their sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning, are no longer funded to attend these events.  It is my hope that these programs will once again be opened to permanently retired service members.  In my opinion, there would be no greater way to address many of the issues faced by a transitioning service member.  Sincerely,  Adam Popp, USAF""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanMattGaetz/photos/a.676706422508019.1073741828.674764996035495/832060726972587/?type=3",NA,41,21,2,7,0,0,0,0
