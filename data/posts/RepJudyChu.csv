Under the Affordable Care Act, the number of uninsured Americans has been cut in half as millions gained access to healthcare – many for the first time. It also has meant that no one can be denied care for a pre-existing condition. Furthermore, the ACA has held the rise in health care costs to the slowest rate in 50 years.   Yet despite the lives changed and saved, Republicans today moved forward with their plan to repeal this popular law, without any substantial proposal to replace it. This would be a disaster. Even the American Medical Association recently warned of the catastrophic impacts of the Republicans’ politically motivated repeal of the ACA.   Now that Republicans are poised to take control of both Congress and the White House, they have a responsibility to put forward a coherent plan for the American people that will let sick individuals keep their care, keep costs low, and prevent past injustices like the large discrepancy in costs for men and women. However, none of these priorities were discussed in the Republicans’ march to repeal the ACA.   It’s time to stop running against Democrats and to start showing Americans how you can help them.","link","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-congress-obamacare-repeal-20170113-story.html","latimes.com",76,38,19,2,1,4,27,45

Wartime hysteria, prejudice, and a lack of political leadership led to one of the most shameful periods in our nation’s history, where American citizens were targeted based solely on their ethnicity and stripped of their basic civil rights without any due process. These violations were so unconscionable that Congress later apologized for it. But sadly, there are new demagogues who want to repeat this dark chapter.  Seventy-five years later, we once again have a President signing Executive Orders steeped in xenophobia and racism. Even worse, there are now individuals who have gone so far as to cite Japanese American internment as a precedent for these actions. This is unacceptable.

And even though her circumstances sometimes forced her to wear the same clothes every day, she stayed in school to earn her degree. Today, she’s a freshman in college looking to develop collaborations that will help other foster youth do the same. Because of the lack of financial and emotional support, only 1% of foster youth graduate college. Foster youth, despite the numerous challenges they face early in life, more often than not seek to give back through public service and help those in similar situations.

That is why the ACA’s contraception mandate matters so much – it makes access a reality. Thanks to the ACA’s contraception protections, the percentage of women who had to pay out of pocket for contraception care dropped from 20% to 4%. Affordable access to contraception is part of why unintended pregnancy and abortion rates are at an historic low. But with this interim final rule, President Trump is threatening to roll back all of that progress by giving any employer veto power over a woman’s healthcare decisions. And let’s be clear: this is an attack on women’s health. This rule would subject a woman’s choice and the opinion of her doctor to the whims and judgments of her employer. From family planning to treatment for medical conditions like endometriosis and ovarian cysts, women use birth control to make healthy decisions for themselves and their families. Congresswoman Diana DeGette, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Congresswoman Jackie Speier and I strongly oppose this broad exemption to the contraception benefit and urge President Trump to rethink before he officially publishes the interim final rule.

In fact, in many of our lifetimes, people died just to be able to exercise their right to vote. It’s so basic that in 2007, under President Bush, the House and Senate voted bipartisanly to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. But since the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County vs. Holder, states have been rushing to make it harder to vote. They do this by limiting the number of polling places, restricting how late they’re open, requiring voter ID, redrawing voting lines, ending early voting, and more. These state restrictions are so obviously prejudiced that many have been struck down by the courts. Today, we’re introducing the Voting Rights Advancement Act to reinstate voter protections and make it harder to pass disenfranchising laws in the first place.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJudyChu/photos/a.225385020130.282208.41228315130/10159407524900131/?type=3",NA,131,10,17,18,1,0,0,0

This is a competition held every year for students in each Congressional District. The winners have their art displayed in the halls of the Capitol for a year. Tiffany’s piece, entitled “Different Beauty”, was inspired by how different standards of beauty differ across the world. As she researched and learned more, Tiffany decided to paint a depiction of four distinct women with very different standards of beauty. The first woman is from the U.S., with plastic surgery markings dotted across her face. The second woman is from the indigenous Maori people in New Zealand, where women tattoo their chins to symbolize their growth into adulthood. The third woman is from India, where intricate henna tattoos are commonly used in weddings and ceremonies. The last woman is from the Middle East, and Tiffany wanted the audience to focus on the eyes, because women who cover their faces often use eyeliner to make their eyes more noticeable. Lastly, she placed all four images on one bust as an example of the way women are objectified across societies. Yet, despite this objectification and the societal challenges placed on women, each of these four women exudes a clear sense of strength that reminds the audience that each woman is different but that all women are beautiful.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJudyChu/photos/a.225385020130.282208.41228315130/10159455461055131/?type=3",NA,183,11,10,26,0,6,0,0

For starters, it does the unthinkable by singling out one religion – Islam – as a target for the Pentagon. No other faith is subjected to this kind of discriminatory treatment.   Next, it tasks the Pentagon with determining which Muslim practices are “unorthodox,”  in direct violation of the First Amendment. It is not the role of our government to determine who is and is not a “good” Muslim.   And last, it creates a list of religious leaders who have committed no crimes, but are targets because of how they worship. Policies like this make our country indistinguishable from the enemies we’re fighting.   Fear of Muslims is not a military strategy, and it cannot be an American policy. It’s particularly striking that this bill comes during a debate to increase our military spending even as Trump and Republicans try to gut funding for diplomacy and development. It not only sends the wrong message to the world, but leaves us completely unable to lead it.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJudyChu/photos/a.225385020130.282208.41228315130/10159535142140131/?type=3",NA,22,15,4,2,0,7,3,38

What he did not know was that the spams were actually a seizure. He got himself over to the 24 hour Urgent Care and they wound up transferring him to the Emergency Room, where he was admitted and diagnosed with a Brain Tumor.  Three days later, he underwent brain surgery which is followed up by radiosurgey (radiation treatment) about a month later.  This was hundreds of thousands of dollars for the surgery and the radiation treatment. Fortunately, he had good insurance, but before the ACA, he would have had to kick in his copay for service for the whole amount. But the ACA put a cap on out of pocket expenses.  A fellow co-worker of Charles' who recently passed away from his brain tumor first came down with it before the ACA.  His treatment costs bankrupted him.

This order is a craven attempt by the President to justify his party’s attacks on the ACA, which has been successful at increasing coverage for millions. That is why Republicans have been unable to pass a repeal of the law. But refusing to accept his failure, Trump is trying to double down with this plan to peel healthy individuals away from the ACA marketplaces and make costs rise for consumers. By offering cheap plans with poor coverage, he is ensuring that only healthy people will buy them – leaving the sick and elderly with more expensive options. This signals a return to the segmented healthcare system we had before the ACA, where being sick could mean bankruptcy or worse. And it is the most vulnerable Americans who will pay this price to salve Trump’s ego.","link","https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16458184/trump-obamacare-executive-order-association-health-plans-short-term-insurance","vox.com",50,17,15,1,4,1,11,76

And while my brush with the law today was planned and civil, those words from his famous letter continue to inspire our civil disobedience. Then it was on behalf of black citizens treated as less than human. Today it is on behalf of immigrants who are facing threats of deportation and separation from family and the only home they have ever known. Dreamers have lived here their whole lives and are American in every way. They do not deserve this cruel uncertainty created by President Trump’s attack on DACA. Nor need they. There is a bipartisan bill ready to be voted on that I know could gain a majority vote if only Speaker Ryan would let us bring it to the floor. We have tried everything from large scale rallies to a small meeting with the Speaker to make our case. But each time, we have been ignored.
