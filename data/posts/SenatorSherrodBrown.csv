I met with Rita last year when she was in Washington to testify in front of the Senate Finance Committee in honor of her late husband, Butch. Butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. In fact, he led the Southwest Retirees Pension Committee’s fight against cuts to their earned benefits. He passed away on New Year’s Eve due to a stroke, which doctors have attributed, at least in part, to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts. When Rita and I met, her widow benefits had already been cut and she faced an additional 40 percent reduction because of the proposed cuts put forth by Central State.   This is disgraceful. If a pension fund is in bad shape, it’s our job to fix it – not to break our promises to Ohioans who have worked their whole lives to earn that pension. I believed that three years ago when I voted against the law that allowed these proposed cuts, and I believe it now.   Butch once said the cuts being forced on retirees amount to a war against the middle class and the American Dream - and he’s right. Ohio’s retired workers have earned their pensions and retirement savings over a lifetime of hard work – whether it’s behind a desk, on the factory floor, down in coalmines or behind the wheel.   My new plan includes ideas on how we can make it possible for more workers to save for retirement. As I said in Columbus, part of the bargain we have in this country is that if you work hard your whole life, you ought to be able to spend your later years with your grandkids – not trying to make ends meet.   After the speech, Rita gave me this framed picture of her and Butch, as well as the picture of her and I when we first met in Washington.

After watching devastating wildfires blaze through several states, farm families from across our state banded together to build up a caravan of trucks carrying hay and feed to farmers in need.   As one of the caravan’s organizers said, “Agriculture is a really cool industry to be a part of because people take care of each other.”   -SB","link","http://nbc4i.com/2017/03/20/ohio-farmers-sending-relief-to-ranchers-devastated-by-wildfires/","nbc4i.com",161,8,17,17,0,1,0,0

Richard from Mentor, Ohio summed it up well in a letter to me last year:   “It seems companies want to put more and more on workers’ backs but let them share less and less in the profits. Because of that, I’m very worried about my son’s and my grandson’s futures.”   Richard reminds us that the value of work isn’t just about the number that appears on a paycheck. When we talk about the value of work, we’re talking about families - because if work isn’t valued, Americans can’t earn their way to a better life for their children.   That’s what this four-part plan is all about – it’s for Richard and for every parent and grandparent that wants to make sure their kids can do better than they did.

I work enough hours that a second job is impossible, yet as taxes and inflation rise, and the economy worsens, it is expected for the labor laws to not apply to me because I make just enough to survive.”   This is unacceptable.

But when I think of John Glenn, I think of a good man.  My first taste of John Glenn, the good man, was on March 4, 1968, at the Madison Theater in Mansfield, Ohio.   More than fifty teenage boys had gathered for our Eagle Scout Dinner.  Colonel Glenn was the speaker.    John Glenn, national hero, met each of us.  John Glenn, perhaps the most famous man of his generation, took a picture with us – one at a time.  He always took time for you, no matter your station in life.   And that lesson has stuck with me.    Almost 39 years later, former Senator John Glenn walked me down the center aisle of the United States Senate to be sworn in.  And of course – like the Eagle Scouts of four decades earlier – all the new senators wanted to meet their American hero.  He was kind to them too....  .....A former Glenn staffer told me that, “John Glenn took joy in helping others and was so proud of his staff.  Even when you left, you were still family.”  John had a way of making everyone around him feel important – from the teenage Eagle Scouts to the farmer in the field. He lived his life by Matthew 25: Jesus admonished his followers, ""Whenever you did it for any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you did it for me.""  That was John Glenn. The great American hero, was a good man.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSherrodBrown/photos/a.261538294271438.1073741828.261478257610775/275865172838750/?type=3",NA,420,17,51,106,0,0,9,0

Jenny wrote to me from Delaware, Ohio about her concerns as a 27-year old woman who’s planning on getting pregnant in the next few years:  “I have been with my place of employment for 4 years and if I want to have a child, I would need to not use any sick or vacation time for the next 2 years to ensure that I get a few weeks with my newborn.   We are, of course, under FMLA allowed up to 12 weeks unpaid leave but I do not know any of my coworkers….who can afford to do this. Frankly, I don't know any person in any profession that can afford to do this. I know of many other women across multiple fields facing this same dilemma. I know women who worked past their due date to save up this vacation and sick time.”  Our current labor laws put women - and men - in a place they shouldn’t be in when deciding to have a child: no prospective parent should have to worry about how having a baby will affect their next paycheck.  That’s why I introduced the FAMILY Act, which creates an insurance plan that provides workers up to 12 weeks of paid family or medical leave. With this benefit, we give workers more power over their own lives and futures.   -SB","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSherrodBrown/photos/a.261538294271438.1073741828.261478257610775/281438512281416/?type=3",NA,217,20,27,42,0,1,0,0

A recent report highlighted that Ohio ranked second among large states for workers experiencing wage theft. 5.5% of Ohio workers are being shortchanged – and that’s unacceptable.  Wage theft can take many forms, including: forcing people to work off the clock, refusing to pay workers the minimum wage, denying workers overtime pay even after working more than 40 hours a week, stealing workers’ tips, or knowingly misclassifying workers to avoid paying fair wages. It’s time that we crack down on wage theft, and ensure all workers are paid fairly.

The truck driving sector has been just one example of an industry where employers have shifted their workers from full-time to independent contractors as a way to reduce workforce costs. Misclassifying workers as independent contractors just to boost corporate profits is wrong.   When workers are misclassified as independent contractors, they miss out on wages and benefits and job security that full-time employees receive. They’re also on the hook for more payroll taxes, and left vulnerable without important federal labor protections. A survey of port truck drivers found that independent contractor drivers earn 18% less than direct employee drivers – and 82% of these drivers were independently contracted.   My plan to restore the value of work prevents large employers from using the independent contractor classification to get around labor laws and boost profits by taking advantage of workers.  No worker should be cheated so their employer can make an extra buck. -SB","link","https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/news/rigged-forced-into-debt-worked-past-exhaustion-left-with-nothing/","usatoday.com",150,16,65,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It’s simple. If you work extra hours, you should earn extra pay. Yet all too often, Ohioans are working longer days without the overtime pay they’ve earned.   This month, the Trump Administration took an important step forward in delivering overtime pay for 130,000 Ohioans who were promised it under a new rule issued by the Obama Administration in 2016.  The rule – and the long overdue pay raises for Ohio workers – have been tied up in courts.  And last week, the Trump Administration did the right thing by filing an appeal to continue fighting for overtime pay.  While this is a step in the right direction, there’s more work to be done. At the same time the Labor Department announced it will move forward with defending the rule, the Trump Administration signaled it may only apply the rule to a smaller number of workers. That’s unacceptable – 130,000 Ohio workers were promised overtime pay under this rule and it’s up to President Trump to keep that promise for all 130,000. -SB","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSherrodBrown/photos/a.261538294271438.1073741828.261478257610775/318318781926722/?type=3",NA,232,4,29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hundreds of thousands of Ohio students rely on the school lunch program, and many of them don’t have access to healthy and filling meals when school cafeterias close for the summer.

Forced arbitration clauses live in the fine print. When you sign certain contracts, you may be signing away your rights.  After the fake account scandal, Wells Fargo's arbitration clauses continue to prevent customers from seeking justice. Luckily, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)’s rule will stop banks and payday lenders from using arbitration to limit your rights – but that rule is under attack in Congress.  Congress must support the CFPB rule and stand with you, not Wall Street. Take advantage of the CFPB's resources before you sign financial contracts: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/arbitration-rule/  But banks and payday lenders aren't the only abusers of forced arbitration - it exists in footnotes and fine print of all kinds of contracts. The nursing home industry is one repeat offender - many contracts force residents to give up their rights. Certain employers even include forced arbitration clauses in their contracts. Some for-profit colleges include forced arbitration clauses in their enrollment contracts for new students.   Before you ever click ""I agree"" or sign a dotted line - always read the fine print.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSherrodBrown/photos/a.261538294271438.1073741828.261478257610775/342347622857171/?type=3",NA,265,8,40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
