The Clayborn Temple has held a prominent role in our city’s and nation’s history, serving as the organizing location and starting point for the Memphis Sanitation Workers strike led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. Clayborn Temple focuses to again become a spiritual and cultural hub for the city, as it is the gateway between Downtown Memphis, Tennessee, the Central Business District, Beale Street - Memphis, the FedExForum and South City.   I was proud to help South City secure a $30 million federal Choice Neighborhood Grant in 2015 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to reinvigorate the Foote Homes housing development. I am encouraged by the work of Frank Smith and Rob Thompson who have lead the effort to restore the Clayborn Temple. I would also like to thank Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and and Paul Young and Felicia Harris from the city’s Division of Housing and Community Development for their work on the grant application. I was proud to write a letter of support to the National Park Service for the city’s grant application. Clayborn Temple was one of only 39 projects to receive federal funding. Like the National Civil Rights Museum, Clayborn Temple is a phoenix rising from the ashes and part of the Memphis civil rights legacy and trail, which will educate visitors for years to come. There is no more appropriate time for Memphis to receive this grant than at the end of the presidency of Barack Obama, our nation’s first African American president, and on the eve of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Congratulations to Clayborn Temple for receiving this significant federal civil rights grant. I look forward to working in the future to help move Memphis forward.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-announces-400000-federal-grant-clayborn-temple-preservation","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-announces-400000-federal-grant-clayborn-temple-preservation","cohen.house.gov",139,10,25,22,0,1,0,1

Soring, the intentional infliction of pain on horses’ feet and legs to achieve the high stepping pain-based, “big lick” gait, has plagued both the Tennessee Walking Horse breed and the great state of Tennessee for more than half a century. How we treat animals is a direct reflection of our character, both as individuals and a nation. Throughout my legislative career, both as a state Senator and as a Member of Congress, I have worked to raise awareness of and combat inhumane treatment of animals, and horse soring is truly one of the worst practices. The final rule incorporates two significant reforms consistent with the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act that I have sponsored and worked to advance over the past five years. I’m proud we have been able to build upon the ground-breaking legislation Senator Joe Tydings passed in 1970.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-praises-president-obama-s-decision-end-soring-tennessee-walking","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-praises-president-obama-s-decision-end-soring-tennessee-walking","cohen.house.gov",183,15,44,31,0,2,0,0

His campaign was based on hope and change. But at this time in our history, hope and change have unfortunately become fear and dread. Dr Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream is turning into a nightmare. The man who will be inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States repudiated Barack Obama from the beginning of his presidency, questioning his legitimacy, saying he wasn't born in this country, therefore he shouldn't be and was not legally the President of the United States of America. That was racism and it was a lie, and it was fake news, and it was wrong!  Donald J. Trump continued with that same vein, saying that Vladimir Putin, one of the meanest, cruelest people in power in the world, was a greater leader than Barack Obama. Your values speak to your leadership. What you do with your leadership speaks to your values. When you are for evil, for killing, for stopping democracy, and for stopping people who speak out and not allowing them to express themselves, you are not a great leader. You are an evil leader.  This president-elect said John McCain was not a hero. He said so much about Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants and people with disabilities that was despicable. He took on a woman named Meryl Streep, who is one of the great actresses of all time and a saint in many people's eyes, and condemns her on Twitter.   I had a decision to make on whether or not to attend the inauguration. I would love to attend the inauguration. I am a member of Congress through the votes of my constituents. I value our government. I appreciate it greatly. But this president ‘semi-elect’ does not deserve to be President of the United States. He has not exhibited the characteristics or the values that we hold dear. That Dr. King held dear. That John Lewis holds dear. And when he questioned the integrity of my friend, colleague and civil rights icon John Lewis, that crossed the Rubicon. I sat on the floor of the House of Representatives with John Lewis to protest the inability of the Republican Congress to give us a vote on gun violence. I sat with John Lewis then. And I will stand with John Lewis now. Therefore, I will not be attending the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States of America this week.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-not-attend-inauguration-president-elect-trump","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-not-attend-inauguration-president-elect-trump","cohen.house.gov",1409,358,211,271,9,2,17,14

Trump, I fear that America will soon be thrust into cultural and societal deterioration, a new Dark Ages. According to a report by The Hill, President-elect Trump and his team are planning to eliminate the US Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and the Legal Services Corporation, both of which help minority groups participate in the American dream. Trump plans to eliminate the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and the Office on Violence Against Women Grants, both of which help fight crime in our communities. Trump plans to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, both of which support the cultural participation in America. Trump plans to eliminate the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, both of which would be detrimental to our environment. And Trump plans to privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, limiting the freedom of press guaranteed by our Constitution. Many of these programs are essential to my constituents and for the health, safety and well-being of people all across the country. If they are eliminated, there will be far-reaching negative consequences for the country, setting us back decades.

This bill is yet another attack by Republicans on women’s health care. Defunding Planned Parenthood and other Title X family planning programs denies women, especially low-income and minority women, access to critical health care services like cancer screenings, contraception and STD prevention and treatment. The rule issued by the Obama Administration on Title X was designed to protect health care access to millions of women across the country.

In the ten days following the Presidential election, The Southern Poverty Law Center tracked 867 hate incidents. Of those, 100 were anti-Semitic in nature.  Over the past six months, I personally have seen a dramatic increase in anti-Semitic rhetoric on my social media. The President of the United States released a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day that failed to mention the Jews as victims of the Holocaust, breaking with traditions of previous presidents. When asked about the omission, the Administration said it was intentional, alarming even groups like the Republican Jewish Coalition. Not mentioning Jews when mentioning the Holocaust is a common tactic of Holocaust deniers. When repeatedly asked about increased incidents of anti-Semitism, President Donald J. Trump has consistently failed to decry these acts and instead has chosen to talk about his electoral victory, including at yesterday’s press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו. I appreciate having the opportunity to discuss this issue with Rabbi David Saperstein during our subcommittee hearing today. Ambassador Saperstein, many Jewish groups, including the ADL - Anti-Defamation League and American Jewish Committee (AJC), and many of my colleagues have expressed similar concerns about the President’s failure to denounce anti-Semitic activity. It is imperative that President Trump definitively and strongly denounce these anti-Semitic hate crimes and any other incidents of hate-based violence. The President has noted that his daughter and son-in-law are Jewish, but that is not enough. He must speak out against anti-Semitism.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cohen-and-ambassador-saperstein-discuss-rise-anti-semitism  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IENZ7SqYvCU&t=1s","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IENZ7SqYvCU&t=1s",NA,84,16,4,2,0,1,11,0

It is preventing health insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions, allowing children to stay on their parents health insurance plans until the age of 26, preventing women from being denied coverage based solely on their gender, making preventatives health services free of charge, and closing the donut hole lower prescription drug costs for seniors. It has yielded an historic drop in the rate of Americans without health insurance.  The bottom line is, the ACA works. The House Republicans have been obsessed with repealing the ACA for years, and have waited until tonight to finally release their plan. Based on early reports, I am seriously concerned.

It cuts funding for Medicaid while giving large tax cuts to the rich. It also gives a huge tax break to health insurers for bonuses they give to their executives.  Meanwhile, if your health insurance lapses, the bill allows insurers to charge you up to 30 percent more, and allows insurers to start charging more to consumers between 50 to 64 years of age.  Planned Parenthood would lose federal funding, making it more difficult for women to receive preventative health services such as mammograms, HIV testing, and access to birth control.

Free File is a public-private partnership between the IRS and tax preparation companies that provides 70 percent of all taxpayers – anyone who made $64,000 or less in 2016 – the best-known and most trusted commercial tax preparation software products at no cost.   Free File software walks taxpayers through an interview-style process online, which helps to cut down on errors and maximize their refund – importantly with no hidden costs or fees. Each year, tens of thousands of taxpayers receive a smaller refund because they fail to claim all the credits and deductions they are eligible to receive. For instance, estimates indicate up to 25 percent of people eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) fail to claim it and miss out on a refundable federal tax credit of up to $6,200.   My constituents can use the Free File program by visiting www.irs.gov/freefile and choosing the product that’s best for them, or by downloading the free IRS2Go app from Google Play, the Apple App Store or Amazon Appstore.

Trump’s FY2018 budget cuts vital programs for many Americans and will send America back to the 1950s, a time which might be revered by President Trump but was not so rosy for women, minorities and low-income Americans. President Trump’s budget eliminates all federal funding for the US Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), which helps broaden opportunities to access the American Dream, and Legal Services Corporation, which ensures that individuals can assert their rights in court.  It eliminates all federal funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Community Development Block Grants and Meals on Wheels America, and cuts funding to nutrition aid for women, infants and children (WIC), four programs of particular importance to many Memphians. It eliminates all federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, both of which support cultural participation in America. Even President’s Trump’s idol Andrew Jackson advocated for preserving literature and the arts in his 1832 Proclamation to the People of South Carolina.   The President’s budget eliminates all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is a critical source for news and educational programming for those without access to cable and satellite programming. It cuts the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by 31% and eliminates programs that support clean energy research. The U.S. Department of State would receive a 29% decrease in its budget. Trump’s budget increases the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) by more than $52 billion, but cuts the nation’s personal Department of Defense for America’s health, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), by $5.8 billion. The United States already spends more on its military than the next eight countries combined.

If you are low-income and cannot afford legal representation, you are not going to be able to successfully work against a private attorney on the other side. LSC funding is also essential for the orderly administration of justice.  Large numbers of unrepresented citizens overwhelms state courts and has negative consequences on the effective and efficient operation of the courts.  Congress must not eliminate funding for LSC.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bipartisan-opposition-elimination-funding-legal-services-corporation","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bipartisan-opposition-elimination-funding-legal-services-corporation","cohen.house.gov",103,10,5,1,0,0,1,8

NATO is critical to the safety and security of the United States and our European allies. Over the past 70 years, NATO has been an indispensable force for promoting democracy and stability in Europe. Many former-Soviet Eastern European countries have undertaken considerable political and economic reforms necessary to achieve aspirations for European integration, yet Russia has threatened the sovereignty of these nations. In these uncertain times, our friends in Eastern Europe must not be left behind. Our bipartisan resolution reaffirms the importance of harmony and stability rather than war and conflict and acknowledges NATO’s pivotal role in achieving such goals. The United States must stand alongside NATO and our Eastern European allies just as they have done for us in the Western Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.

I am proud to have drafted and passed a resolution as a Tennessee State Senator creating one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America. The Commission has focused on education to ensure we never forget, because to forget is to allow history to repeat itself. With some of the recent omissions of Jews and the Holocaust and errant remarks concerning ""centers,"" it is obvious that remembrance is more important than ever.

Elie Wiesel was one of the greatest moral forces in the world. He is a member of that rare group of people who have had a major individual impact on our world, such as Nelson Mandela, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi. I met Elie Wiesel when I was a Tennessee State Senator when he was being honored at Vanderbilt University. It was particularly special for me to meet Elie Wiesel as he was the inspiration for my passing legislation to create the Tennessee Holocaust Commission in 1984. The addition of a bust of Elie Wiesel to the U.S. Capitol, visited by Americans and people from around the world, would be most appropriate as Elie Wiesel spent his life urging all people to never forget the Holocaust. A bust of Elie Wiesel will honor a great man and will further serve to remind us all to never forget.","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-and-ros-lehtinen-introduce-bipartisan-bill-commission-bust-elie","cohen.house.gov",91,1,10,13,0,0,0,0

It is extremely frustrating to read that airlines are considering further decreases to legroom just hours after they told Congress they’re working to improve the passenger experience. It seems as if they don’t take Congress’s concerns any more seriously than they take those of their passengers.  Seat size is not just about comfort; it is about the safety and health of the flying public.

The bill includes adequate funding for important programs to Memphians that President Trump proposed cutting drastically such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition program, food stamps and Planned Parenthood. It also provides adequate funding for PBS, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, environmental protection programs and renewable energy programs.  I am particularly pleased that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be receiving a $2 billion funding increase in the omnibus bill, something for which I have long advocated. President Trump’s budget proposal included a steep $5.8 billion cut to our country’s Department of Defense for America’s personal health, the NIH. The likelihood of any of us dying by an attack from North Korea, Iran, or ISIS is rather slim, while the odds of dying from diabetes, cancer, stroke, heart disease, AIDS, or Alzheimer’s is far more likely.  Robust medical research funding will help provide treatments and find cures for the myriad of diseases that attack Americans every day.  There is no better investment for each of us in the federal budget than the war against debilitating disease and death.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-passage-fy2017-omnibus-appropriations-act","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-passage-fy2017-omnibus-appropriations-act","cohen.house.gov",72,9,4,4,0,1,0,0

This poorly-thought-out legislation, that has a mere 17% approval rating, allows states to discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions and to opt out of offering essential health benefits such as maternity care, mental health services, pediatric services, preventative care services, drug abuse treatment and physical rehabilitation services.  Trumpcare will also force lower and middle-income Americans to pay more for less coverage while the wealthiest Americans receive huge tax breaks. As many as 24 million more Americans would be uninsured and those 50-64 years of age would pay significantly higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. It will significantly reduce federal funding for Medicaid, shorten the life of the Medicare Trust Fund and waive annual and lifetime caps now prohibited by the ACA. But without an updated CBO score or time to analyze the flurry of last-minute changes, we don’t yet know the full extent of the catastrophic impacts that this bill could have on our health care system.  Trumpcare is a wealth care bill, not a health care bill. It puts politics over improving our health care system. This bill is an excuse to give the wealthiest Americans huge tax breaks and proceed towards more tax cuts for the rich in the future. It should be called the ‘Ebenezer Scrooge Act’ because it enriches the wealthiest individuals and harms the less fortunate both fiscally and physically.   https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-house-passage-trumpcare","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/videos/1519225651435205/",NA,793,191,272,76,3,1,19,64

Harsher sentences for non-violent drug crimes cost taxpayers more money and waste limited resources that are needed to go after more dangerous, violent offenders who put the public at risk. The beneficiaries of these policies are often private prisons who profit from locking up more inmates, disproportionately affecting people of color. Attorney General Sessions said, ""we know that drugs and crime go hand-in-hand…"" That’s because some drugs are inappropriately labeled as illegal, making those who use them criminals. Illegal drugs result in organized, black-market drug trading and the use of guns, similar to the way Al Capone and the gangsters operated when alcohol was illegal under prohibition. Crime increased during prohibition as Eliot Ness and the federal agents enforced prohibition laws. The thirteen failed years of prohibition in this country are analogous to how we treat marijuana today. If we don’t learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. We need to take marijuana out of the criminal justice system, so people who use marijuana are no longer labeled as criminals. Attorney General Sessions is preserving the government drug operation at the expense of the people. Poverty and crime go hand-in-hand, not drugs and crime. Many of the programs proposed by the Trump Administration will hurt people struggling with poverty as opposed to creating the kind of jobs needed to increase economic opportunity. If the Administration wants to help improve economically distressed neighborhoods, it should be focused on creating jobs and improving the economy, not building walls, eliminating and reducing health care, and locking people up for non-violent low-level drug offenses.  http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/crime/2017/05/12/ag-jeff-sessions-points-out-memphis-crime-speech-friday/319885001/","link","http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/crime/2017/05/12/ag-jeff-sessions-points-out-memphis-crime-speech-friday/319885001/","commercialappeal.com",276,60,70,4,0,4,11,89

If 218 members of Congress sign a discharge petition, the majority party in the House is required to bring the bill to the floor for consideration. After the latest developments that President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey for investigating his Administration’s ties to Russia, and then the following day compromised highly-classified code-word intelligence to the Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador, it is long past time to appoint a bipartisan, independent commission to provide the country with answers regarding Russian’s interference in our elections. Congress owes it to the American people to protect the integrity of our democratic process.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/photos/a.139593116065139.20768.111456965545421/1532604270097343/?type=3",NA,127,8,12,7,0,0,0,1

Davis to restore fairness in student lending by treating privately issued student loans the same as other types of private debt in bankruptcy. Until 2005, this type of student loan debt was dischargeable in bankruptcy, but a change to the bankruptcy code made that year removed this consumer protection. With student loan debt outpacing both auto loans and credit card debt as the largest form of non-mortgage consumer debt, Congress must take action to help reduce this burden on the American people. People who seek higher education to better their futures should not be dissuaded from doing so by the threat of financial ruin. The bankruptcy system should work as a safety net that allows people to get the education they want with the assurance that, should their finances come under strain by layoffs, accidents, or other unforeseen life events, they will be protected. Our bill will help achieve that goal, and I hope Congress considers it quickly.

Trump’s so-called ""taxpayer first"" budget would be detrimental to taxpaying low- and middle-income Americans, while it would greatly benefit super rich Americans. The President’s budget cuts Medicaid an astounding $1.4 trillion over 10 years and makes deep cuts to programs essential to many Americans such as food stamps (SNAP), Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program (WIC), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Meals on Wheels America. In addition, the President’s budget eliminates all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the primary health care provider for low-income women, and would slash billions from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the CDC, putting America’s health at risk. The budget significantly cuts Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), the US Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), Legal Services Corporation, Community Development Block Grants, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of State, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and more. The list of draconian cuts is huge. All of these cuts come as the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) would receive a more than $500 billion increase in its budget over 10 years even though the United States already spends more on its military than the next eight countries combined. An increase of that magnitude is unnecessary and should never come at the expense of these other programs that directly help Americans on a day-to-day basis. Cuts to these programs have also been proposed to allow for more tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. This is cruel, bad policy, morally wrong and contrary to the President’s campaign promises. This is no ""taxpayer first"" budget, it is a ""rich people first"" budget. It delivers a huge blow to hard-working, taxpaying Americans who rely on government assistance to help provide for their families.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-trump-s-fy2018-budget","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-trump-s-fy2018-budget","cohen.house.gov",113,25,49,2,0,4,20,65

For all of its shortcomings, the Trump Administration ought to have little difficulty grasping the severe economic impact of retreating from the Paris Climate Agreement.  By joining our allies in the agreement, the United States stood to save $5.3 trillion from subsidizing the negative effects associated with paying the healthcare costs from exposure to pollution. Instead of committing 6.5% of our GDP to subsidizing fossil fuel industries and cleaning up their pollutants, that portion of wealth amassed by American taxpayers could be used to fix aging infrastructure, a supposed goal of the Trump Administration. But rather than promote American competitiveness, the Trump Administration has placed the United States in a league with Syria and Nicaragua.  The President’s decision to retreat from the Paris Climate Agreement could prove to be a calamitous decision to humanity. Without action, the continued effects of climate change will lead to increased instances of natural disasters, severe drought and famine across the globe that could result in humanitarian crises and war. Withdrawal from the agreement means turning our backs on protecting against the loss of coastal cities, beaches and habitats, as well as on goals for waste reduction and resource recovery.  I supported President Obama’s decision to join more than 160 countries in signing the Paris Climate Agreement, and I’m disappointed in President Trump’s decision to follow Syria and Nicaragua.

The President’s engagement with then-FBI Director James Comey nine times in one-on-one conversations coupled with his reported efforts to personally engage with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo to put an end to the Flynn investigation contribute to an attempt by President Trump to obstruct justice.

The President called the House health care bill ‘mean.’ The Senate version is equally as mean.  Millions of people will likely lose their health insurance and many lower and middle-income Americans will be forced to pay more for less coverage. The Senate version still has a crushing age tax, meaning those 50-64 years of age would pay significantly higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The tax breaks are a gift financially for the wealthiest two percent of Americans.    This bill was hastily crafted behind closed doors with zero input from Democrats, women or minorities. Even members of the so-called health care working group, all of whom are white Republican men, had almost no input in the process. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose this heartless bill and ensure Americans have access to the quality, affordable health insurance they deserve.   https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-senate-republicans-bill-repeal-affordable-care-act","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-senate-republicans-bill-repeal-affordable-care-act","cohen.house.gov",152,25,44,3,0,1,30,50

The Helsinki Commission, or the Commission of Security and Cooperation in Europe, is a bipartisan, bicameral independent agency of the federal government that promotes human rights, democracy, and economic, environmental, and military cooperation in the 57-nation OSCE region. The Commission consists of nine members from the U.S. Senate, nine members from the U.S. House of Representatives, and one member each from the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce. I was proud to be recommended by Nancy Pelosi in 2011 to serve on the Helsinki Commission.  Representatives from several European nations and others attended the annual assembly meeting. We discussed a variety of issues such as the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, terrorism from ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Middle East and Europe, immigration concerns in countries like Greece, Italy and Turkey, and cybersecurity threats to elections around the world. The U.S. delegation consisted of Chairman of the Helsinki Commission Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), Co-Chairman Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ), Ranking Member Congressman Alcee L. Hastings (D-FL), Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Congresswoman Gwen S. Moore (D-WI) and others.          During the assembly meeting, I offered one amendment to the Resolution on Political Affairs and Security and one amendment to the Resolution on Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions. Both amendments passed. The first amendment encourages political leaders, especially in the Western Balkans, to refrain from using political or nationalistic rhetoric that could inflame ethnic tensions and compromise individual rights. Promoting individual rights and committing to equal justice are fundamental to a strong democracy.  My second amendment encourages the elimination of criminal defamation laws in countries where they still exist. Oppressive leaders around the world have used criminal defamation laws to silence dissident voices and imprison political opponents. I have spent my career in Congress fighting for fair defamation laws. I was proud that President Barack Obama signed my Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage (SPEECH) Act into law in 2010. This law protects American authors, journalists and publishers from foreign defamation judgments that undermine the First Amendment and American due process standards.  Also in Minsk, Senator Wicker, Congressman Smith and I met with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. We implored him to recognize the importance of human rights and to promote democracy in Belarus. The United States has imposed sanctions on Belarus for violations of human rights. We also discussed the planned September military exercises in Belarus with the Russians and the Baltic States’ fear that it could be a precursor to an invasion. We stressed the need for American monitors during those military exercises.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/videos/1586953194662450/",NA,60,7,3,6,0,0,0,0

Trump. Since taking office in January, President Trump has exhibited unacceptable and often offensive behavior for a President of the United States. He has taken the unprecedented action in the modern era of refusing to release his tax returns. He has refused to divest from his private business interests, creating conflicts of interest and potential violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause. He fired his F.B.I. Director while the F.B.I. was investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. He recklessly provided Russian officials with classified information during an oval office meeting. He has repeatedly used Twitter to insult and undermine the press, Congress, and the Judiciary. His Cabinet has the fewest number of women and minorities since the Reagan Administration. The gender pay gap at the Trump White House is more than double the national average. The list goes on and on and on...   President Trump has been President for six months and his probationary period is long over. This resolution sends a clear message to the President that we disapprove of his cumulative actions, that we are simpatico with our constituents and a majority of the America people, and that we have no confidence in his service.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ranking-member-cohen-introduces-resolution-no-confidence-president","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/photos/a.139593116065139.20768.111456965545421/1601894023168367/?type=3",NA,633,95,187,96,3,5,0,35

He is demonstrably the antithesis of one who adheres to core principles of Scouting. It is disappointing that the BSA engaged him to speak at the National Jamboree, disappointment made still worse by the content of his speech. It is appropriate at this time for National President Randall L. Stephenson and National Commissioner Charles W. Dahlquist II to each tender their resignations from their volunteer positions with the Boy Scouts of America. Additionally, any other members of the National Executive Committee who were affirmatively involved in arranging for President Trump to speak at the 2017 National Scout Jamboree should also resign.  President Trump's historically unapologetic bad behavior and commentary both disqualified him from inclusion in a BSA event and made his unacceptable comments at the Jamboree easily predictable. An effective and responsible leadership team would have been proactive in shielding our Scouts from this corrupting influence, and definitely wouldn't have endorsed it.  The motivation for this communication is not political, but moral. President Trump has, through his own public actions, policies, and commentary, empirically violated nearly every tenant of the Scout Oath, Scout Law, and Outdoor Code. Unfortunately, the BSA leadership's judgement has been corrupted by the star power and influence of the presidency which leaves many of us to wonder about its commitment to the organization's guiding principles as outlined below.  The Scout Oath:  ""On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.""  The Scout Law (with explanations of each quality from meritbadge.org ):  ""A Scout is Trustworthy -A Scout tells the truth. He keeps his promises. Honesty is part of his code of conduct. People can depend on him.  A Scout is Loyal -A Scout is true to his family, Scout leaders, friends, school, and nation.  A Scout is Helpful -A Scout is concerned about other people. He does things willingly for others without pay or reward.  A Scout is Friendly -A Scout is a friend to all. He is a brother to other Scouts. He seeks to understand others. He respects those with ideas and customs other than his own.  A Scout is Courteous -A Scout is polite to everyone regardless of -age or position. He knows good manners make it easier for people to get along together.  A Scout is Kind -A Scout understands there is strength in being gentle. He treats others as he wants to be treated. He does not hurt or kill harmless things without reason.  A Scout is Obedient -A Scout follows the rules of his family, school, and troop. He obeys the laws of his community and country. If he thinks these rules and laws are unfair, he tries to have them changed in an orderly manner rather than disobey them.  A Scout is Cheerful -A Scout looks for the bright side of things. He cheerfully does tasks that come his way. He tries to make others happy.  A Scout is Thrifty -A Scout works to pay his way and to help others. He saves for unforeseen needs. He protects and conserves natural resources. He carefully uses time and property.  A Scout is Brave -A Scout can face danger even if he is afraid. He has the courage to stand for what he thinks is right even if others laugh at or threaten him.  A Scout is Clean -A Scout keeps his body and mind fit and clean. He goes around with those who believe in living by these same ideals. He helps keep his home and community clean.  A Scout is Reverent -A Scout is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties. He respects the beliefs of others.""  The Boy Scout Outdoor Code: ""As an American, I will do my best to— Be clean in my outdoor manners Be careful with fire Be considerate in the outdoors Be conservation-minded""  Again, I call at this time for the immediate resignations of both National President Stephenson and National Commissioner Dahlquist, as well as resignations of any other members of the National Executive Board who played an affirming role in engaging President Trump's participation in the event. Your past service is appreciated, but it is time for new leadership.""","status",NA,NA,630,64,201,83,2,36,6,4

At the time, the Memphis VA had gone through several interim directors and the previous permanent director transferred due to issues at the hospital.

These victims have experienced suffering, loss of property and, in some cases, loss of life. In addition to the irreplaceable human lives lost, each of these natural disasters have and will cost American taxpayers billions of dollars in cleanup, search-and-rescue and reconstruction costs. They have had an extraordinary economic and environmental impact, which I believe has been exacerbated by climate change and will only get worse in time. We should come together as a country to aid victims of natural disasters, just as the country came to the aid of Memphians during past flooding and tornado events.   We need stronger infrastructure and better laws to protect against flooding and prohibit building housing in flood plains. Now is not the time to cut funding for climate change research. Now is not the time to consider cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans. We should be reforming our tax structure to ensure middle- and lower-income Americans have more disposable income to stimulate the economy and the federal government has sufficient funds to respond to natural disasters and international crises without taking funding from health care and other essential life preserving programs.  https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-recent-natural-disasters-united-states","link","https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cohen-s-statement-recent-natural-disasters-united-states","cohen.house.gov",62,3,0,4,0,0,0,0

Authorization for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expires at the end of the month. CHIP, a program with a long history of bipartisan support, provides health insurance for children in low-income families that might not qualify for Medicaid coverage.  Congress must also reauthorize another bipartisan program, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program (MIECHV), which provides home visits  from nurses, social workers and other trained professionals to assist new parents from low-income households with raising their children. Authorization for community health centers, which serve low-income and uninsured Americans, expires on September 30, as well as, authorization for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program, which recruits and trains medical professionals across the county.   Congressional Republicans will also continue their assault on the Affordable Care Act next week. The latest bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, introduced by Senator Linsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), guts Medicaid, eliminates lifetime caps and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and defunds Planned Parenthood, among other things. It’s the worst version of Trumpcare yet!  Finally, Congress will need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). While I do not support the privatization of the Air Traffic Controllers in the current House bill, I am pleased that my amendment to require the FAA to set a minimum seat size of airplane seats for the safety and health of passengers. Please be assured that I will join my Democratic colleagues in Congress to ensure that all of these vital programs are renewed in an appropriate manner for Fiscal Year 2018.","status",NA,NA,61,14,6,3,0,0,0,0

Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention, who is rightly concerned about white supremacist rallies set for tomorrow in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro. It reminded me of how Martin Luther King Jr. preached peace in a climate of hostility in his day. This is how Moore put it: “If the horror in Charlottesville taught us anything, it’s that white nationalism cannot be ignored but must be exposed explicitly. In the aftermath of the event, which resulted in the death of a young woman who chose to stand in the face of evil, I argued that it was of utmost importance for the church to speak, bringing a word of moral witness against these noxious displays of white supremacy and racial demagoguery. And many have. The truth, though, is that the church must oppose this by, first, knowing that it will not go away on its own. We should also recognize where this comes from.

Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia, including Tennessee, require residents to be at least 21 to receive a concealed carry handgun permit.

Graydon Carter is one of the great journalists of our time. He co-founded and edited Spy Magazine and the New York Observer, and at Vanity Fair he gave a venue to writers like Michael Lewis, Dominick Dunne and Christopher Hitchens.   From the beginning at Spy Magazine, and later in his work with the New York Observer and Vanity Fair, he pointed out the shortcomings of Donald Trump, giving him the appellation ""short-fingered vulgarian.""

Mark DeSaulnier, I introduced H.R. 4622, the Stop Underrides Act, a bill to help prevent deadly truck underride accidents.   The bills introduced in the House and Senate today would require underride guards on the sides and front of large, long-haul trucks in an effort to prevent a car from sliding underneath a truck in an accident -- such guards are already required for the back of a truck, but the standards are outdated and the accidents can be deadly.  This is the type of legislation that doesn't have deep-pocket support; it doesn't have interest groups with money to push it forward and support it. But it does have the interests of the people and the safety of the people behind it, and for that reason it's just the right thing to do.   It's the kind of legislation that should be advocated for in Congress more often, and I'm proud to work to advance it.

I agree with Deputy AG Rosenstein, and so does FBI Director Wray. In fact, nearly everyone in Congress agreed with this summation of Robert Mueller when he was appointed as Special Counsel, and were confident in his abilities when he was unanimously appointed to be FBI director, twice, under both President Bush and President Obama.   The fact is that the GOP didn't start to dislike Robert Mueller until he started to get at issues that affected President Trump. Because of that they say that the FBI is ""in tatters,"" and they question the loyalty of some of the most dedicated, fearless people in our country.  The people who serve at the FBI and Department of Justice are the cream of the crop in law enforcement, and to criticize them in such a way is repugnant.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/videos/1749372891753812/",NA,142,23,20,23,0,0,0,1

The GOP tax scam is a theft from the middle class. 83% of the tax cuts will go to the wealthiest 1%. They propose to pay for these gifts to the rich with deep cuts to essential programs like Medicare and Medicaid, by driving up taxes on suburban families by modifying the State and Local Tax Deduction, by putting the goal of home ownership farther out of reach by playing with the Mortgage Interest Deduction -- essentially, by telling the middle class to pay for it.   Congress has plenty of real work to do. We need an immediate re-authorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and to fund Community Health Centers. We need to authorize additional resources to address shortfalls at the VA. We need emergency funding for communities impacted by hurricanes and wildfires, bipartisan pension reform, resources to address the opioid epidemic, and much more.   Instead of finding new ways to further enrich corporate America and the already-wealthy, Republicans should join us in addressing these issues, and in working together to improve the lives of a majority of Americans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/videos/1755341297823638/",NA,100,25,19,4,2,2,11,8

I have been pleased to see others begin to express similar concern, including this morning on MSNBC's Morning Joe.   Presidential pardons are not supposed to be a way for presidents to put themselves, their families, or members of their staff above the law, or to obstruct justice if there is investigation of wrongdoing. Unless we amend our Constitution, this is how the Trump Administration could subvert presidential pardoning authority in an attempt to escape justice.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanSteveCohen/videos/1755587777798990/",NA,63,29,15,8,4,3,0,8
