Garvey was the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association that was dedicated to promoting African-American resettlement in Africa. He was one of the most prominent orators of the Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism, movements. He then went on to create a Pan-African philosophy that inspired a mass movement, known as Garveyism.   When Garvey migrated to the United States, he launched several businesses that promoted a separate black nation. Garvey would eventually go on to inspire the Nation of Islam and the Rastafarian movement. Marcus Garvey passed away in London in 1940 after suffering from several strokes. His body was not immediately taken to Jamaica because of World War II. In 1964, Garvey‚Äôs remains were exhumed, and then relocated to Jamaica. The government proclaimed him Jamaica‚Äôs first national hero, and re-interred him at a shrine in National Heroes Park.   Garvey‚Äôs legacy left a lasting impact on the civil rights movements and inspired many political activists. Many notable black political activists can still recognize his contributions today. #BHM #BlackHistory #USVIdelegate","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repstaceyplaskett/photos/a.671853769590888.1073741828.665951613514437/1113348395441421/?type=3",NA,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

This amendment increases reimbursement to the local government of the Virgin Islands for aid in response and recovery from Hurricane Irma. The Congresswoman released the following statement:  After seeing first hand the destruction Hurricane Irma has done to the Virgin Islands, the sooner we receive federal dollars flowing to us the quicker our recovery can begin. It is clear that Americans and the federal government are standing with Virgin Islanders as we recover from the destruction from Hurricane Irma. I have heard from people from all across the world that want to help and support us.   Recently I wrote to FEMA and the White House for extraordinary support.  (Letter is attached) I am happy to announce that the President is in agreement and has determined that an increase in the federal government will increase their share of the cost for certain areas.  Therefore, the President is now agreeing to authorize a 90 percent Federal cost share for debris removal, including direct Federal assistance; and a 100 percent Federal cost share for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, for 30 days from the start of the incident period, and then a 90 percent Federal cost share thereafter which previously had been 75 percent.  Individuals on the islands of St. John and St. Thomas can register with FEMA the following ways: Apply online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.  Constituents may call the registration phone number at 1-800-621-3362; those who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362. Also for more information on recovery efforts happening in the Virgin Islands go to the Facebook Page 'USVI Hurricane Irma Alert'  for more details.","link","http://www.disasterassistance.gov/","disasterassistance.gov",81,14,37,13,0,1,0,0

CEO Alvaro Pilar said, ‚ÄúWe know that many residents on St. Thomas do not have access to connectivity because of the sheer volume of downed lines and the lack of power to most customers, which affects our Hybrid-Fiber Coax network. We are working very closely with our partners at VI Water and Power Authority to get both systems up as soon as possible.‚Äù  Pilar stated, ‚ÄúIn the interim, we are doing everything within our power to provide options for our customers. Effective today, Viya is establishing Viya-Fi hotspots at three locations: Tutu Park, Havensight and Emile Griffith Park.‚Äù  Rather than merely providing traditional phone banks that will create long lines as customers wait to speak on a finite number of landlines, Viya has developed Viya-Fi hotspots that will allow over 250 people at a time to bring their device, smartphone or tablet, to the site for connectivity. Customers will be able to make voice calls, send text messages and send e-mail. By Thursday Viya will also have staff on site to provide wireless devices for those individuals that do not have one.   ‚ÄúWe know that most customers have some type of wireless device and this is the most efficient way to serve the maximum number of people in an orderly fashion. When members of the community go to the aforementioned sites, they should log on to ViyaFi_FREE_ACCESS. All sites will have the same log-in information and you do not have to be a Viya customer to use our hotspots,‚Äù continued Pilar.  Pilar concluded, ‚ÄúViya is very excited about and committed to being able to provide a viable solution to assist with the community‚Äôs communication needs. We plan to add additional hubs in the future on St. Thomas and St. John.‚Äù","status",NA,NA,16,3,26,4,0,0,0,0

Maria is moving WNW at 15 mph, and this motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through Tuesday..   On the forecast track, the center of Maria will move across the Leeward Islands Monday night.  Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph, with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Maria is expected to become a hurricane later today or tonight.  At present, there are no Tropical Storm or Hurricane Watches or Warnings in effect for coastal areas of the United States or its Territories.  Interests in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Maria.   Tropical Storm or Hurricane Watches and Warnings will likely be issued later today.  Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 6 to 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches across the Leeward Islands, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands through Wednesday night.  These rainfall amounts could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.  Swells generated by Maria are beginning to affect the Lesser Antilles.

What is new?  Please be assured that we are moving the mail from the mainland to US Virgin Islands.  We have great partners on the mainland in postal facilities up and down the coastline.  They are doing exceptional preparation of the mail for us.  It makes processing here more effective given some of our common challenges like curfews, the shifts of our staff or access to full power. That continues to improve and our work continues to improve as well.  We are diligently working with our contractors for air and cargo ships to keep the mail flowing and we are fortunate to have extra support on hand from the US Postal Inspection Service who works with us on all matters of security.    Assessments show that two of our locations ‚Äì Fredericksted, St Croix and Veterans Station, St Thomas ‚Äì suffered significant damage.  We will look to provide alternate service for these customers for some time.   We are, however, more optimistic that a return to onsite services will be possible in Cruz Bay and in our Emancipation Gardens facilities following repairs and cleanup, possibly early next week or even this weekend.  In addition, four postal facilities ‚Äì Charlotte Amalie, Christiansted, Kingshill and Cruz Bay -- have begun residential deliveries where possible.     In total, nine locations are serving our community today in the US Virgin Islands.  We have just a few spots are requesting that local customers go to an alternate office for pickup.  For that reason, we remind postal customers and mailers ‚Äì use your regular mailing address.    This is how service in our offices looked today:  ‚Ä¢ Tutu Mall East End, St Thomas 00805: o Facility Open for customer pick up o No Retail Services   o 9 am to 4 pm  ‚Ä¢ Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas 00801, 00802: o No Retail Services  o Facility Open for customer pick up for Veteran‚Äôs Station (00803), and Charlotte Amalie  o 9 am to 4 pm o Charlotte Amalie letter carriers have begun to attempt deliveries where conditions are safe and passable.  ‚Ä¢ Havensight, St Thomas 00801:  o Retail Service  o Facility Open for customer pick up and for Havensight and Emancipation (00804)   o 9 am to 4 pm  ‚Ä¢ St Croix:   o Kingshill Post Office, Christiansted Main Post Office, Downtown Office, Gallows Bay and Sunny Isle are open for pick up  o Kingshill and Christiansted letter carriers have begun to attempt deliveries where conditions are safe and passable.  ‚Ä¢ Cruz Bay, St John 00830-831 o Continues truck-side service with retail offerings o 9 am to 2 pm  o Cruz Bay letter carriers have begun to attempt deliveries where conditions are safe and passable.  Finally, we are pleased to share that we have accounted for 100 percent of our 156 percent of our postal employees who serve in the US Virgin Islands.  As well you know, we can work around broken buildings but we have no service without our good people.  This is good news.","status",NA,NA,54,4,37,2,0,0,0,0

Please find below a copy of a letter I sent to Governor Mapp explaining the need for better coordination from the local government with my office in Washington, DC.  The Honorable Kenneth Mapp Governor The Virgin Islands of the United States Government House Charlotte Amalie, VI  00802   Dear Governor Mapp:   I am writing to you to express my concern about the ongoing hurricane recovery efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The recent hurricanes have brought devastation to our three islands unlike anything experienced in recent history.  Recovery and rebuilding efforts will require an extraordinary level of coordination and cooperation between local and federal government, along with private sector partnerships from local, national, and international businesses and organizations. We have in this moment both an opportunity and a responsibility to ensure that the greatest good emerges from this calamity to our Virgin Islands.  This is an opportunity to not just rebuild but to create an exponentially better Virgin Islands; advancing technologies, mitigating energy issues and creating resilience in our critical infrastructures.   As the elected representative of the Virgin Islands in Congress, it is my duty and responsibility to advocate, legislate, and support the needs of the residents in the territory at the federal level.  The people of the USVI are best served by all hands not only working, but working together.  I have assured you on a number of occasions that I stand ready to support the local government and our people during this time.  Unfortunately, you have neither engaged in any outreach to my office on any substantive matter related to either Hurricanes Irma or Maria, nor have you sought to partner with my office on any requests from the USVI to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or other legislative/funding requests to Congress.     My staff has been working tirelessly ‚Äì as we all remain indebted to your agency heads, officials and government staff for doing the same ‚Äì to ensure that the USVI can meet its needs during this time of crisis.  In these disasters, however, the people of the Virgin Islands are best served when local government coordinates with its Congressional office so that the elected delegate to Washington can advocate on behalf of the territorial government to federal authorities, or to be in a position to support and help validate your requests when federal and Congressional stakeholders, more often than not, seek our position on such appeals.     One example of this lack of coordination to date is on the issue of local housing.  FEMA officials have indicated that you have been presented options for temporary housing for individuals requiring such assistance; however, plans ‚Äì if any exist ‚Äì have not been communicated to my office.  While you very well may have formally requested some form of federal housing assistance, I have received no indication from federal authorities of any request made to receive assistance through FEMA‚Äôs Rapid Repair Program, which, depending on the extent of home damage, could help provide immediate support so that displaced individuals can get back in their homes.   Another example is in outreach and coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The agency just this week has finally begun water safety testing in homes ‚Äì indeed a critical service for VI residents.  Unfortunately, in subsequent conversations I have had with federal officials, EPA was not even aware that many homes received water from cisterns instead of potable sources.  Surely we can work together on something as simple as ensuring a federal agency has a true understanding of the local residential infrastructure so its personnel can seamlessly execute on such an important and vital mission.   I am concerned that there has been no communication or coordination in any requests that have been made to the Department of Defense (DoD).  As I trust you understand, DoD has tremendous capabilities and assets that can be made available during disasters.  Have you at any point formally requested a senior general officer to be appointed and to manage the recovery effort on the ground?  Additionally, have you at any point requested an offshore medical vessel or floating hospital ‚Äì akin to the USNS Comfort ‚Äì be made available to USVI residents, a particularly helpful asset given the current status of our hospitals?     Finally, I have read news reports and also been informed by many of my Congressional colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee ‚Äì the committee which allocates federal dollars ‚Äì that you have indicated $750 million will be sufficient for our rebuilding process in the Virgin Islands.  After extensive conversations with the Army Corp, developers, recovery experts, and Members of Congress intimately involved in prior recovery legislation (notably after Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and Superstorm Sandy), this amount seems to be a mere fraction of what will actually be needed in the long-term.  Can you please verify this amount and your rationale?  I believe we cannot undercut or in any way minimize our true need, but instead be positioned to fight for every last federal dollar to ensure our territory and its people can be made whole after the historic devastation we have just endured.     Since even before Hurricane Irma made landfall on St. John, I have made it a point to rally behind your leadership ‚Äì which during a disaster is rightfully entrusted to chief executives at the state, territorial and local levels ‚Äì to immediately respond and protect our people.  As the immediate relief and emergency response in the USVI shifts to a rebuild and long-term recovery phase, I will be consulted by many stakeholders in Washington and on Capitol Hill tasked with allocating and accounting for federal resources.  Any real or perceived lack of transparency or communication from your office on the specific needs and current gaps that might exist will only diminish individuals‚Äô confidence in us and hamper our collective ability to provide the greatest immediate and long-term support to our people.     I am returning to the territory today with Vice President Pence and wish to meet with you to discuss collaboration on federal requests as the USVI continues to recover and rebuild.  Our proud Virgin Islanders are looking to us in their greatest time of need to fight for them and show strength to the rest of the United States and the world.     I look forward to hearing from you.   ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã Sincerely, ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã     ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãStacey E.

I was informed by the Deputy Postmaster General that the Postal Service added 200 additional temporary workers in Puerto Rico to sort backlogged mail and daily flights are continuing to move the mail.   ‚ÄúI have received the commitment of the US Postal Service through Deputy Postmaster General Stroman that within the week mail for the Virgin Islands will be sorted and routed through Miami instead of Puerto Rico in order to address the problems expressed by the residents of the Virgin Islands. The United States Postal Service will be using a commercial carrier to route mail for the residents of the Virgin Islands in order to ensure timely delivery.    ‚ÄúThe Deputy Postmaster General has acknowledged that it is important for him to be in the Virgin Islands to assess firsthand the damages to our postal facilities in order for him to understand the concerns of the residents of the Virgin Islands. He has accepted the invitation from my office to make a visit to the territories in short order to understand and see for himself the concerns I and the people of the Virgin Islands have concerning our longstanding issues with the mail service. I look forward to his visit to the Territories and working with him to alleviate our problems with our mail service.‚Äù ###","status",NA,NA,113,33,85,24,0,3,0,0
