Lou Barletta introduced H.R. 4493, Eric‚Äôs Law, named in honor of fallen Bureau of Prisons Correctional Officer Eric Williams.  Eric was brutally murdered by an inmate while he was doing his nightly rounds at United States Penitentiary Canaan.  In the trial for Eric‚Äôs killer, there was no dispute of guilt with the defense stating that he was guilty ‚Äúbeyond all reasonable doubt.‚Äù The jury deliberated for 5 hours and returned a split decision, with 11 jurors in favor of the death penalty and 1 juror voting for life in prison. The inmate, who was a convicted murderer and already sentenced to life in prison, was sentenced to life in prison for viciously murdering Eric, essentially receiving no consequence for his actions.   Eric‚Äôs Law provides a fix for this miscarriage of justice by allowing an attorney for the government to motion the court to impanel a new jury for the penalty phase only.  Allowing a second jury to have another look during the penalty phase will provide the prosecutor an additional tool if the facts show that the jury system did not work as intended. This approach is modeled after several states that already use such a procedure in death penalty cases, such as California, Arizona and Kentucky.  Eric‚Äôs law will ensure that families of fallen loved ones can get the justice they deserve.","link","https://marino.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-marino-barletta-introduce-eric-s-law-sentencing-reform-bill","marino.house.gov",177,43,88,13,0,1,0,3
