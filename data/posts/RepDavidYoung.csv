David Young","2017-08-08","2017-08-08 17:36:13","Open Office Hours are a resource for Iowans who reside in the Third Congressional District to meet one-on-one with the Congressman to discuss opinions, concerns, and ideas about the issues being discussed in Congress or to get casework assistance with problems they may be having with a federal agency or program.  Residents of Iowa’s Third District who are interested in meeting with Congressman Young are encouraged to attend any of the Open Office Hours events. Individual, ten-minute meetings to discuss personal concerns, opinions and possible casework needs will take place with constituents in attendance on a first-come, first-serve basis. Participants must be residents of one of the 16 counties of Iowa’s Third Congressional District. To confirm residency within the District, individuals should visit the U.S. House of Representatives “Find my Representative” page located at: http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ or contact one of Congressman Young’s Constituent Services Offices to inquire.  Constituents with further questions regarding Congressman Young's Open Office Hours events should contact Congressman Young’s Des Moines Constituent Services Office by telephone at (515) 282-1909. Residents may also sign up to receive notification about future events online at the “Public Meeting Events” tab at Young.House.Gov","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/112734266035886/",NA,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is a failed law that does not work for everyone and the problems and costs created by it are only going to get worse with each passing year.  Great leaders know when to pause a journey down a path that isn’t working and see the opportunity and optimism in starting over.  Bottom line - we need laws that work for all Americans and for all patients - not just some. It is a fundamental principle that repeal, reforms and fixes to our healthcare are done in the right way, for the right reasons, and in the right amount of time it takes to ensure we avoid the mistakes of seven years ago.  I applaud the President, House leadership and my Republican colleagues in taking the bold move to pause and begin anew with a thoughtful and deliberate process that takes the time and input to get this right to achieve accessible, affordable quality healthcare for every American.”","link","https://davidyoung.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-youngs-statement-american-health-care-act-development","davidyoung.house.gov",101,95,16,10,4,0,0,8

This legislation is one of a series of measures the House considered and passed this week to protect our kids from predators, abduction, abuse and exploitation. Sadly, that’s a nightmare hundreds of thousands of parents in this country face. Last year alone, there were more than 465,000 reports of missing children — and those were just the cases that were reported.   This legislation updates the programming of the great work done at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) with additional tools to carry out its critical work on behalf of vulnerable children.  H.R. 1808 updates and streamlines the Missing Children’s Assistance Act — with reforms to encourage and increase public awareness of new and innovative ways to recover and protect missing and exploited children. The bill also better protects the growing number of children who go missing from state care or are victims of sex trafficking, while also providing transparency surrounding recovery and prevention efforts.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDavidYoung/photos/a.695322273919779.1073741828.694760817309258/1287988527986481/?type=3",NA,7,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I know writing legislation and having it signed into law does not alone fix a problem. And since the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act was signed into law, I have been working with my colleagues and those at the VA and VCL and conducting oversight to make sure they have everything they need to ensure not a single call goes unanswered.","link","https://davidyoung.house.gov/media-center/weeklyreport/helping-our-veterans-crisis","davidyoung.house.gov",21,5,2,2,0,0,0,1

These thieves are striking year-round using multiple methods – postal mail, telephone, social media, text messaging, fax and email - to set up their victims. During a House Appropriations Committee hearing in May, I had the opportunity to ask IRS officials about the most common scams targeting taxpayers.   (One point to always remember at all times: The IRS doesn't initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media channels to request personal or financial information. In addition, IRS does not threaten taxpayers with lawsuits, imprisonment or other enforcement action.

Agro-terrorism is a real threat and this new law takes the necessary and critical steps to protect America from high-risk events which pose serious threats to our food, across Iowa and United States.

Whether parents or grandparents, friends or neighbors, our seniors across the country impart life lessons and wisdom. They have and continue to contribute lifetimes of experience as teachers, doctors, service men and women and more, and make our communities and nation so great. As our loved ones age, it’s our responsibility to make sure they are able to live well, by ensuring they have access to the information and resources they need.  With this in mind, I have organized and will host the Second Annual series of Iowa Senior Wellness and Security Expos in July to help connect Iowa seniors, their families, and caretakers with the variety of information, services and resources available to them. These expos are free of charge and all Iowans are welcome to attend. The expos will take place in Waukee on July 10th, Creston on July 21st and Council Bluffs on July 29th and will provide attendees with a one-stop-shop of local, regional, state and federal services.","link","https://davidyoung.house.gov/media-center/weeklyreport/july-s-wellness-and-security-expos-offer-information-and-help-iowa-seniors","davidyoung.house.gov",16,15,5,0,0,0,0,2

At a recent meeting with Iowans I was discussing this work by the House to combat this growing epidemic. A hand shot up from the group as I finished my comments. The Iowan said, “Congressman, human trafficking is a big city problem, this doesn’t happen here in Iowa.”  The sad reality is human trafficking does exist in Iowa.  The fight to end the human trafficking is not a battle reserved for law enforcement alone. Each and every one of us can play a role in stopping one the greatest humanitarian tragedies of our time.

One of the most important factors preventing seniors from continuing to age in place is ensuring the home is safe. The best way to begin this task is by preparing a home safety checklist. The checklist is a great way to carefully and closely assess an entire living space and determine where potential hazards could arise.  As a presenter from the AARP noted, the best time to prepare your home for life as a senior is twenty years ago. But, he noted, the second best time to prepare your home for life as a senior is today.

David Young","2017-08-13","2017-08-13 23:14:47","It is just after 2:00 am here in Israel where I am wrapping up my travels and meetings and will begin my journey home to Iowa tomorrow. From a land that has seen the pain and deep divisions hatred has caused throughout history I wanted to acknowledge and condemn the hate and pain we have seen this weekend at home. Political discourse is something we can pride ourselves on in America - but hate is disgusting and must be condemned to the core.  ""Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness. Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them."" - 1 John 2:9-11","status",NA,NA,72,24,6,11,0,1,0,1

The apps will be judged by a panel of Iowa Third District judges who work within the academic, software, and entrepreneurial fields. And - all 3rd District participating students and teams will be invited to a special presentation of their product to the tech/entrepreneurial community at a 1 Million Cups meeting at the Des Moines Science Center in November.

For every act of heroism during a national disaster another act of piracy is waiting in the wings.  It’s heartbreaking to see people lose their lives, homes, and businesses to the ongoing flooding in Texas. But it’s despicable when scammers exploit such tragedies to appeal to your sense of generosity.  US-CERT, the US government’s chief agency responsible for detecting and minimizing cyber threats, issued an advisory on Monday warning about the proliferation of online scams aimed at those donating to ease the suffering of those afflicted by Tropical Storm Harvey.  Specifically, US-CERT warns that phishing attacks will likely be pervasive both during and after the disaster, and users are advised to be cautious of any emails and hyperlinks referencing the storm, “even if it appears to originate from a trusted source.”  “Fraudulent emails will often contain links or attachments that direct users to phishing or malware-infected websites. Emails requesting donations from duplicitous charitable organizations commonly appear after major natural disasters,” the agency says.  If you’re looking for a way to give, the FTC urges you to be cautious of potential charity scams. Do some research to ensure that your donation will go to a reputable organization that will use the money as promised.","link","https://idtaskforce-young.house.gov/scams/wise-giving-avoiding-scam-fundraising-appeals-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-harvey-and-any-disaster","idtaskforce-young.house.gov",4,1,6,0,0,0,8,1

CHCs are a proven cost-effective provider of care, saving 24 percent in total Medicaid spending when compared to other providers.   In Iowa, 180,000 Iowans rely on CHCs – and 26 million Americans nationwide – for their primary care.  However, without action by Congress to extend funding for the centers, many of these facilities will have to lay off staff or close their doors altogether. Because Iowans have shared with me how important CHCs are to their families, I partnered with three of my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to introduce the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act of 2017 to extend funding for CHCs for the next five years.   In the past three weeks, over 170 members of Congress from both parties have added their names to our bill, making this a truly bipartisan initiative. To further advocate for Iowa patients depending on CHCs I led a bipartisan letter to the leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives urging Congress to quickly take up legislation to extend funding to these centers.","link","https://davidyoung.house.gov/media-center/weeklyreport/capitol-solutions-community-based-approach-healthcare","davidyoung.house.gov",23,16,3,2,0,0,0,2

My focus has always been on middle and low income Iowans. The bill doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, increases the Child Tax Credit and preserves provisions Iowans rely on like the medical expense deduction. Students and parents will still deduct tuition and student loan interest. Iowans can spend their money better than the federal government can and soon Iowans will have more of their money to spend, save, or invest as they see fit.

In the debate over U.S. immigration policies there have been discussions on ending the practice of family-sponsored migration – also commonly referred to as chain migration. This method of immigration makes it much easier for relatives of lawful permanent residents to also acquire lawful permanent resident status in the United States. According to the Congressional Research Service, in recent years, family-sponsored/chain migration has accounted for two-thirds of all permanent immigration to the United States.
