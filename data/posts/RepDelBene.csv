He has fought so hard not only to survive, but thrive through the challenges life has already thrown at him in his 17 years of life. He will always have a ‘pre-existing condition’ that demands high quality healthcare and to think that could go away for him and many like him is criminal. The ACA isn’t perfect, but the groundwork that was laid is working for many and we simply need to sit down and figure out how to make changes to it so it works for more Americans. The answer is NOT to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions, it is NOT to reapply lifetime maximums to health plans and it is NOT to take money away from Medicaid. Having HOPE in the future has gotten Colton through many very tough days that looked gloomy and we owe it to him to have a health plan that gives him…HOPE in his future knowing that he will always get the healthcare he needs to continue to thrive and survive.”   That’s what Colton’s mother, Suzy, wrote to me today.
