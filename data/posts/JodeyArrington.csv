Congress has been advised by top intelligence officials multiple times that terrorists are targeting our refugee program to infiltrate America.

It is important that our commander in chief puts the safety of Americans first. Given concerns about the inadequate vetting of refugees and problems with our immigration system, this temporary pause is intended to ensure the safety of our citizens.

I've spent nearly two years criss-crossing twenty-nine counties in West Texas, and I can report with certainty that no law or policy has been more reviled, more destructive, or more intrusive than Obamacare. It is crushing our small businesses and main-street Americans.  The American Health Care Act repeals Obamacare and is a step in the right direction to freeing the American people from the scourge of government controlled healthcare.   For the first time since the passage of Obamacare, the American Health Care Act will lower premiums by 10%, reduce the deficit by $337 billion, and make the biggest entitlement reform in generations – saving taxpayers $883 billion. This bill strikes at the heart of Obamacare by repealing its mandates, eliminating its taxes, and gutting its regulations.   Make no mistake, this legislation is not perfect, and I will continue to fight for more conservative and fiscally responsible policy outcomes. But, when the dust settles, and the debate is over, we cannot allow perfect policy aspirations to be the enemy of good, conservative results.   My constituents sent me to Washington to tackle the tough issues and solve big problems. I committed to them that I would repeal Obamacare, and I plan to keep that promise.","status",NA,NA,74,44,7,2,0,0,0,15

I worked hard to get many of those improvements – like work requirements - included in the final bill.

You can read it here: http://politi.co/2pARFbj  Regardless, many are concerned that states will utilize waivers to deny coverage for preexisting conditions. Let me be clear, states can only obtain waivers IF they have a working high-risk pool to not only cover those with preexisting conditions, but ensure their coverage is affordable.  Again, under the American Health Care Act, you can NOT be denied coverage based on a preexisting condition, and you can NOT be charged higher based on a preexisting condition so long as you keep continuous coverage.  Like you -- for several of my colleagues who not only voted to pass the AHCA, but also helped craft its language, protecting those with preexisting conditions is personal. I encourage you to read one of their stories below:","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-son-has-a-preexisting-condition-hes-one-of-the-reasons-i-voted-for-the-ahca/2017/05/04/26c234b2-30fd-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.e96519bf30ea","washingtonpost.com",105,43,32,1,0,1,2,19

For me, as for most Americans, the images of September 11, 2001 remain seared in my memory. As a young man serving in the White House for President George W. Bush, I vividly recall the emotions of that day – first shock as I watched the two planes fly into the World Trade Center, then outrage when it became clear it was a terrorist attack, and, ultimately, profound grief for the victims and those who lost loved ones on that day.  There was no alarm; just people frantically telling us to get out fearing another plane would crash into the White House at any moment. As I got into my truck, I could see the smoke billowing from the Pentagon and jets scrambling above. Driving away, I watched people streaming out of buildings, gathering on sidewalks, and desperately trying to call their families to no avail. It was an eerie and surreal moment I’ll never forget.  For those who lost loved ones, the grief and heartache remain to this day. Not since Pearl Harbor have Americans experienced and collectively witnessed such death and destruction on our homeland. This was a defining moment for our country; one that would, like other major challenges throughout our history, try our spirits and test our resolve.  When we heard the voicemail recordings from passengers on United Flight 93, we were reminded once again that Americans are a special breed of people. Laying down their lives, the passengers on that flight refused to be paralyzed by fear and took matters into their own hands. “Let’s Roll!” became a rallying cry for our country to help lift up the families and friends of those lost, the brave first-responders who rushed headlong into danger, and all affected on that terrible day.  In the days that followed, Americans once again proved our resilience. In countless acts of selflessness, people from all walks of life pulled together to restore a great American city and comfort a broken and grieving nation. We heard a strong and compassionate Commander in Chief, who embodied America’s resolve as he stood on the rubble of the World Trade Center and declared, “I can hear you, the rest of the world can hear you, and the people who knocked down these buildings will hear all of us soon!” Perhaps more than anything, we witnessed a oneness in our country too often divided by our differences.  On that day, we were not defined by race or gender, urban or rural, Republican or Democrat, Main Street or Wall Street; we were Americans. As Americans, we don’t always agree on what is best for our country, but 9/11 is a reminder that the ties that hold our democracy together are stronger than any force that seeks to divide us.    In the wake of the Hurricane Harvey disaster, and now Hurricane Irma, we see again the very best of the American spirit where neighbors are sacrificing for neighbors without regard to ideology or color.  The blessing of such trying times is this – we discover what we’re really made of, and we’re reminded, once again, what really matters.  That may be a common human experience, but no other people collectively reflect it like Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JodeyArrington/photos/a.1845357009074724.1073741828.1844376572506101/1973276389616118/?type=3",NA,156,15,6,14,0,0,11,0

Farm income is at its lowest since the Great Depression, wages are stagnant, jobs are being shipped overseas, healthcare costs have skyrocketed, and while these families work hard and play by the rules, they never seem to get ahead. Beneath it all is a gnawing fear that plagues all who love this land – the fear that our country will be handed to our children and grandchildren less exceptional than we inherited. But, there is still hope. We have a rare chance and a small window to change the current economic trajectory.  Not since Reagan’s comprehensive tax reform in the 1980’s, have we had such an historic opportunity to empower the American people and unleash the full potential of our economy. By passing the Senate-amended budget last week, we paved the way for long-awaited tax reform that will allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, raise wages, create new jobs, and altogether improve the quality of life for West Texans and all Americans.  While the Senate’s budget fell far short of the conservative priorities we achieved in the House Budget Committee on which I serve, I agree with President Trump, this is our best opportunity to deliver on our promise of tax relief for the American people. We can't tackle the debt crisis with spending cuts alone. Increased revenue through a simpler, fairer and flatter tax system, along with deep and continual spending cuts, is ultimately the best approach to grow the economy and solve our national debt problem.","link","http://lubbockonline.com/opinion/opinion-columnists/2017-10-27/jodey-arrington-historic-tax-relief-efforts-aim-ensuring","lubbockonline.com",68,13,1,1,0,0,0,2

This legislation extends two programs vital to the sustainability of rural hospitals and the communities they serve – the Low-Volume Adjustment Program and the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program.   By extending the Medicare Low-Volume Adjustment Program for two years and, for the first time, permanently extending the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program, we can provide the assurance and continuity that our rural hospitals desperately need in order to serve our communities in the future.

Currently, disabled veterans who need special modifications to their homes, such as wheelchair ramps, are stuck in a broken system with long wait times and costly services. My bill would transfer responsibility for home adaptations from the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program to Specially Adapted Housing agents, a part of the VA that has the knowledge, experience, and capacity to speed up these construction projects, more efficiently serve our disabled veterans, and save taxpayers money.   Our veterans, especially our disabled veterans, deserve the best services that VA can provide, and this bill is another step towards doing just that.","video","https://www.facebook.com/JodeyArrington/videos/1998654070411683/",NA,75,4,10,5,0,0,0,0

Roughly 20,000 veterans are actively training or participating in these programs and their employment outcomes are nothing short of impressive.   According to VA’s data, over 90 percent of veteran apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage of over $60,000! These programs aren’t just a win for our veterans, they are a win for the taxpayer. Every dollar invested in apprenticeship programs sees a return in benefits of $35!   While it’s clear to see the advantages of apprenticeship programs, like in many parts of the VA, this program is hampered by needless burden and bureaucracy. Currently, private employers who offer these programs in more than one state have to register with each state individually. Burdened by the difficulty and trail of paperwork that this creates, many employers only choose to participate in a limited way, or to just not offer them altogether.   Today, the House passed the Veteran Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform or the VALOR Act, authored by my good friend and colleague, Rep. Ro Khanna. This bill will streamline the registration process for employers, which in turn encourages them to participate and leads to more opportunities for our veterans.    Given the tremendous sacrifice our veterans have made for our country, we should do everything we can to ensure they have access to good jobs and the VALOR Act does just that.","video","https://www.facebook.com/JodeyArrington/videos/1998722587071498/",NA,30,7,0,4,0,0,0,0

I’m grateful to President Trump and Chairman Brady for their leadership and delivering on this promised tax relief, and I look forward to witnessing a comeback of the greatest economy in the world.","link","http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-signs-republican-tax-reform-bill-2017-12","businessinsider.com",204,39,10,19,5,0,1,19

He grew up in another village. He worked in a carpenter shop until He was thirty. Then for three years He was an itinerant preacher.  ""He never owned a home. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never had a family. He never went to college. He never put His foot inside a big city. He never traveled two hundred miles from the place He was born. He never did one of the things that usually accompany greatness. He had no credentials but Himself...  ""While still a young man, the tide of popular opinion turned against him. His friends ran away. One of them denied Him. He was turned over to His enemies. He went through the mockery of a trial. He was nailed upon a cross between two thieves. While He was dying His executioners gambled for the only piece of property He had on earth – His coat. When He was dead, He was laid in a borrowed grave through the pity of a friend.  ""Nineteen long centuries have come and gone, and today He is a centerpiece of the human race and leader of the column of progress.  ""I am far within the mark when I say that all the armies that ever marched, all the navies that were ever built; all the parliaments that ever sat and all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man upon this earth as powerfully as has that one solitary life.”   - Dr. James Allen Francis","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JodeyArrington/photos/a.1870246009919157.1073741829.1844376572506101/2021518241458599/?type=3",NA,317,33,2,27,0,1,0,0
