Just days after the massive shooting at the Fort Lauderdale Airport, we learned two of our members in uniform have lost their lives while protecting and serving the public. Making this even more painful, this tragedy occurred on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. One of the police officers, a 17-year veteran with the Orlando Police Department and devoted mother, Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, was cowardly gunned down in broad daylight. As we tried to comprehend this unspeakable crime, Deputy First Class Normal Lewis died in a car accident as he joined the search for the suspect. We stand today together in support of our law enforcement family and we thank you for all your sacrifices and hard work. The loss of these exceptional law enforcement officers reminds us of the urgency to stand up against gun violence by pushing to pass stricter gun laws to make our communities safer in Florida and across our Nation"". -Congressman Darren Soto","status",NA,NA,6,2,0,0,0,0,5,0

This is contrary to American values and Trump's own campaign‚Äôs promises.    Congressman Soto is holding this meeting to create a study group on the challenges faced by lesbian transgender, gay, bisexual and queer people in the 9th District, and to begin the process of creating an Advisory Council to advance his work in support of the LGBTQ community in the District. The study group will report back in 60 days.

During the last 100 years, Puerto Ricans have changed the course of American History. We served with distinction in our U.S. military including our heroic Borinqueneers who fought bravely in WWI, WWII, and the Korean War, and we continue to serve in the military in great numbers.   We have pioneering doctors like our first Hispanic and first female U.S. Surgeon General, Antonia Novello. Sports greats like Roberto Clemente, Ivan Rodr√≠guez, Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada have impressed the American people on the baseball field.  Science teacher Joe Acaba soared to new heights as an astronaut.    Entertainers such as Jennifer L√≥pez, Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin, Willie Col√≥n, Tito Nieves and Lin-Manuel Miranda have thrilled audiences across the world.  And of course, Sonia Sotomayor who now sits on the United States Supreme Court. These and many other Puerto Rican heroes have instilled amazing historic and cultural contributions throughout our nation including changing the face of major cities such as New York, Chicago, and Orlando.    This history has also been an emotional one.  To date, our brothers and sisters on the Island do not enjoy the same rights as we in the Diaspora. La Isla del Encanto is still experiencing a terrible depression. And we in the United States Congress must step up to help bring prosperity and equality to Puerto Rico.    I am honored to serve on the Subcommittees on Oversight and Insular Lands with jurisdiction to review major Puerto Rico issues related to PROMESA, federal lands, and status issues. I will continue to work with my fellow Members of Congress to reduce the Island‚Äôs debt, bring relief directly to Puerto Ricans living on the Island, and fight for new economic opportunities there.  I will also closely monitor the upcoming plebiscite and will respect the will of the people with regard to status.
