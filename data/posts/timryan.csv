This is a disastrous decision. It hurts places like Ohio, where the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy economy could bring jobs back to our communities. It hurts our planet by once again continuing to ignore the perils of global climate change. And finally it hurts our national security.

They can tinker around the edges all they want, but it won‚Äôt change the fact that Trumpcare is nothing more than a massive tax cut for the wealthiest among us, financed on the backs of the elderly, people with preexisting conditions, and the poor. Any genuine attempt to improve our healthcare system should be about two things ‚Äì how do we reduce costs and expand coverage? Trumpcare achieves the exact opposite results. It increases costs for most Americans and decreases the number of people insured. This is not what the American people signed up for.  I am particularly dismayed at their disingenuous inclusion of $45 billion to fight opioid addiction. This money should normally be a welcomed lifeline to communities in desperate need of Federal assistance if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that this bill guts Medicaid, the single largest provider of addiction treatment and recovery services, by $772 billion. This legislation remains a cruel betrayal of the American people.

Trump and Republican leaders‚Äô long-awaited tax plan falls far short of the meaningful reform hardworking Americans need and deserve. Instead of fixing our broken tax system, their idea of ‚Äòreform‚Äô relies on the same supply-side, trickle-down economics that has failed American families for decades. Despite years of lectures from Republicans about fiscal responsibility, the plan released today would cost the U.S. as much as $5 trillion over the next 10 years. Their plan is clear: slash rates for the wealthiest among us, who have already seen the vast majority of our economic recovery, and stick the middle class with the check.  In the past, I have said that Republicans and Democrats have an opportunity to work together on tax reform. I even extended an olive branch, stating for the record that I support reducing the corporate tax rate as long as it is coupled with closing the special interest loopholes that allow one out of five Fortune 500 companies to pay nothing in taxes and increasing the tax on capital gains and dividends so that the real ‚Äòowners‚Äô of the business are held accountable. But after today‚Äôs announcement, it is clear that President Trump and Congressional Republicans have no interest in real, bipartisan reform that will help everyday Americans. Instead their tax plan demonstrates that they are only interested in creating a tax structure that benefits themselves and their wealthy donors. We won‚Äôt stand for that. These tax breaks for the 1% would blow a massive hole in our deficit and would mean drastic cuts to important programs that give a much needed hand-up to hardworking families who need a fair shot at the American Dream.  The American people deserve better. This is not a plan I will support.","link","https://nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html","nytimes.com",105,74,26,2,1,0,14,43

The internet is an indispensable part of American life and it should be classified in a way that reflects the world we live in today. The effort to repeal net neutrality is a glaring example of the Republican Party siding with multinational corporations and big business over the interests of the American people.

The same goes with the inadequate disaster relief supplemental aid legislation, which was woefully insufficient. The Governor of Puerto Rico previously requested $94 billion just for its recovery efforts, but this measure only provided $81 billion to be split between Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It also included an unacceptably low amount of funding to combat the ever-growing opioid epidemic. There were 63,600 overdose deaths in 2016, far more than the 58,000 deaths in the entire Vietnam War.
