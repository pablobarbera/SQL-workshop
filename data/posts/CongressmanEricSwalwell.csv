Unlike traditional DNA analysis, which can take weeks, Rapid DNA analysis permits processing of samples in approximately 90 minutes or less.  As an Alameda County prosecutor, I learned all too well that a DNA backlog leaves crimes unsolved, leaves the public unprotected, and leaves victims crying out for justice – none of which are acceptable.

President Trump's recent ban of persons entering the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries violates who we are as a welcoming, diverse country. I hope you will consider reviewing this cruel policy and how it affects our region, your workforce, and our global economy.   The congressional district I represent and in which your company does business, California's 15th, is one of the most diverse parts of the United States. It would be hard to find a large employer in our area who has not benefited from the skills of an immigrant workforce or customer base. Particularly, the East Bay is home to thousands of Muslims, many of whom immigrated -- either on visas or as refugees -- to the East Bay from a Muslim-majority country. While their backgrounds and journeys are different, most immigrants are resilient, are devoted to their new home, and work hard to provide for themselves and their family. It is this spirit of the immigrant that fuels so many companies in our area.   President Trump's ban threatens our diversity and economic productivity. If it is not reversed, our region -- and America -- will suffer cultural and economic consequences. Culturally, it will be used to sow divisions between Muslims in America and people of other faiths and backgrounds. Economically, having a ban will limit where we can draw upon for talent across the world -- not only from the countries banned, but also from people we wish to attract globally who will now fear they could be kicked out of our country because of how they worship. Ninety-six companies, including Apple, Facebook, and Uber, recently signed onto an amicus brief opposing this ban, recognizing its harmful effect on our country and our people.  Our national security is my highest priority. I worked as a prosecutor for Alameda County for seven years and now serve as the senior Democrat who oversees the Central Intelligence Agency. This ban does not make us more safe; it makes us less safe. It alienates our allies who have taken hundreds of thousands of refugees and who we depend upon for cooperation in the fight against terrorism. And worse, it motivates the enemy to inspire new terrorists to carry out attacks against the United States and our allies, under the message that we are not welcoming to Muslims. We can continue to keep our country safe with the vetting processes already in place without sacrificing our welcoming nature and the economic benefits it reaps.    It is my hope you will consider the consequences this ban has for our region and country. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.   All my best, Eric Swalwell Member of Congress","status",NA,NA,229,54,11,25,0,0,0,0

Questions remain about whether he made such contact of his own volition or on orders; whether Trump administration officials were misled about the contact or lied to cover it up; and whether Flynn might’ve been susceptible to Russian blackmail, as the Justice Department reportedly informed the White House late last month.   Flynn’s contacts with the Russian Ambassador are part of a larger pattern of Russian involvement with and support for Trump and his team before and since the 2016 election. That’s why I and Rep. Elijah Cummings co-authored H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act.

More troubling is that Chairman Nunes chose instead to brief the President and his team, days after it was learned that the President's campaign is under criminal investigation.   The House Intelligence Committee is charged with investigating Russia's interference into our election and whether any U.S. persons were involved. The Chairman's actions and closeness to a President whose campaign is under federal investigation have gravely damaged the Investigation's credibility.   The American people deserve to know what happened in the 2016 election and what America's leaders can do to make sure it never happens again. More than ever, the only way to redeem our democracy is to have an independent, bipartisan commission, as provided by H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act. The entire Democratic caucus has sponsored this bill and so has one Republican – now it’s time for the rest of the GOP to put country over party and call for an investigation that can rise above the growing perception of political bias.","link","https://swalwell.house.gov/issues/now-what","swalwell.house.gov",1225,265,475,23,2,88,12,316

The American public needs a full accounting of Russian interference in the 2016 election; of American cooperation in that meddling, if any; and of administration efforts to impede investigations into the meddling and collusion, if they took place. The House and Senate intelligence committees are working on aspects of all that, and those must continue. But a full accounting is likely to emerge only if Congress appoints a special commission like the one that investigated the 9/11 attacks. With the Trump administration having led the way, Congress too should act.""","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-special-counsel-is-essential-but-congress-isnt-off-the-hook/2017/05/17/23c8baa8-3b4b-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.7edbd686b973","washingtonpost.com",236,25,31,3,0,0,1,1

We have high confidence in these judgments.”  -- the entire U.S. intelligence community  “There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever. The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts.”  -- James Comey, former FBI Director  ""I believe the Russians will absolutely continue to try to conduct influence operations in the US, which will include cyber intrusions.”  -- Bill Priestap, assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division  ""As of right now, we have evidence that election-related systems in 21 states were targeted."" -- Acting Deputy Undersecretary of Cybersecurity at U.S. Department of Homeland Security  “Russia is a full-scope cyber actor that will remain a major threat to US Government, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure. Moscow has a highly advanced offensive cyber program, and in recent years, the Kremlin has assumed a more aggressive cyber posture. This aggressiveness was evident in Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 US election, and we assess that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the 2016 US election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets.” -- Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats  “Russia's influence activities in the run-up to the 2016 election constituted the high water mark of their long running efforts since the 1960s to disrupt and influence our elections. They must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations with a minimal expenditure of resource. And I believe they are now emboldened to continue such activities in the future both here and around the world, and to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the very foundation of our democratic political system, this episode is it.” -- Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper  ""It is his duty, President Trump's, to be skeptical of Russia. It's his duty to investigate and defend our country against a cyber offensive because Russia is our most dangerous adversary in the world today. And if he continues to refuse to act it's a dereliction of the basic duty to defend the country."" -- Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns  “In 2016, the Russian government, at the direction of Vladimir Putin himself, orchestrated cyberattacks on our nation for the purpose of influencing our election — plain and simple.” -- former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson  ""I'm 1,000 percent certain that the Russians interfered in our election.""  -- U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.  “It's the Russians who are trying, who tried to destroy the very fundamental of democracy, and that is to change the outcome of an American election.”  -- U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-AZ  ““There’s no question there was a very serious effort made by Mr. Putin and his government, his organization, to interfere in major ways with our basic fundamental democratic processes.”  -- former Vice President Dick Cheney","link","http://www.politico.eu/article/president-donald-trump-nobody-knows-if-russia-interfered-in-us-election/","politico.eu",684,192,358,42,17,21,14,227

And it means examining our own actions and our own beliefs. That may be the hardest to do -- but if we do it, it will make the greatest difference if we all do it.   I'll give you an example...A few years ago, at the genesis of Black Lives Matter, I remember people trying to amend the concept to, ""all lives matter.""  And reflexively, I thought, yeah that makes sense. Who would disagree with that? And I was confused when Black Lives Matter organizers would react strongly against someone countering their work by saying ""all lives matter."" I sought to understand their concern. I learned that for black people in America, because of the history of slavery, police misconduct against them, to discrimination still experienced today, that only when we all acknowledge that Black Lives Matter, can all lives matter. They're right. BLACK LIVES MATTER. We should all care about that. And fight for them every single day.","status",NA,NA,530,73,45,91,0,0,10,1

Traditional DNA analysis can take weeks, but Rapid DNA analysis permits processing of samples in about 90 minutes or less. The technology revolutionizes the way in which those arrested for crimes are enrolled in the criminal justice system; shortens the time required for their DNA to be linked to unsolved crimes; and speeds up innocent people’s exoneration.   The Rapid DNA Act will let local law enforcement agencies – under standards and guidelines established by the FBI – perform real-time DNA testing at the time of arrest within their own booking stations, comparing samples to profiles in the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).  This law’s enactment proves that, even in troubled political times, we can work together across the aisle to make Americans safer. As a former prosecutor, a son and brother of police officers, and a Judiciary Committee member, I’m excited that this new law will help law enforcement agencies across the nation use a more powerful tool to protect and serve our communities, to clear the innocent, and to attain justice for victims.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanEricSwalwell/photos/a.450987164956393.118619.450130878375355/1483237005064732/?type=3",NA,230,32,11,14,0,5,0,0

It’s not just that he showed blatant disregard for the rule of law by pardoning Arpaio, who has an appalling record of racism and contempt of federal court. He also went outside the usual process that ensures fairness in applying the pardon power, including ignoring Justice Department policy that calls for a five-year waiting period and requiring the applicant to express regret or remorse. And it’s all complicated by his earlier having asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to drop the criminal case against Arpaio, a clear effort to politicize the administration of justice.

The bill would prohibit sale of “bump stocks,” a kind of accessory for semi-automatic rifles. A bump stock lets the shooter fire at a rate of 400 to 800 rounds per minute, replicating the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon that propels multiple bullets with a single trigger pull.   Stephen Paddock, who massacred dozens last Sunday in Las Vegas, reportedly used bump stocks. It’s amazing to me that these devices – clearly intended to skirt our laws against fully automatic weapons – were ever allowed on the market, but banning them now would be a good first step.   Next, let’s listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want truly universal background checks for gun purchases, and let’s ban high-capacity magazines that make it easier to kill more people faster.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/politics/gun-laws-magazines-las-vegas/index.html","cnn.com",631,110,64,37,2,5,1,1

It called for an increase in the minimum wage and comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship which will boost the economy, extend Social Security’s solvency, and reduce budget deficits. And it supported funding all types of infrastructure.  But not a single House Republican voted for that plan.   Instead, House Republicans approved a budget that paves the way for handing tax breaks to billionaires on the backs of seniors and hard-working Americans. It will add trillions to the deficit while cutting Medicaid by $1.1 trillion and Medicare by $487 billion over the next 10 years.

Last election, Russia attacked our democracy, infecting us with a virus we have still not kicked. The only antidote to a future attack is unity in identifying how we were so vulnerable and who was responsible. These partisan investigations only create disunity among our nation’s leaders and will serve to sharpen Russians’ swords to attack us again.  The House and Senate Intelligence committees and Special Counsel Robert Muller must be allowed finish our investigations without further delay or distraction. But as insurance, Congress also must be allowed to vote on my bill – H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act – to create an independent, bipartisan-appointed commission that can investigate Russia’s meddling free of all of this political pandering and obfuscation.","link","https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-10-24/house-intel-chair-devin-nunes-launches-investigation-of-uranium-deal","usnews.com",272,190,75,10,14,5,29,189

This bill is a disaster especially for California, which faces the largest net tax increase of any state, at $12.1 billion.
