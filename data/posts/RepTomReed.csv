These reforms will lower premiums and increase access to quality health care while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion and taxes by $880 billion. As promised, the American Health Care Act will rescue our collapsing health care system, provide tax relief for middle-income families and business owners, and give Americans the opportunity to save more of their hard earned money. I care about ensuring a stable transition as we fulfill our promise to the American people and deliver long awaited access to truly affordable and sustainable health care.”  Importantly, this report has not factored into plans by Congress and the President to reinvigorate free market competition which will drive costs down even further and open up additional opportunities for flexibility, benefits, choice, and savings.","status",NA,NA,41,202,21,2,14,1,5,69

Today, we have released a framework of our objectives. Our goal is to create good paying, high-quality jobs while cutting taxes for the middle class. This can be done through incentivizing the manufacturing sector and small business growth, as well as lowering rates on businesses and investments. This path will ensure that hard-working folks of our region, and across America, have more money in their pockets. It is time we in DC think outside the box, no ideas are off the table.
