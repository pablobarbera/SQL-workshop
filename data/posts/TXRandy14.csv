Congressional leadership, the White House, the House Freedom Caucus, and my fellow House colleagues worked tirelessly to provide relief from the burdensome federal mandates of Obamacare. I am deeply appreciative of the time and attention given during the negotiations, and for the pro-market, sensible changes that came about because of them. However, the government does not belong in the health care industry. The best solution to fix the failure of Obamacare is patient-centered, physician-supported, market-based health care.   I am grateful to Speaker Ryan for giving us more time to thoughtfully deliberate on a real solution. Americans need more freedom of choice in their insurance plans. States need more power to decide their participation. Households need lower premiums. While certainly improved, AHCA is not quite there.

Brian Babin, regional leaders, and I went on a flyover of the area where the coastal barrier (Ike Dike) would be constructed.

The continued rain, wind, and flooding are affecting restoration efforts.  Electricity providers are working around the clock to restore power to Texans.   As with any weather event, please be mindful of the following safety tips: 1.     Live wires can be deadly. Stay away from downed power lines. Call 1-800-9OUTAGE or 1-800-968-8243 to report downed or dangling power lines, poles or other damaged equipment. 2.     Do not trim trees or remove debris on or near downed power lines. Only power company crews or their contractors should remove trees or limbs touching power lines. 3.     Keep away from the immediate areas where crews are working. There is always the danger of moving equipment and the possibility of construction materials or limbs or overhead wires falling to the ground. 4.     If you plan on using a generator for temporary power, get a licensed electrician and disconnect from the utility electric system before hooking up to your home main electric panel.  5.     Do not run a generator in a confined space without adequate ventilation. 6.     Avoid using candles or other flammable devices to warm your home.  7.     Try to stay off the roads. More traffic in bad weather leads to more accidents, including more injuries and fatalities as well as accidents that can damage electrical poles and other equipment, creating outages and impeding the ability of crews to access and repair damage and slowing restoration. 8. If rising flood waters enter your property, shut off all breakers until it is safe to turn them back on.","status",NA,NA,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

Everything culminated with this – the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  This House and Senate embraced the extraordinary opportunity to fix a broken system and relieve the undue burden of costly taxes from so many Americans. In reforming the tax code, we lower taxes for all Americans by reducing every single tax bracket. The standard deduction has nearly doubled for everyone. With lower taxes across the board, businesses, both large and small, will be better able to foster job creation, wage growth, and competitiveness.  What does all of this mean? It means more of your hard-earned money in your pocket. It means more jobs created. It means a fairer and simpler tax code. This is a tax cut for all Americans. It is pro-family. It is pro-growth.  I applaud Chairman Kevin Brady, the Ways and Means Committee, the Conferees, and everyone who worked tirelessly to ensure Americans see lower taxes in the new year.
