The study proves that, while in office, President Obama regularly exceeded the authority granted to him by the U.S. Constitution, bypassing the proper lawmaking process to push his agenda. State attorneys general were on the front lines over the last eight years keeping the federal government in check when it ignored the law and exceeded it‚Äôs authority. The Courts had to rein-in the Obama administration more than any President in the last 70 years, and if it weren‚Äôt for state attorneys general asserting the rights of their states, the Obama administration would have had even greater success in pushing unlawful policies.

I hand delivered the following letter:  Congratulations on being nominated as the next United States Trade Representative (USTR). Serving as USTR is a great honor and I look forward to working with you to expand opportunities in foreign markets for Montana agriculture, ensure Montana‚Äôs lumber mills can compete on a level-playing field, and reduce barriers for Montana manufacturing exports. I also invite you to Montana to visit with producers and manufacturers from across the state.    Ensuring that Montana producers are treated fairly in foreign markets is critical to Montana jobs and our economy. Unfortunately, unfair restrictions are often placed on many Montana goods. For example, China limits Montana ranchers‚Äô ability to sell beef into its market, Canada discriminates against U.S. wheat within its grading system, and Japan imposes unfair foreign taxes on Montana barley. I urge you to prioritize these issues, enforce existing trade agreements, and work to reduce foreign tax and regulatory barriers facing Montana producers and manufacturers as they compete for the 95% of the world‚Äôs consumers that live outside of the United States.    Another critical issue is the ongoing softwood lumber dispute with Canada. Over the past generation, harvests on federal forests in Montana are down over 70%, the number of Montana mills has fallen from 30 to eight, and we have seen a 40% reduction in the wood products workforce. While excessive regulations and chronic litigation from fringe groups are largely responsible for this decline, unfairly subsidized Canadian softwood lumber imports have also had a significant impact on Montana jobs. I urge you to work to establish a fair and effective softwood lumber agreement with Canada. If that does not occur and as the related U.S. industry trade case moves forward, please support and utilize appropriate trade remedies to the greatest extent possible. Congratulations again on your nomination, and I look forward to continuing to dialogue with you and your administration, as well as hosting you in Montana.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SteveDainesMT/photos/a.189055717905719.58687.185361254941832/1057986104346005/?type=3",NA,59,30,3,0,0,0,0,9

Delicious Bakery is located below our Bozeman office and is owned and run by Carl McCauley and Fran Zelenitz from Bozeman.  They have been in business for about a year.  Carl is an Army Veteran who has made multiple deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa.  Fran is a professional Baker and met with Carl while working in a bike shop.  They built their business together with several friends who helped with construction.  The bakery is known as a safe haven for veterans who are in need of a cup of coffee, a meal, or help finding employment.

The foundation has set up fire funds for those affected by the Lolo Peak fire, and the Seely Lake and Rice Ridge fires.  Red Crosses throughout the state are also setting up shelters and taking donations for those in need.  And if you or someone you know is affected by a fire, the Montana Department of Agriculture has launched the Agriculture Fire and Drought Assistance Hotline.  This hotline will connect those affected with local resources and programs to help them get through this tough time.  The hotline can also answer questions about hay and feed donations, livestock, fencing and transportation.  The hotline number is 1-844-515-1571.
