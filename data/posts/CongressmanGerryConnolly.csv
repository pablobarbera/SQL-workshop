Even more troublesome, his attempt to tap dance around the Emoluments Clause is an affront to the American public.

I have spoken personally with VA Inspector General Michael Missal to convey my grave concerns, share my constituents’ experiences, and offer my assistance. I join the House Veterans Affairs Committee (HVAC) to demand hearings on this matter. We have a sacred obligation to ensure that the men and women who sacrifice so much to defend our freedoms receive the highest quality care and services. But this report reveals that our local medical center has failed to meet that standard by a mile. Critical personnel vacancies, unsanitary conditions, and empty supply shelves are just a few of the severe issues that have plagued this facility. We owe it our veterans to not only address these problems, but also to understand how they were allowed to arise in the first place. This week my office visited the DC VAMC to learn what steps Acting Director Larry Connell is taking to resolve this crisis. His team has stated that they are working to fill critical vacancies, implement a new inventory management system, and carry out a supply surge. I will remain engaged with the VAOIG, the DC VAMC staff, and the HVAC to ensure that we turn our local facility into the state-of-the-art medical center that our veterans deserve and that such abhorrent conditions never occur again.","status",NA,NA,56,8,4,0,0,0,0,0

It is a blueprint for social Darwinism and a unilateral retreat from our commitments at home and abroad.  How does slashing Medicaid, Medicare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Social Security, disability insurance, NIH funding, SNAP, community development block grants, foreign assistance, and public health and safety programs make America Great Again?  It won't.  The President’s budget makes mindless cuts to so many programs we know work. It cuts $800 billion from Medicaid over the next decade, ripping away health care from millions of low-income Americans. It slashes SNAP by $193 billion, even more than the unconscionable cuts proposed by Republicans in recent years. It guts foreign assistance programs, threatening our security and shirking our global commitments. It disinvests in the National Institutes of Health, crippling our ability to find the cures of tomorrow. The President would begin to hand over public education to private charter schools, and eliminate federal student loan support. And this plan would make many public health and environmental protections obsolete.  The consequences of this budget would be disproportionately harmful to Northern Virginia. While we can take solace that PRIIA funding is included, this budget threatens other funding sources for Metro and could grind to a halt the progress we've made in restoring our nation's transit system. It eliminates funding for the Chesapeake Bay program. It eliminates climate science research. It eliminates community development block grants our localities rely on. And the President’s budget is yet another attack on federal employees and retirees by cutting their retirement benefits and pay. In fact, the biggest losers of the President’s budget will be the millions of Americans that rely on the federal government to care for our veterans, maintain our national parks, and process Social Security checks each and every day. Cuts of this magnitude will make it impossible to recruit and retain the qualified workforce we need to meet our nation's challenges.  The President’s proposal finances tax cuts for the rich, a ramp up in defense spending, and his fantasy border wall with austerity measures on domestic investments in education, infrastructure, and research – investments we should prioritize, not eliminate. It's a dystopian vision that will inflict the very carnage he described in his inaugural jeremiad.  https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1001","link","https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1001","connolly.house.gov",77,24,27,1,0,2,15,38

Matsui and Paul D. Tonko in condemning the Trump Administration's decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan. Our full statement:   “While increasingly violent storms hammer communities in the South and wildfires force evacuations in the West, the Trump Administration continues to unwind federal action on climate change — putting the costs of inaction on homeowners, businesses and taxpayers. By repealing the Clean Power Plan, which would finally put limits on carbon pollution from power plants, the Trump Administration is abandoning US climate leadership and leaving Americans at greater risk.  “The painful costs of unmitigated climate change are steep and growing. Recent storms Harvey, Irma and Maria brought untold tragedy to countless families, many of whom lost their homes and their loved ones. While Americans will certainly rebuild, we also know that not addressing climate change and its role in creating more frequent and more severe storms and droughts means these costs will only grow. Asking Americans to have to rebuild repeatedly just isn’t sustainable.  “Keeping the Clean Power Plan in place, on the other hand, would help protect Americans from the worst impacts of climate change, improve public health by reducing pollution, and spur innovation and job creation in the clean energy economy. There is an opportunity here to act on climate change and make America a global leader in the next century—President Trump and Administrator Pruitt are just missing it.”  https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1167","link","https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1167","connolly.house.gov",34,16,0,0,1,0,1,0

Here are some inconvenient facts:   Fact: VA10, where Speaker Ryan is holding his tax plan town hall, ranks as the 6th highest congressional district claiming the SALT deduction. 51.7% of VA10 constituents would no longer be able to claim this deduction.   Fact: Northern Virginia residents would be disproportionately hit by the Trump/Ryan plan that caps mortgage interest deduction. Loudoun County has the largest average deduction in the county at $6,365.  Fact: Loudoun County, Fairfax County and Falls Church are all in the Top 10 in the country for claiming the mortgage interest deduction according to the Tax Foundation.  Fact: The GOP tax plan would eliminate the student loan interest deduction, which more than 11.4 million students and parents claimed in 2014.   Fact: Trump tax plan would eliminate the deduction for medical and dental expenses, which would be catastrophic for the sickest and most vulnerable among us.

The GOP plan caps the state and local income deduction. It caps the mortgage interest deduction.  And it phases out the medical cost deduction. Our district, where 50 percent of tax filers claim a SALT deduction, is one of the top congressional districts in the nation affected by this change, and 75 percent of our district’s SALT claimants are in the middle income tax brackets. 144,000 of my constituents claim the mortgage interest deduction, for an average savings of $2,946. These changes would be a devastating double whammy to Northern Virginia families.  This bill falls far short of our values. It would raise taxes on tens of millions of middle class Americans in order to finance permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. By 2027, the Tax Policy Foundation projects more than half of households would face a tax increase. It explodes the deficit by nearly $1.5 trillion. And the conference report adds a devastating attack on the American healthcare system by repealing the individual mandate, leaving 13 million more Americans uninsured.  Congress had a real opportunity to pursue bipartisan revenue neutral tax reform that would lower corporate rates and benefit the middle class. As a leader of the New Democrat Coalition, I have written on several occasions to Speaker Ryan and Chairman Brady asking them to partner with us on a tax reform plan that would simplify the tax code, create revenue for infrastructure, and provide middle class tax relief. Instead, the majority has ignored these repeated overtures and rushed through a partisan tax plan that asks working families, veterans, and low-income seniors to pay higher tax rates than the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations. That’s simply unconscionable.  https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1216","link","https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1216","connolly.house.gov",110,43,31,1,0,2,16,45

We should be elevating the work of USAID and the role of the USAID Administrator at the national security table.

Raskin, Cummings, and 95 of our colleagues in reminding House leadership that the federal workforce is not a national piggy bank. For too long Congress has slashed federal employee pay and benefits to offset new or increased spending. We can all agree that a long-term budget agreement is necessary to lift the crippling spending caps enacted under sequestration. However, it is high time we remember the federal workforce’s service and selflessness in the face of challenging budgetary circumstances over the past few years. We cannot allow any spending agreement to cut the federal workforce’s hard-earned pay and benefits to offset the costs of lifting the spending caps.
