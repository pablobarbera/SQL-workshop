Energy experts agree improving grid efficiency and reliability require investing in energy research. ARPA-E is one energy research program that can help reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and maintain U.S. leadership in the global energy sector---but the President’s budget blueprint and the Republican spending bill that passed the House in June both eliminate it. UC San Diego received $15 million in ARPA-E grants over the last five years including funding for projects to increase grid security and efficiency. Last year, Achates Power in Sorrento Valley received $9 million to develop more efficient combustion engines. Secretary Perry agreed we shouldn’t cut ARPA-E, and even suggested he would keep the program if it were up to him. I hope we can find a way to protect this important investment in energy innovation.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepScottPeters/videos/1686479638089413/",NA,76,9,6,4,0,0,0,0
