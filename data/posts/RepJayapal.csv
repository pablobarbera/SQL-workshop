He said things that sounded good, but they were the opposite of his actions and rhetoric of the past.   He repeated falsehoods about immigrants to justify the logic behind his inhumane and barbaric executive orders that have thrown our immigration system into complete and utter chaos. Instead of offering specifics and a plan to expand health care for all, President Trump, once again, called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act leaving millions without health insurance. He talked about tax relief for the middle class, but the Trump tax plan is nothing more than a big tax break for the rich. He mentioned reducing poverty, but in fact his budget blueprint would decimate the very social safety net programs that help people climb out of poverty.   It was surreal to listen to President Trump talk about ‚Äòdraining the swamp‚Äô after he‚Äôs appointed billionaires, lobbyists and Washington-insiders to top posts in his cabinet.   I firmly believe that we‚Äôre all better off when we‚Äôre all better off. We need to shift our focus from fear mongering to creating jobs, expanding health care for all, protecting our planet for our children. Tonight, we got few specifics for any real plans and a slightly softer version of the divisive Trump agenda.","status",NA,NA,46,11,8,6,0,0,0,3

It is deeply disturbing that Donald Trump has refused to release his tax returns or create a blind trust for the proceeds of his assets. There is no wall erected between his businesses and his public office and anyone who wants to buy influence can simply do so openly.   Trump's entire presidency can be seen as a promotion of his business interests and be used by domestic and foreign governments to curry favor and produce benefit to his personal empire.

As a leader in establishing Seattle‚Äôs sanctuary policies over 14 years ago, this ruling is a huge validation of our work to protect immigrant rights, public safety and our Constitution.‚Äù   ‚ÄúThe facts are that sanctuary cities are safer than non-sanctuaries because sanctuary policies allow local police to maintain trust and working relationships with immigrant communities.

Crisis that can tear us apart or draw us together in refusing to allow for a hierarchy of oppression. If we did not understand the importance of pulling together, broadening our coalitions, organizing on the ground and building the intersections among us before, perhaps the one thing Trump has done for us is show us what it takes to win, and how completely and totally dependent we all are on one another.   Intersectionality is a clunky word for the basic idea that economic justice, immigrant justice, racial justice and gender justice are inseparable ‚Äì they‚Äôre not each in silos. The different kinds of oppression we face overlap with one another. It‚Äôs not about figuring out which is worse, it‚Äôs about taking on all of them and leaving no one behind.

We cannot pick and choose. Democrats cannot lambaste Trump and Moore, and then turn a blind eye to our own who face credible charges against them.   No one ever wants to believe that someone they respect and have regarded as a champion for civil rights issues would abuse their power to harm and harass women. On top of that, sexism colors everything. Women just aren‚Äôt generally believed. Period. Even more complicated is that sexual harassment is extremely difficult to prove in any court of law. That means that efforts to stop harassment must recognize that there will be gray areas. Women will come forward and men will deny. The question is: What is society‚Äôs response? To truly change norms and cultures, we need to start believing women from the get-go.     Our country and these individual women have been failed by a congressional sexual harassment complaint and investigation system that silences women and leads men to believe that they can get away with this behavior. That must change.   The actions and subsequent deflections from the growing tide of sexual harassment cases in Congress not only hurt individual women, but they undermine our institution of democracy. For justice to be done in cases with substantial evidence, a simple denial is not sufficient; the relinquishment of power becomes essential.

I am so familiar with the amazing work that our community health centers in urban areas do with low-income and immigrant populations, and I know all the numbers about the role that community health centers play in rural areas across the country. On Friday, I got to see it in action: timely, excellent medical care. Real jobs in rural communities. Cheaper care for everyone so that people don't have to go to emergency rooms and have important preventative care too. Our community health centers play an essential role in urban and rural communities. And it is so short-sighted that Republicans in Congress have refused to reauthorize long term funding for community health centers and CHIP - it threatens both healthcare for rural and low-income areas and could result in 60,000 jobs lost. The spending bill passed just before Christmas was kicking the can down the road for another month and giving no certainty to these important programs. I'm grateful for the excellent care I received, and will do all I can to fight for stable funding for these community health centers.","status",NA,NA,96,10,8,9,0,0,1,1

I put together a stack of books to bring with me and I dive in. Back by popular demand since everyone is asking me for it again, here's my stack with little descriptions of why I am excited about each!   Thanks to my friend and book whisperer Rick Simonson at the most amazing bookstore in the world, Elliott Bay Books, for helping me put much of the stack together!    Read, read, read! It is so important to enter into other worlds and be nurtured with deeper understanding, and creative, generative, artistic energy. And support your independent booksellers!  The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, Arundhati Roy--well, I LOVED God of Small Things. I'm almost done with this one and it's been an adventure. Goes into Hindutva and Kashmiri politics this time, as well as beautifully drawn, sometimes riveting characters.  Whereas, by Layli Long Soldier:  This book of poetry is unbelievable.  I am halfway through and I cannot say enough. Long Soldier explores language and diction and history, including the history of the Dakota 38--compelling and heartbreaking. The whole second half of the book (it's not long) is about the Congressional Resolution of Apology to Native Americans that was apparently signed in 2009 by Barack Obama without a tribal leader in the room.   The Longest Trail: Writings on American Indian History, Culture and Politics, a collection of Alvin Josephy's writings edited by my good friend Rich Wandschneider and Marc Jaffe. I had the honor of meeting Josephy once at Fishtrap and have read snippets from Rich's writings over the years. Now in Congress, I'm looking to deepen my understanding and this one is going to be a winner, I know.  No Time to Spare, by Ursula LeGuin:  I love Ursula. I love her fiction and I adore her essays. She is a trailblazer in so many ways and a beautiful, sharp, sassy human being. She was an early writing mentor to me--encouraged me to write fiction, read my stories, gave me feedback. I kept all those stories with her comments and I hope someday to make her proud by publishing them. I can't wait to read this latest collection.  Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders: Listened to the NPR interview with him and was captivated then, listening to a short story writer describe writing a novel. My husband Steve Williamson is partway through this but I am going to steal it back!  Tell Me How It Ends, by Valeria Luiselli: As someone who has spent the last 15 years working on immigration, looking forward to this essay which is ""an indictment of our treatment of undocumented children, a reckoning with our culpability for the dangers they are fleeing, and a damning confrontation between the ideas of the American dream and the reality of American racism and fear.""  The Line Becomes a River, by Francisco Cantu:  Another immigration book about the border. Given all the talk these days, there is so much that needs to be said about what is TRUE on the border.    The Battle for Home, by Marwa al-Sabouni: We have so much to learn about the damage we cause with our wars. Here's an eye-witness account from a young architect in Syria.   Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Shaping Worlds, by Adrienne Maree Brown:  Anything that says Inspired by Octavia Butler has me! This is a ""radical self-help, society-help and planet-help"" book with some specific tips for change-making.  Looked interesting!  Home Fire, by Kamila Shamsie:  I wanted to like this book. It's worth reading but I will say it felt a bit overdone to me. Still, it's an important exploration of families torn themselves by terrorism and about redemption and identity. I'd still recommend it.  Countdown, edited by my friend and environmental champion Paul Hawken. Looking forward to reading this, ""the most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming."" A collection of the best ideas, research and science to help us preserve our planet and reverse global warming.  Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War, & The Refugees, two books by Viet Thanh Nguyen:  A National Book Award Finalist, these books are follow ups to his first AMAZING novel, The Sympathizers, which I finished just about a month ago. If you haven't read that one, read it! There's too much possibility of war in the world today under Donald Trump, and it seems right to understand more about our past wars from this remarkable brilliant writer.  I love this phrase from the back cover: ""All wars are fought twice, the first time on the battlefield, the second time in memory.""  Exit West, by Mohsin Hamid:  I have been waiting to read this one! Called by the New York Times ""one of his generation's most innovative and gifted writers,"" this is a love story set amidst rubble, about magical doors and harsh realities of the choices facing refugees.  Sing, Unburied, Sing, by Jesmyn Ward:  I read her first book Salvage the Bones, and loved it.  Set in rural Mississippi, I imagine she will take on past and present, hope and struggle as only she can do.  Also, not pictured here because they are on my Kindle (I do have one, very useful for my long airplane rides):  Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow: part-way through and just a must read.   Garden of Evening Mists, by Tan Twan Eng:  His first book, The Gift of Rain, is one of the most gorgeously written novels I have ever read, set in Malaysia.  You just get lost in his prose. Can't wait for this one.  A number of mysteries, some of which I have already ploughed through! I love mysteries, they are my somewhat guilty pleasure!  Finished Michael Connelly's Two Kinds of Truth (who doesn't love Harry Bosch?) and have John Grisham's The Rooster Bar waiting.  That's all!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJayapal/photos/a.1414585305218721.1073741829.1412651415412110/1806172116060036/?type=3",NA,313,25,44,58,0,6,0,0
