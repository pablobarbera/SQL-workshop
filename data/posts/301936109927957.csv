Investing in the working Americans who build our economy should have been the absolute priority of any true tax reform. Instead, the GOP tax bill systemically raises their taxes, attacks their health care, and erodes their economic dignity.

As citizens seek creative ways to engage with their government now more than ever, this stop in Newton on our third Tour 34 will allow us to build on past conversations, share the resources our office has to offer, and partner with advocates on the ground in our communities to fight for meaningful change.  Doors will open at 1:30PM. Hope to see you there!","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/505074316549653/",NA,897,39,4,74,0,3,0,1
