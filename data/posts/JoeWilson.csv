Our nation’s military personnel risk their lives to defend our nation and our freedoms—they should be able to trust that the benefits they designate for their spouses and families will provide for them.   That's why I've introduced the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, legislation that would support military families faced with the SBP-DIC off-set.

When taxes are low, businesses thrive, and jobs are created in the Reagan tradition.
