To many students throughout our country, Presidents’ Day is another day off of school. However, this federal holiday, established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington, celebrates not only the birth of our first president, but stands as a day to celebrate all U.S. presidents past and present.  In the past, I have been asked by students in the 3rd District about who my favorite presidents are. That answer is easy: George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Two men who selflessly navigated America through their terms and did what was right for our country and its people.  Before becoming our nation’s first president, George Washington demonstrated that he was a great leader during his time as the Commander of the Continental Army, against incredible odds that favored the British Army. General Washington never gave up, and eventually helped the United States win our independence from Great Britain. After his time as Commander of the Continental Army, in 1789 he became the first President of the United States of America under our Constitution. His leadership provided a firm foundation for our country, and he set many standards and precedents that future presidents have strived to maintain.  Then, in 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as our nation’s 16th president. President Lincoln led our country through its hardest years, the Civil War. However, in doing so, President Lincoln abolished slavery and modernized the economy. President Lincoln also gave one of our country’s most memorable presidential speeches– the Gettsyburg Address. In 272 words, and three minutes in length, President Lincoln asserted that all men are created equal and he defined the war as an effort dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all.  Today, Presidents’ Day isn’t just a federal holiday. Across the country, many patriotic and historical groups use February 22 as a day for celebrations and other events. Our deep American history is encouraging and so important for students to know what our country has been through. I encourage parents to tell their children what president they most admire and share their own stories about why. I hope all students continue to study and learn American history and also stay in touch with what is happening each and everyday – it is important to stay informed.","status",NA,NA,28,12,2,0,0,0,0,0

Premiums have gone up sharply, they are now doubled what they were half a decade ago. Worse than that, our deductibles have gone up sharply.” – Stephen, Osage Beach.  The above statement from an individual in the 3rd District is just one example of the countless stories I have heard about how Obamacare has drastically impacted Americans. These stories have not fallen on deaf ears. My colleagues and I have heard from individuals, families, doctors, and small businesses to craft a replacement that will empower you, not Washington. Over the last several years, House Republicans have continued to make a promise and that is that we will not only repeal Obamacare but we will also replace it with conservative solutions that put families, doctors, and states back in charge.  Obamacare is failing, so I agree with President Trump that the American Health Care Act is a critical first step in saving our country’s health-care system. This legislation will go through as a budget reconciliation bill, which means that a minority of Senators cannot obstruct and block its consideration and passage. Next, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price will take administrative action which will stabilize the health insurance market, increase choices, and lower costs. Lastly, Congress will advance additional legislative policies, such as allowing individuals to purchase coverage across state lines, that cannot be included in a reconciliation bill.  So, what is in this bill? I encourage everyone to go to readthebill.gop. On that website, you can find the full text of the legislation. We want everyone to have access to the American Health Care Act so you know what is in it and there are not any secrets.  First and foremost, the American Health Care Act preserves many important protections for patients and their families while making common-sense reforms to provide patients flexibility and reduced costs. This bill ensures coverage for pre-existing conditions, allows young adults to remain on their parents insurance to age 26, keeps the Medicare Part D donut hole closed, blocks federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood, and provides tax relief by getting rid of Obamacare’s worst taxes and ending the individual mandate.  The plan provides Americans access to a portable, monthly tax credit that can be used to buy a health insurance plan that is right for them – not one tied to a government mandated program. It nearly doubles the amount of money people can contribute to Health Savings Accounts and make these accounts more flexible so individuals can use it to purchase things they really need – like over-the-counter medications.  In addition, the American Health Care Act returns power to the states with the biggest entitlement reform in a generation. For the states across the country that expanded Medicaid, this bill phases out the expansion and puts the program on a budget, ending its open-ended funding and showing that entitlements can be reformed and made solvent for future generations. Missouri did not expand Medicaid, so Missourians who qualify for Medicaid will not be impacted.  In the weeks ahead, House Republicans and Congress will consider this plan through an open and transparent process. I have been to many meetings and briefings regarding the American Health Care Act and those will continue as the process moves along. I will continue to keep you informed of what is happening in Congress and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my offices so they can provide additional information.","status",NA,NA,52,80,10,0,1,0,1,15

While we all know the American flag is the symbol of our freedom and our national pride and the history behind Flag Day is important to know and understand.  On June 14, 1777, a resolution from the Second Continental Congress called for an official United States flag. The resolution called for the flag to “be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.” Then in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson wrote: “I therefore suggest and request that throughout the nation and if possible in every community the fourteenth day of June be observed as Flag Day with special patriotic exercises.” And in 1949, President Harry S. Truman signed Flag Day’s permanent observance into law.  The “Stars and Stripes” symbolize our freedom and strength, as well as the American spirit that others around the world have come to know and respect. Many of our fellow Americans have made tremendous sacrifices to preserve all that our American flag represents.  In the House of Representatives, there is a congressional flag program which individuals in the 3rd District can request a flag that has been flown over the United States Capitol. Each year, my office receives dozens of rquests from Eagle Scouts, veterans, individuals retiring or celebrating an anniversary and would like a flag to hang outside their home or keep inside. The price of the flag depends on the size and material. If you are interested in having a flag flown over the Capitol or if you have any questions, please call my Washington, D.C. office for more information. My staff would be happy to help.  I encourage you to take a moment and reflect on what the American flag means to you and to those who defended our country over the last hundreds of years.","status",NA,NA,16,3,1,0,0,0,1,0

The people and institutions that had no role in the financial crisis bear the brunt of this stifling, Washington-knows-best regulatory regime.   Earlier this year, the House of Representatives acted by passing the Financial CHOICE Act, which creates a more meaningful and effective financial regulatory structure that will restore consumers' faith in their financial system. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass this important legislation so it can get to the President's desk for his signature.","status",NA,NA,57,86,11,3,8,0,2,38

However, Missouri’s 3rd Congressional District is one of few areas across the country that will witness a total blackout of the sun, leaving only the sun’s atmosphere, called the corona, visable.  Many Missourians, including me, are very excited to witness this incredible experience. The total eclipse will stretch all the way from Oregon to South Carolina, covering 14 states inbetween. The longest period when the moon completely blocks the sun from any given location along the path will be approximately two minutes and 40 seconds. In Jefferson City, the moon will first start crossing in front of the sun at 11:46, and the total eclipse will begin at 1:13:07.  The last time the United States saw a total eclipse was in 1979, so an entire generation of Americans have not experienced this phenomenon. This is an excellent opportunity for our region to display our natural beauty, quality way of life, wonderful restaurants and, of course, great baseball teams to the thousands of tourists coming from around the country and globe.  From our state capital, to the Lake of the Ozarks, to the St. Louis area, we are proud of our home state and look forward to welcoming so many to Missouri.   Just as important as the economic value to our local economy, is the safe observation of the eclipse. I urge you to read how to safely view the sun during this event. While some of these tips may be obvious, they must be followed. Please visit eclipse2017.nasa.gov for safety instruction and historical facts.  Lastly, please be sure to share your stories with me via email or Facebook. I would love to hear how the 3rd District celebrates this once in a generation event.","status",NA,NA,86,15,10,4,1,2,1,0
