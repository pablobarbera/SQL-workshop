He spoke to a bipartisan group of freshmen Members of Congress. Also pictured is Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester.  We discussed the competitive advantage the US military has over our adversaries, and the reality that this advantage is eroding. General Dunford acknowledged these challenges, but reminded us that the quality of our military is A+.  He discussed many issues with us, the most pressing of which is our need for a coordinated effort to fight radical Islamic terror, and about the dawning of the age of cyber warfare.  We also discussed the various state actors around the world. We talked about the military and intelligence operations being built in Russia as they also try to undermine our credibility in NATO.  General Dunford also talked about China, North Korea, and the various challenges those countries are causing diplomatically.  The Chairman stressed the importance of a long-term bipartisan plan to give consistency, investment and strength to our armed forces and their leadership.

His leadership is especially relevant as producers face record world surpluses and depressed farm prices.  Throughout this long process, one silver lining has been the broad, bipartisan support shown for Perdue, and support coming from all over the ag community. It shows that agriculture can still put partisanship aside for the good of our country, economy and our producers. I welcome the chance to work hand-in-hand with the Secretary as we help producers navigate existing programs and as we look toward the 2018 farm bill.  In addition to farm and nutrition policy, I expect Perdue to be a sound champion for trade, something I have heard time and again from Kansans concerned about our ability to open new markets for products made in Kansas. Secretary Perdue's experience as an exporter and governor leading trade missions will be invaluable as this administration pursues trade policy.  As I have said before, Perdue’s background growing up on a farm, his service in the military as a veterinarian, as well as his career in agribusiness and successful tenure as governor, make him a good fit to lead the US Department of Agriculture at this critical time for our nation’s farmers and ranchers.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/KFRRNetwork/photos/a.545968498946656.1073741828.526560944220745/689006894642815/?type=3",NA,31,5,0,1,0,0,0,2

Having raced over to Hoisington shortly after its devastating destruction in 2001, and having witnessed firsthand a tornado go through our hunting cabin and hunting land and surrounding neighbors (the same tornado that destroyed Greensburg), this scene of leafless trees and flattened houses brought back to reality how helpless we all are in the face of Mother Nature.   According to Barton County Sheriff Bellendir, who has kept me updated, some 15 houses were left with only a foundation. One minor injury was treated on the scene.  Since the tornado, we've had several early evening storms, several of which contained 60 -70 mile an hour winds, hail, and sheets of ice like I've never seen before.  It would appear that some people will have excellent wheat crops this year, and others will have none.

Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act are one way the federal government can ensure our students get the hands-on educational experiences they need to excel.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RogerMarshallMD/photos/a.232963460482005.1073741828.232404617204556/309894222788928/?type=3",NA,55,5,19,1,0,0,0,0

My dad's parents had a dairy while my mom's parents were more typical diverse Kansas farmers. They had about 160 acres of wheat along with alfalfa, grain sorghum and about 60 acres of pasture for a herd of Hereford.  My memories of wheat harvest include my uncle driving the wheat truck to the co-op elevator in Burns and getting a different bottle of Crush pop with each visit. This was the first time I ever had anything but Coca-Cola or Pepsi and my favorites quickly became strawberry and grape.   As I grew up and became old enough to drive the wheat truck or the tractors, I remember my grandma bringing shakes to the field on hot summer afternoons - made with vanilla ice cream and strawberry crush pop.  I also remember losing a wheat crop three days before harvest from a hailstorm and watching another wheat crop fail due to too much rain and not being able to get in the fields.  Those years remind me why my grandpa was so diligent about watching the weather report every night at 10:20 p.m.  My life seems a bit surreal this weekend: my close friend being nearly mortally shot just three days ago, playing in a baseball game that has become a congressional tradition, and riding on a combine yesterday outside Hoisington in a wheat field that I've used for pheasant hunts over the years.  Thanks to the Stoskopf family, Dean and Mary Anne, Julia and Josh, for letting me tag along today and relive some of those memories.  Wheat prices are at record lows but the yields look promising. It will be another very very tough year for agriculture. The experience only reinforces the importance of opening up new markets and trade opportunities and writing a strong farm bill.   I wish all of the farm families a safe and prosperous wheat harvest. Thank you for all you do for our great nation","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RogerMarshallMD/photos/a.232963460482005.1073741828.232404617204556/310360942742256/?type=3",NA,245,11,7,9,1,0,0,0

With it, the city is replacing a 104-year-old water tower and 50,000 gallon tank, while also putting new lines under the city. An engineer said the existing infrastructure could fail at any time.  I also stopped at the Minneola District Hospital, where CEO Debbie Bruner showed how they are benefitting from a USDA Rural Development loan. She said they were attracted to the low interest rates. Minneola is a town of 700 people, and they are now able to have development on their important medical facility to comply with ADA requirements, and update their technology.  These examples show the importance of farm bill programs like these in rural development for our small towns.

These are friends of my children, brothers and sisters of babies I’ve delivered, and members of my community. They didn’t put themselves in this position, and my heart goes out to them.  The United States is in this position due to the unilateral approach the previous administration took toward enacting DACA. It is because of that one-sided approach that we now have uncertainty and inconsistency throughout the entire immigration system. Consistency should be the hallmark of American governance.  Our resources, especially as they pertain to deportation, must remain focused on getting rid of bad people who present a danger to the American citizen – not a young person who is here simply due to circumstance. To date, 787,000 young people have legally registered with the U.S. government, and showed their willingness to follow our laws. We cannot allow that information to now be used against them in reverse order.  We are having these conversations now in Congress. Just a month ago, a Democrat colleague of mine and I got a bipartisan group of freshmen Members of Congress in a room to discuss what we can do to move forward on bipartisan, thoughtful solutions to the crises many communities and families are now facing.  Congress must use legal, legislative avenues to figure out how to help these young people, so long as they follow our laws. My priorities on this issue have always been, and will remain, to secure the border and help develop a workable visa for our farmers and producers back home. We must do right by them, by these young people and the safety of the American public.","status",NA,NA,342,242,59,38,3,1,4,28

Since 1986, the American people have not seen a meaningful update in federal tax policy. They have been asking for it for decades, and today, we've taken a huge step forward in delivering that promise.  More than anything else, the most common complaint I hear about the existing tax system is it's complexity. With this in mind, we aim to make it possible to file your taxes on a postcard. This simpler, quicker and easier system will give working and middle class Kansans the same access to the tax code as someone who has hired teams of accountants and lawyers to seek out every loophole.  These aren't just abstract changes for those who don't need it. Ideas like repealing the death tax, and allowing the first $12,000 of income for individuals and $24,000 for couples to be tax-free, and married couples to keep the first $24,000, are tangible ways that this reform will allow more money to stay in your pocket.  This fairer, simpler system will be a huge relief for the working and middle class. Gone are the days of a 75,000-page tax code full of favors and loopholes for the most powerful, wealthy and well-connected. This reform is overdue, and why many of my colleagues and I came to this body - to bring real-world, commonsense reform for our generation, for our kids, and for our grandkids.

The American family of four making the national median income of $59,000 will receive a $1,182 tax cut. More than 80% of families in the Big First use the standard deduction. Doubling the standard deduction while allowing those same families to file their taxes on a postcard will make it so Kansans can spend that time and money as they see fit.  When the framework for tax reform was announced two months ago, the House promised to lower rates, simplify the code and let hardworking taxpayers keep more of their money. It is clear upon first review that the Committee on Ways and Means has kept its word. Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady deserves congratulations for getting us to this point, and I look forward to the Committee's discussion, markup and having the bill on the floor of the House this year.

Throughout my career as a Doctor, I have spent decades working alongside female doctors, nurses and patients who were far too often put in inappropriate and sometimes downright dangerous situations because of their gender in the workplace or even at home. I am deeply concerned to hear that not only were these incidents uncovered on Capitol Hill, but that taxpayer funds were used to silence victims and defend the perpetrators. This is downright wrong – and the system must be fixed. Moving forward, it will remain a matter of upmost importance to my office to dedicate as much time and resources necessary to ensure that this type of behavior does not take place. From top-to-bottom, all members of my staff have taken a mandatory and comprehensive sexual harassment training course designed to ensure proper workplace conduct and performance; and what exactly to do if a problem arises.   Speaker Ryan and House Leadership has strongly urged all of my colleagues in Congress take similar steps to protect their staff and preserve a positive, safe and productive work environment.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RogerMarshallMD/videos/373753369736346/",NA,141,64,5,6,0,1,2,2

With no support from the federal or state government, the staff at the Dream Center run one of the most efficient homeless shelters and drug rehabilitation programs I’ve seen. The faith-based recovery program requires participants to be involved in some type of work program either at the Dream Center or in the community. In return employers in Great Bend open their businesses to these individuals who need a second chance and support on their path to success.   As a physician, I truly believe that long-term success in a rehabilitation program requires a spiritual component, a faith in God and hope for all. The local ownership and community-wide investment in the Dream Center has allowed hundreds of people to regain employment, housing and a drug-free life.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RogerMarshallMD/photos/a.232963460482005.1073741828.232404617204556/385328238578859/?type=3",NA,379,28,28,31,0,5,0,2

Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I am excited to continue fighting for Kansas.   From Cuba to Israel to China. From rolling back regulations to tax cuts. This year sure has been eventful.  I've held 55 town halls and more than 70 round tables. Speaking directly with my constituents is a top priority for me, thats why I also held numerous community visits across the state discussing the Farm Bill with my constituents.   2017 is a year I will never forget. But more than anything else, I’ll treasure the new friends I’ve made and the many old friends who have continued our journey together.  I’m most grateful for the sacrifices my wife and family have made.  While fighting for Kansas in D.C. it has been hard on my family. I have been blessed beyond my greatest dreams, given the opportunity to serve some 800,000 Kansans and this great country. This country, this living breathing country we call America, she is a big ship, a BIG BIG ship.And Im confident we’ve turned her back in the right direction.  We will continue to tack into the wind, and continue this journey!  I wish you all a happy and healthy 2018, and pray, that God will bless us in this new year!","video","https://www.facebook.com/RogerMarshallMD/videos/386438731801143/",NA,115,51,3,4,0,0,1,20
