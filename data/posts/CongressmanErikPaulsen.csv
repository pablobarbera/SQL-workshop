Keith Avila, an Uber driver in Sacramento, overheard two women in his car coaching a teenage girl on how to get money from a ""john"" on their way to a hotel. Once he dropped them off, he called the police, who arrested the two women at the hotel as well as a man who was found with the victim. The victim was a teenage runaway.   Putting an end to human trafficking will require being vigilant, keeping an eye out for suspicious situations, and taking proactive efforts to inform law enforcement like Keith did. We can all play a part in this effort. I hope the victim receives the help she needs and commend Keith for his heroism.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/12/30/an-eavesdropping-uber-driver-saved-his-16-year-old-passenger-from-her-pimps-police-say/?utm_term=.f51732f6813e","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/12/30/an-eavesdropping-uber-driver-saved-his-16-year-old-passenger-from-her-pimps-police-say/?utm_term=.f51732f6813e","washingtonpost.com",114,15,13,7,0,0,0,0

We have made huge strides, but there is still more work to be done.  On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, I was honored to speak at an event with survivor leaders and advocates to protect victims. In honor of this day, I am also proud to be an original cosponsor on Congresswoman Ann Wagner's Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, which supports victims by allowing them to petition courts to have their criminal records cleared for crimes committed as a direct result of human trafficking. Together, we can end human trafficking.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanErikPaulsen/photos/a.174025079301481.31780.128558293848160/1201665689870743/?type=3",NA,39,37,2,0,0,0,0,0

This initiative hits on three key reforms that I am glad to see. First, it repeals the harmful medical device tax, so that life-saving and -changing medical technologies will be more affordable and accessible for patients. Second, it enhances and expands Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) so that families and individuals can spend their health care dollars the way they want. Third, it provides a monthly tax credit to individuals and families who don't receive insurance from their jobs.  This effort also includes two provisions I am supportive of, such as preserving coverage for those with preexisting conditions and allowing 26-year-olds to stay on their parents‚Äô insurance.  Unlike the last time Congress took on health care reform, this is going to be an open and transparent process, so please visit ReadTheBill.gop to check out and read the bill for yourself.","link","https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/","housegop.leadpages.co",32,304,15,2,1,2,10,200
