Americans deserve the truth.  From the outset of this confirmation process, Scott Pruitt has consistently misrepresented his environmental record and denied us the information we require to perform our duty to advise and consent. It's incumbent upon the nominee to provide answers to the specific, substantive questions that have been asked over the course of the last five weeks.   The EPA performs a critical duty that protects Americans and saves lives. If Mr. Pruitt is serious about leading this important agency, he should be more than willing to provide clear answers to our important questions.  In 2013, Republican members of this committee expressed in a letter to then-Chairman Boxer that ""EPW precedent illustrates that without answers to questions and information requests, it is not appropriate to move forward with the nominee."" I could not agree more with my colleagues. Our requests are reasonable: we ask Mr. Pruitt to provide straightforward answers information so that we can move on.","link","http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/317311-dems-boycott-committee-vote-on-trumps-epa-pick","thehill.com",275,80,16,17,0,1,2,9

Between President Trump’s unconscionable executive order, his alarming rhetoric on torture, his feud with Mexico’s president, and his cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin, I ask myself whether Mr. Tillerson is able to stand up to President Trump and his reckless assaults on our values and his casual dismissal of longstanding U.S. allies. Now, perhaps more than ever, we need a leader at the State Department who will reassure our allies of America’s commitment to democracy and humanitarianism, and instill a sense of confidence in the department’s employees. I am not confident that Mr. Tillerson is that person, and that's why I voted against his nomination to be our next Secretary of State.  I don’t say that lightly. Mr. Tillerson is a man of faith who has led a successful business. Unfortunately, during his hearing, he did not demonstrate that he had the breadth of knowledge necessary to be America’s top diplomat. Given President Trump’s woeful lack of experience on this front, not to mention a questionable temperament, our next Secretary of State simply cannot learn on the job. I hope I am wrong and that Mr. Tillerson becomes a strong voice in the Trump Administration to maintain and uphold our values across the globe.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-confirmed.html?rref=politics&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&pgtype=Multimedia","nytimes.com",138,60,21,6,1,0,21,23

Today that seat – what should be Judge Garland’s seat – remains vacant. The unprecedented obstruction my Republican colleagues in the Senate mounted last year against Judge Garland was a shameful chapter for the United States Senate and our Constitution. Judge Garland, a consensus builder and one of the most qualified and respected judges in the country, waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that ultimately never came. A good man was treated terribly.  Meanwhile, Judge Neil Gorsuch has met with Democrats and Republicans in large numbers. A lengthy hearing covering several days was held 48 days after his nomination. Now, Republicans are prepared to speedily bring his nomination to the floor, something they were not prepared to do when they had almost an entire year to consider Judge Garland’s nomination. Ultimately, I believe that moving forward with Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will send a signal that it’s acceptable to put partisan politics over fidelity to our Constitution. It is not. While I do not believe that two wrongs make a right, I believe this may be our only opportunity to right a historic wrong. Therefore, I am left with no other choice but to oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination until we find agreement on moving Judge Garland’s nomination forward at the same time.","status",NA,NA,695,231,94,80,1,0,9,39

But, military action alone will not bring an end to this bloody civil war, and I strongly support working with our allies to pursue a diplomatic solution.   Unfortunately this recent chemical attack is only the latest reminder that the people of Syria are suffering tremendously. We have an obligation to help them in any way that we can.

In the morning, I joined Mayor Mike Purzycki and DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin for a briefing by state officials on the measurable impacts that climate change is having on Wilmington’s communities. After our briefing, we toured the Wilmington Wetlands Project, which will create wetlands to handle excess storm water runoff and reduce chronic flooding in the Southbridge neighborhood. I headed to Odessa to meet up with DelDOT officials and take a look at sections of Route 9 being considered for permanent closure due to frequent flooding. Twice a day now, the incoming tide “overtops” – or covers up – entire sections of the road.   Next I visited St. Jones Reserve, just outside of Dover Air Force Base, to learn about Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve (DNERR)’s research on long-term weather changes and water quality. The scientists there are measuring impacts of climate change on plant and animal life in Delaware’s wetlands and marshes. Tidal marshes like St. Jones Reserve act as natural buffers between Delaware’s coastal communities and incoming tidewaters and storm surges. I finished out the day in Dewey Beach, touring the living shoreline being built around Dewey to protect our communities from shoreline erosion caused by rising sea levels and more frequent, increasingly severe storms.   Delaware is the lowest lying state in the country, and it will take all of us, working together, to protect the First State from the unprecedented challenge of protecting our communities in the decades to come.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/tomcarper/photos/a.690280080982830.1073741854.124891107521733/1524706434206853/?type=3",NA,96,9,13,7,0,0,0,0

President Trump’s decision today raises more questions than it answers. What changed since the president took office for him to lose confidence in Director Comey’s ability to do the job? Why did Attorney General Sessions, who has recused himself from the investigation into Russia's interference into the presidential election, recommend Director Comey be fired or have any role in that decision?   Now more than ever, it should be clear we must appoint a special counsel to finish the job in order to ensure that any findings about Russia’s influence in the last election are not clouded by partisan controversy. As we move forward with a new FBI Director, Democrats and Republicans must come together to ensure that he or she is beyond reproach, eminently qualified and totally independent in thought and deed.","status",NA,NA,900,196,102,25,4,6,6,54

This means that more than 12,000 Delawareans will have to find a new insurance plan and our hardworking families will have fewer options and harder choices to make about their health insurance coverage.  Instead of following through on President Trump's promise to ensure that all Americans would have better and less expensive health insurance, the Trump Administration has done just the opposite by sabotaging the ACA insurance marketplaces in any possible way. Adding to nearly a decade of failed repeal efforts by House and Senate Republicans, the president has ordered the repeal of the ACA by regulation and repeatedly threatened cost-sharing reductions for patients. This continued assault on the ACA’s insurance marketplaces, just when they were becoming financially stable, has sowed confusion and fear among Americans about whether they will be able to access health care.  For years, we struggled to reform our health care system so that every family has access to affordable, high-quality health care. By passing the ACA, we took a tremendous step toward making good on that promise. However, I’ve long said the ACA isn’t perfect, and that we should work together on a bipartisan basis to make it better. Unfortunately, the health care bill passed by the House Republicans last week would weaken consumer protections and make health insurance premiums and deductibles more expensive.  But I’m an optimist, and I’m not going to give up. I ask our president and my colleagues in Congress to see that they are not doing right by the people who sent them to Washington. I ask them to change course. Something this big and this important should not be done on a partisan basis. If they’ll meet us halfway, they’ll find earnest partners in me and my fellow Democrats.","link","http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/12/obamacare-aetna-delaware-trump-repeal/315943001/","delawareonline.com",122,107,70,3,1,7,57,70

Meanwhile, over 190 nations will remain united in moving forward without us to combat what is, perhaps, the greatest challenge we face today: climate change.

Not this.’ I thank God the victims of this attack, including Representative Steve Scalise, are expected to recover. In a turbulent time, and in a turbulent Capitol, we look for something that draws us together. Baseball does.  For 10 years, I served in the House and played on the Democratic Congressional baseball team. We had a good-spirited rivalry with our Republican opponents. We had great fun. It was one of the things that brought us together every year. I love baseball and I know a lot of other people do as well. I look back fondly on those years.  Thank God for the Capitol police officers who jumped into action. I thank our Capitol police every day, and it takes a special meaning today. There’s a verse in the New Testament that says, ‘Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.’ In this case, these officers were willing to risk their own lives to protect not just the congressmen, but the staff and people who were there. Thank God for them.","status",NA,NA,459,58,34,56,0,0,59,1

During his Senate confirmation process, Mr. Wray committed to upholding our Constitution and maintaining the independence and integrity of the FBI. Under oath, Mr. Wray pledged to allow Special Counsel Mueller’s ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials to continue unimpeded, and to assist in that investigation as needed.

For those who don't stay healthy forever, this bill is downright dangerous.‬ It cuts Medicaid by hundreds of billions and guts vital consumer protections, including those for individuals with preexisting protections. For just about everybody—but especially women, older Americans, anyone with a preexisting condition or anyone who receives an unexpected diagnosis—this proposal will make health care unaffordable. It goes against nearly ALL of the advice we heard from witnesses in the bipartisan HELP hearings, including Republican governors, about how we can work together to immediately stabilize the exchanges and lower costs.  Since Thursday last week, our committee alone has received more than 26,000 emails from people who are concerned about this proposal. Today, the hallway outside the hearing room is lined with hundreds of people who rely on quality health care and have so much at stake in this debate. I prepared for the hearing by reading some of those emails and talking to the people who traveled from across the country to make their voices heard. Thank you for speaking out. Keep speaking out.

Over the past several years, as chairman and then ranking member of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee – Democrats, I made several trips to our southern and northern borders and heard from people on the ground that ""force multiplier"" technologies are key to helping border agents perform their mission. These technologies and tools cost a lot less than building a border wall — and, unlike a border wall, we know they are effective.  But continued efforts to secure our southern border will be wasted if we don’t also work with our neighbors in Central America to address root causes of migration to the United States. In Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, widespread violence, lack of economic opportunity and lack of rule of law lead many Central Americans to undertake the dangerous journey to our southern border.

Now he's being considered to lead EPA's chemical safety office.  This is not just another nominee of President Trump. And this nominee is not just up for any job at EPA. The work done in the agency's chemical safety office has a farther reach than most Americans will ever realize. Its work determines whether the products we use to clean our kitchen counters are safe. It determines whether the toys our children and grandchildren play with, or the bottles they use or the water they drink, are free of chemicals that may hurt them or harm their development.
