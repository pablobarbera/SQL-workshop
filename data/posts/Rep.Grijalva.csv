Immigrants will be less likely to provide vital information out of fear for their own safety.   Furthermore, refugees, by definition, are people fleeing from persecution—not persecutors themselves.

Trump’s first week in office has been marked by one reckless and short-sighted statement after another, and this is no exception. Not only has Trump confirmed that Mexico will not pay for the wall – every dime of this tariff will be shouldered by American consumers – but he has also just given our third largest trading partner in the world good reason to retaliate against U.S. exports. In my home state of Arizona, cross-border commerce brings $737 million into our economy every month. And overall, $2.3 billion in U.S. goods from around the country flow through our state and into Mexico every month. All of this is sure to be undermined by Trump’s selfish pursuit of a partisan campaign promise that was completely detached from reality from the beginning.   News of Trump’s opening salvo against Mexico – a nation that has been nothing but a loyal ally and neighbor to the American people – comes just one day before he is expected to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The DACA program protected rising young people from the threat of deportation that they never deserved. These kids had no say in how they arrived here; they have pledged allegiance to no flag but ours; and they’ve wanted nothing more than to continue to call the only nation they’ve ever known as home, home. My heart breaks at the thought that they will once again face the possibility deportation at any moment. The cruel, punitive and dangerous actions by a feckless Donald Trump jeopardize our economy and our community.  Trump is waging a war with human decency, and while Mexico and DACA recipients are the direct victims today, it is the American people who will be harmed most in the end. Trade alliances that drive our economy are being threatened and blatantly undermined. Young aspiring Americans whose talents could propel the United States in the global economy are being targeted for removal. And hardworking Americans will pay more for foreign goods, will likely sell fewer products abroad with a major trading partner, and will see our nation’s moral authority continue to whither under a leader who is clearly indifferent to anything that doesn’t benefit him directly.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexican-president-cancels-visit-to-washington-as-tensions-with-trump-administration-intensify/2017/01/26/ececc3da-e3d9-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_mexicous-1210p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.b696749ef1f3","washingtonpost.com",396,106,575,6,3,14,77,224

And we see it in the press – the often maligned journalists whose work of holding a dishonest administration accountable has never been as important as it is right now.   Collectively, we all refuse to cower under Trump’s shadow. The stain he has placed on the White House cannot outlast the good in humanity that is shining past him each and every day.

Grijalva","2017-02-07","2017-02-07 18:32:45","Betsy DeVos’s confirmation marks a new low in the Republican Party’s drive to dismantle public education. Ms. DeVos made it clear during her Senate testimony that she does not understand crucial debates within the field of education; she cannot differentiate between federal, state and local education policies; she lacks the understanding needed to comply with federal civil rights laws; and she cannot grasp the financial struggles working families have with affordable childcare and the astronomical cost of higher education.    Very few cabinet nominees in history have proven themselves to be this incompetent in the field they seek to lead. And of those examples, DeVos stands alone in being confirmed despite her flaws.   So here’s a question every American should ask: at what point would Ms. DeVos have disqualified herself for the GOP? What red line could she have crossed when she’s already proven herself ignorant of the subject matter, and lacks any experience running a government agency? Add to that the years DeVos spent undermining public education in favor of privatized schools for the rich to profit from, and the answer becomes crystal clear: never. Whether Republicans cast this party-line vote to drive a final nail into the coffin of public education, or whether they did it because DeVos is a billionaire heiress who has been contributing to their campaigns for years, the fact remains that they were never going to be deterred.  The victims of Ms. DeVos’s tenure will be children who have no ability to fight back. But the impact will scar our society as a whole, stunting our ability to accomplish great feats and solidifying the United States as a two tier society: those born into a family that can afford a high-quality education, and everyone else. This is not a vision for American greatness. This is a moment our society will come to regret.  As a senior member of the Education and Workforce Committee, I will work every day to hold Ms. DeVos accountable to our children. I will join Democrats in opposing any effort to undermine the integrity of our public schools, and I will demand answers for any policy that does not lead our country towards ensuring all students, regardless of their backgrounds, can earn the high-quality education they deserve.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/senate-to-vote-today-on-confirmation-of-betsy-devos/2017/02/06/fd4b7e9c-ec85-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_devos-615a%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.75005c854a9e","washingtonpost.com",319,109,349,6,4,6,160,386

Rescinding that progress does more than set the LGBT community and our country back – it sends a clear message that the individual rights and safety of the American people are not a priority for this administration.

Seniors will no longer be protected from price gouging the way they are under the ACA; insurers would be able to charge the oldest Americans five times as much as the youngest Americans, and estimates on premium spikes for a 64-year-old are as high as $10,600. The Medicaid expansion that has helped cover millions of low-income individuals and families will be financially capped in 2020, and left to wither on the vine as the costs of living – and the costs of life-saving medicine – continue to rise. Perhaps worst of all, this plan allows insurers to impose a 30 percent premium surcharge to anyone who does not maintain continuous coverage. Because this fee is only triggered when an individual wants to reenter the insurance market, it creates a strong disincentive for anyone in good health who does not have insurance to ever get coverage. Fewer people in the system will simply mean higher premiums for everyone.   This isn’t a plan to improve public health; it’s a scheme to give millionaires and billionaires tax breaks at the expense of the poor and the sick.

It is a milestone protection under the Affordable Care Act and a symbol that healthcare is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.   Now, Republicans continue to push poisonous policies and amendments that do nothing to protect the people they serve. Amendments floating around targeting the pre-existing condition mandate are dangerous and misleading.   Under the amendment, individuals with pre-existing conditions will once again be forced to pay higher premiums making their healthcare essentially unaffordable.

Far too many people – 90 per day to be precise – lose their lives to the barrel of a gun. This must stop. Perhaps what is both a reason to be optimistic and the most tragic aspect of this issue is that the majority of these deaths are preventable. While we must tackle the mental health and social issues that perpetuate gun violence, there is common-sense legislation that the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with, such as ending the gun show loopholes and strengthening background checks, that would help ensure guns stay out of the wrong hands. The Republicans can spin these proposals however they’d like, claiming that they are part of a conspiracy to take away your guns, but the fact remains that the GOP won’t even allow the Center for Disease Control to study this issue, much less bring a vote to the House Floor. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Rep.Grijalva/photos/a.74201016233.77479.73539896233/10154823243661234/?type=3",NA,54,18,7,11,0,0,0,0

That’s why I have introduced the Veterans Visa & Protection Act in order to remedy this glaring mishap in how we treat our veterans. This bill would establish a visa program that allows deported veterans who meet certain requirements to enter the U.S. as lawful permanent residents and provides those who are admitted with a path to citizenship and the ability to receive their military and veteran benefits.

Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize and celebrate Barbara  Grijalva on her retirement from KOLD News 13, Tucson.  Barbara has been a fixture of our community from her first time on  screen in 1983. Born and raised in Tucson, Barbara is a unique, homegrown personality. For 34 years, Barbara worked tirelessly to provide Tucson and Southern Arizona with the most relevant and updated news, both local and  national, and is considered a living legend by her coworkers and viewers. During her time on KOLD News 13, Barbara was flexible in her reporting, working as both an anchor and a reporter in the field; in times of need, Barbara could always be counted on by her team to get the job done. Above all, Barbara Grijalva is a trusted professional whose reporting is always defined by the facts. In these times, the loss of a journalist of Barbara's caliber is significant.  Her talent, demeanor, and style will be missed coming into our homes  and our minds. We thank Barbara for the contributions and impact she  has given us, and we wish her well in her next adventure.  https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/06/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E829-2","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Rep.Grijalva/photos/a.74201016233.77479.73539896233/10154882887691234/?type=3",NA,248,15,13,22,0,0,0,0

As we celebrate Independence Day, let's pause and thank our common history and embrace who we are as a nation. We can join our new citizens and pledge to defend our country and protect our democracy from all enemies foreign or domestic. We can do so because it is our country too. #HappyIndependenceDay!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/Rep.Grijalva/photos/a.10152310695491234.1073741843.73539896233/10154938207001234/?type=3",NA,303,20,30,65,0,3,0,0

You might remember Deja from her viral exchange with Sen. Flake at a Mesa Town Hall a few months ago where she shared her story. It is precisely women like Deja that will be impacted most. Among other things, the Senate bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to Planned Parenthood for one year, disproportionately hurting low-income women, and accounting for a loss of 75% of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding.

Whether it be his refusal to cut off compromising foreign business ties, his unprecedented attacks on the press, or his infantile behavior towards political opponents, Donald Trump has proven unable to follow the most basic presidential rules and norms.","link","http://thehill.com/homenews/house/342725-dems-launch-no-confidence-resolution-against-trump","thehill.com",706,124,142,111,7,16,4,13

As a dreamer, I was very worried about not being able to go to college because I know that there were opportunities out there but if you don't go to college, its really hard to take advantage. But when DACA came around, it was a huge relief for my family and myself. When I hear things on the news, even just people saying things about immigrants and generalizing them or stereotyping us, it definitely makes me sad and upset because I know the work of my Dad - the fact that he goes to work every single night just so that we can have food to eat and pay our bills is not him being lazy or trying to take advantage of anyone in the United States. My brother and I and even our parents try our best to give back to our communities by volunteering or by helping at our church. We are not here just to take.  In five to ten years, I see myself serving my community in any way that is possible. I'm no longer motivated by financial stability. I think that the best way to live is to bring love and kindness to others. So, I am studying to be a teacher. I'm really excited to be working in a classroom with students, who have been told like myself, that they can't do certain things or that they're not going to be able to go to college. I'm excited to show them that it is possible, that they can do it and that they have so much more value than they've been told.

This case carries significant consequences for civil rights in our country, as it could open the door for other business owners to deny service based on their customer’s sexual orientation and potentially other background characteristics, including religion or race.   Let’s be clear: this case was never about freedom of religion or expression. It is about allowing discriminatory individuals to use their religion as an excuse to deny business to LGBTQ customers. This an egregious violation of our most basic human dignity, and runs contrary to our shared values of equality and inclusion. As a person of faith, I take personal offense to those who use their religion to discriminate against and degrade others simply for being who they are.
