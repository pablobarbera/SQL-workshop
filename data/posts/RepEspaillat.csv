It guarantees access to affordable, high-quality healthcare as a right for all Americans. Backing out of this commitment is irresponsible, inexcusable, and reprehensible. As a Member of a Congressional District that houses some of the largest hospitals in the country, health is a crucial issue for my constituents. Under the ACA, millions of Americans now have access to affordable healthcare through marketplaces and Medicaid expansion. Children in New York can remain on their parents’ plans through age 29. And insurance companies cannot discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions. Repeal will be detrimental to our health care systems and medical research communities. Without a plan to replace the ACA, Republicans are openly gambling with the health care of millions. Many who will be affected, like the elderly and disabled, cannot afford to return to the old system of skyrocketing costs. I will fight for those Americans who rely on the ACA and I urge my colleagues to do the same."" - Rep.

New York’s Thirteenth Congressional District has a rich legacy of African American history.  From the legendary Apollo Theater that first opened its doors in 1914 and introduced the world to Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, and Lauryn Hill; to the Audubon Ballroom where Malcolm X was assassinated and now stands in memoriam the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center; to Harlem’s famous Sylvia’s Restaurant which opened its doors in 1962 by founder Sylvia Woods also known as the Queen of Soulfood – these institutions are cultural landmarks that help tell the story of the African American experience that runs throughout communities across the land.        Black History Month encourages each of us to recognize the threads of African American history that continue in our society today in areas such as arts and entertainment, education and technology, in service to our country and our communities.  First recognized in 1926 by historian Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Black History Month allows us to reflect on the collective strength that diversity continues to bring to the United States today.    As we celebrate African American history and culture, we would be negligent to not address the continued challenges that African Americans continue to face in communities across the country – from higher unemployment rates, a disparity in wealth and opportunities for wealth building, disparities in health and education, to higher rates of mass incarceration and an overrepresentation in our country’s criminal justice system.  It is critical that we work together to find real solutions to address the problems that continue to plague African American communities and devastate Black families if we are to ensure a better, brighter and more equitable future for the entire country. - http://bit.ly/2kVeaBo","link","http://bit.ly/2kVeaBo","bit.ly",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We can never forget the horrors that were inflicted through slavery, and the African Burial Ground Memorial will play an important role in our ability to better understand the past and honor the history that all groups of people have had to American culture and our continued crusade for freedom and justice for all.”     The African Burial Ground International Memorial Museum and Education Center Act legislation would authorize funding and establish a museum at the African Burial Ground in Lower Manhattan.  The proposed site is located within the African Burial Ground National Historic Landmark, an area in Lower Manhattan near City Hall that holds the remains of an estimated 20,000 enslaved Africans and early-generation African-Americans from the colonial era.  The legislation, led by Senators Schumer and Gillibrand in the Senate and Congressman Nadler in the House would establish a museum and educational center managed by the National Park Service in consultation with the African Burial Ground Advisory Council.  The African Burial Ground officially became a National Historic Landmark in 1993; and in 2006, was officially designated a National Monument.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1826773937534605/?type=3",NA,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Establecer el Museo Memorial Internacional y Centro Educativo del Cementerio Africano en Nueva York, donde están enterrados los restos de cerca de 20,000 esclavos africanos y afroamericanos de la primera generación de la era colonial, es una formidable manera de reflexionar sobre el significado del sufrimiento y la injusticia que produjo la esclavitud en los Estados Unidos. Nunca podremos olvidar los horrores que se infligieron por medio de la esclavitud, y el Museo Memorial del Cementerio Africano desempeñará un papel importante en nuestra capacidad para comprender mejor el pasado y honrar la historia de todos los grupos de personas que han tenido un impacto en la cultura estadounidense y en nuestra continua cruzada por libertad y justicia para todos"".   La legislación del Museo Memorial Internacional y Centro Educativo del Cementerio Africano autorizará la financiación y creará un Museo del Cementerio Africano en el Bajo Manhattan. El sitio propuesto está ubicado en el Monumento Nacional del Cementerio Africano, inscrito en el Registro Nacional de Lugares Históricos, un área en el Bajo Manhattan cerca de la Alcaldía, que contiene los restos de unos 20,000 esclavos africanos y afroamericanos de la primera generación de la era colonial. La legislación, encabezada por los senadores federales Schumer y Gillibrand en el Senado y el congresista Nadler en la Cámara de Representantes, establecería un museo y un centro educativo administrado por el Servicio Nacional de Parques en consulta con el Consejo Asesor del Cementerio Africano.

As the first Dominican-American in Congress, it is my goal to highlight the achievements of those who have contributed to American society and culture.  Though Oscar was highly regarded by some of the most prominent figures of our time, including First Ladies, he maintained his humility and never cast aside those who were less fortunate. His creativity, resourcefulness, and love for life are admirable characteristics that made him a true national treasure.  Oscar was widely known for his love of country and deep affection for the Dominican and Dominican-American community.  I am proud to see Oscar’s legacy honored and hope to keep his memory alive.

Guns assembled using these kits are called ghost guns because they are often times completely untraceable, assembled using a receiver that does not have a serial number, and are almost impossible to be tracked by law enforcement.  The Ghost Guns Are Guns Act closes this loophole as these guns are more often used in violent crimes and pose serious safety concerns to our communities and law enforcement. - Said Rep. Espaillat  ""Es un hecho poco conocido que personas que de otro modo estarían impedidas de comprar armas de fuego todavía tienen la capacidad de comprar un kit de ensamblaje de armas en internet"". ""Las armas ensambladas usando estos kits son llamadas armas indetectables o fantasmas porque a menudo son completamente imposibles de rastrear, son ensambladas usando un receptor que no tiene un número de serie, y son casi imposibles de ser rastreadas por la policía. La ley Armas Indetectables son Armas (Ghost Guns Are Guns Act) cierra esta brecha, ya que estas armas se utilizan con más frecuencia en los crímenes violentos y plantean graves preocupaciones de seguridad a nuestras comunidades y a las agencias de aplicación de la ley"". dijo el congresista Espaillat  H.R.1278 amends Title 18 of the United States Code to include firearm assembly kits in the definition of firearms.  http://bit.ly/2mOtRfl","link","http://bit.ly/2mOtRfl","bit.ly",7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This bill will mean over $4.5 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the first 4 years, and workers across the spectrum will lose access to critical health insurance through the elimination of the essential health benefits.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1841641456047853/?type=3",NA,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Serrano (NY-15) y Don Beyer (VA-08) introdujeron una nueva legislación dirigida a proteger los lugares sensibles durante los esfuerzos de aplicación de la ley de inmigración.   La Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles prohíbe la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, incluyendo arrestos, entrevistas, búsquedas y vigilancia en ""lugares sensibles"", que incluyen áreas como instalaciones de servicios médicos o de cuidado de salud, escuelas públicas y privadas, lugares de culto, tribunales, oficinas del Departamento de Vehículos de Motor, DMV, sitios donde proveen servicios de emergencia, etc.   ""Nuestra intención con la Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles es prohibir que las fuerzas del orden público realicen arrestos y detenciones en lugares altamente sensibles, como sitios de culto, escuelas, hospitales y lugares públicos"", dijo el congresista Espaillat. ""Las personas no deben ser arrestadas mientras velan a sus seres queridos en los funerales o mientras dejan a su hijo en la escuela. La Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles hace rendir cuentas a los agentes de aplicación de la ley y se asegura de que ellos actúen con apego a la ley"".   ""Nuestras comunidades inmigrantes merecen estar a salvo y sentirse seguras cuando acceden a la justicia, buscan educación y atención médica, o practican su fe"", dijo la congresista Bonamici. ""Acciones recientes de ICE han sido agresivas y despreciables, y no mejoran la seguridad de nuestras comunidades. La Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles mantendrá a ICE fuera de lugares sensibles y garantizará que las familias de inmigrantes puedan llevar a sus hijos a la escuela, ir a los sitios de culto o buscar órdenes de protección y asistencia policial. Esta legislación se necesita urgentemente"".   ""En las semanas recientes, mi oficina ha recibido informes profundamente preocupantes de la presencia de agentes de ICE en lugares sensibles e importantes de mi distrito. Las actividades de ICE en estos lugares vitales y esenciales desincentivan a los inmigrantes, incluso a los que tienen documentados, de hacer cosas como acceder a beneficios básicos, denunciar crímenes y asegurar su salud y bienestar. La Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles definirá claramente y ampliará la lista de sitios que actualmente califican como lugares sensibles, garantizando así que están fuera del alcance de ICE, salvo en circunstancias muy limitadas, en mi distrito y en todo el país. También requerirá un informe sobre cualquier tipo de operativo de aplicación de la ley de inmigración que se lleve a cabo en lugares sensibles protegidos bajo estas excepciones. El presidente Trump ha tratado de intimidar a las comunidades atacando y deportando a los inmigrantes de manera indiscriminada, pero este proyecto de ley ayudará a codificar los límites de sentido común en los operativos de ICE y a proteger los derechos básicos de los inmigrantes vulnerables "", dijo el congresista Serrano.   ""La implementación agresiva de las políticas xenófobas y antiinmigrantes del presidente Trump por parte de ICE crea miedo y ansiedad en nuestras comunidades"", dijo el congresista Beyer. ""Los niños que asisten a la escuela, los pacientes que necesitan atención médica y las familias que van a la iglesia no deben dejar de ir a esos lugares por temor a que puedan ser el blanco de redadas de ICE. Me siento orgulloso de presentar este proyecto de ley que restringiría las actividades de ICE en estos lugares sensibles"".","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1844735889071743/?type=3",NA,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sus padres eran de ascendencia mexicana, y él padeció un racismo malicioso que lo llevó a desarrollar una carrera en derechos civiles. Después de servir con distinción en la Marina de los Estados Unidos, Chávez volvió a casa y comenzó a organizar a los trabajadores agrícolas para que pudieran hacer campaña por sus derechos.    A los 25 años, fundó la Organización de Servicios Comunitarios (OSC), que luchó por los derechos de los latinos, los derechos de los trabajadores, y utilizó la plataforma para subrayar la importancia de la educación y el derecho al voto. A la edad de 35 años, cofundó la Asociación Nacional de Trabajadores Agrícolas (NFWA), que luchó por un aumento salarial para los trabajadores del campo. A través de su trabajo en la NFWA, organizó un boicot a nivel nacional que duró cinco años y llamó la atención de Robert F. Kennedy, entonces miembro del Subcomité de Trabajo Migratorio.     El papel de Chávez en el movimiento por los derechos laborales inspiró la formación de sindicatos en el Medio Oeste para proteger los derechos laborales y, bajo este liderazgo, la Unión de Trabajadores Agrícolas de los Estados Unidos organizó a miles de trabajadores agrícolas migratorios para luchar por sus derechos civiles. Su eslogan ‘¡Sí, se puede!’, inspiró el del  presidente Barack Obama ‘¡Yes, we can!’, utilizado durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2008.   ""Cesar Chávez cambió para siempre la cultura estadounidense y su legado se extiende más allá de la agricultura para inspirar nuestros esfuerzos en defensa de los derechos humanos, los derechos laborales y el avance del Sueño Americano.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1845517802326885/?type=3",NA,7,2,15,0,0,0,0,0

We honor their sacrifice and courage when displaced and seeking safety for themselves and their families.   Last year, the international community recorded 65.6 million displaced people, refugees, and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution in every region of the world. Tragically, children account for 51 percent of refugees – millions of whom are unable to access basic services like education, setting back a generation of young minds.   Despite the many challenges that refugees face, the Trump Administration has consistently proposed divisive Executive Orders that make refugees feel unwelcome and unsafe here in America. A strong nation builds bridges, not walls and the actions of the Trump Administration do not reflect the ideals of America.   Leaving one’s country is a deadly mission, but often there is no other choice. On this World Refugee Day, we must recommit our work to address conflicts around the world that force people out of their homes and not turn our backs on refugees who have already experienced unimaginable violence and hardship.

Este movimiento puramente político del presidente tendría impactos desastrosos en nuestra economía y no haría nada para asegurar nuestras fronteras o arreglar nuestro roto sistema de inmigración.   ""Es inconcebible y no estadounidense que el presidente Trump esté considerando devastar el futuro de casi 800,000 jóvenes que encarnan la promesa de nuestra nación"", dijo el congresista Espaillat. ""La decisión del presidente de poner fin a DACA enviaría un mensaje escalofriante e iría en contra de la gran mayoría de los estadounidenses, quienes, sin importar su afiliación política, apoyan abrumadoramente que a estos jóvenes se les dé una oportunidad de alcanzar el Sueño Americano.   ""Desde que DACA fue creado, ha sido transformador para las vidas de jóvenes que no conocen ningún otro país que no sea los Estados Unidos y el programa ha producido ganancias económicas para las ciudades, los estados y nuestra nación en su conjunto. Matar este programa crítico forzaría a cientos de miles de jóvenes a salir del sistema laboral, afectaría sus vidas y las vidas de sus familias, crearía trastornos para las empresas y crisis en las economías de la mayoría de los estados.   ""El presidente debe pensarlo dos veces antes de traicionar a los jóvenes que se han presentado y aprobado los chequeos de antecedentes y por ello se les concedió permiso para vivir y trabajar legalmente en Estados Unidos. De hecho, el Sr. Trump debería estar acogiendo sus historias y contribuciones, no buscar maneras de socavar el lugar de estos jóvenes en el futuro de nuestra nación.   ""El presidente comentó anteriormente sobre la necesidad de manejar DACA con compasión y con corazón. Ahora es el momento de que el presidente Trump y su administración actúen sobre esas palabras y aseguren que casi 800,000 jóvenes no estén sujetos a la crueldad insensible de la deportación"".","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1914537998758198/?type=3",NA,3,1,0,0,0,2,0,0

We witnessed countless individuals charge back into smoke and flames to help their fellow New Yorkers, colleagues at the Pentagon, and passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 who sacrificed their lives. We are forever grateful to the first responders and all who volunteered to risk their lives and their long-term health during the rescue and recovery efforts.   As we reflect on the attacks of September 11th, we recommit ourselves and our work – regardless of political ideology, background, race, ethnicity, gender, orientation or citizenship status – to stand united, together and as one, in the face of terrorism that seeks to destroy our way of life, liberty and freedom that we hold dear as a country.   May God continue to bless our 9/11 families and first responders. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1918795948332403/?type=3",NA,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement today on federal efforts to provide relief to affected areas throughout the Caribbean in aftermath of Hurricane Maria.  “It is disappointing that President Trump spent the weekend attacking the NFL and top players of the NBA, and that he could not bother to lend a miniscule amount of support for Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the island of Dominica, the Virgin Islands, or any other nation affected by Hurricane Maria,” said Rep. Espaillat. “Since the beginning of this month, I have been beating the drum in Congress to call for supplemental emergency funding for the Caribbean in the aftermath of these recent catastrophic storms. The disaster relief funding that Congress has appropriated is not nearly enough to provide relief following the devastation. We need emergency hearings and swift action to ensure that the countries affected get the necessary assistance needed to rebuild and recover.   “Currently, Puerto Rico is without power, but it is not without hope. I am working with my colleagues in Congress to push for emergency funding, a one year extension of the Jones Act, and for the local cost-sharing to be waived.   “To my Dominican-American and Puerto Rican constituents: I am with you. I will keep fighting for you in Congress, and I will urge my colleagues to join me in these recovery efforts. My offices are in continuous communications with FEMA, and we stand ready to assist with your efforts to connect with your family back home. You are not alone.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEspaillat/photos/a.1808088626069803.1073741828.1808068199405179/1923808891164442/?type=3",NA,55,11,22,13,0,0,0,0

Much like civil rights and fellow human rights activists Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney who met a similar fate in Mississippi four years later during Freedom Summer, the Mirabal sisters found themselves ignominiously ambushed and killed by henchmen in the middle of the night along a dark, rural road while traveling from a remote location. Their courage and steadfastness, in the face of overbearing tyranny and oppression, must never be forgotten and forever celebrated.
