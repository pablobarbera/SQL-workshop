The SCRUB Act creates a regulatory review commission that will review and provide recommendations as to which regulations to repeal. The SCRUB Act also provides that for each new regulation there must be an equal repeal of an existing regulation implemented. Congressman Taylor had this to say about the SCRUB Act: “All across our district I heard loud and clear that businesses, small and large, have been suffocating under crushing regulations. Creating more accountability with the voters in the implementation of regulations is the right step”","link","https://taylor.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-scott-taylor-supports-scrub-act","taylor.house.gov",2,10,0,0,0,0,1,4

Thursday, I will vote YEA, in support of the American Health Care Act. Dealing with healthcare is a complicated and formidable task. However, it is one issue I knew I would face as a freshman Member of Congress. I was quite clear during my campaign for Congress that I supported repealing and replacing Obamacare.  It is failing. It is hurting more people than it’s helping. The law’s mandates, tax hikes, and regulations have led to skyrocketing premiums, fewer choices, and less access to quality care. The government should not require citizens to engage in commerce they do not want to engage in. Millions of people lost healthcare plans they wanted to keep. Healthcare premiums have skyrocketed as have deductibles for too many families. People are making tough decisions with some premiums costing as much as mortgage payments. Others are walking around with insurance cards with deductibles they cannot afford. Insurers are pulling out of markets, leaving monopolies behind. The government is taking in more tax revenue than at any time in our nation’s history –  regulations are crushingly burdensome on individuals and businesses and will only increase moving forward under Obamacare. The list of reasons for repeal goes on.   The AHCA vote this Thursday is the first step toward patient-centered healthcare. After all, NO ONE cares more about your healthcare than you or your family. The AHCA is the start of three phases: the budget reconciliation process to repeal Obamacare taxes, executive action to provide waivers to the States and other rule changes, and more legislation to fully enact our improvements, including allowing people to buy insurance across state lines.  This is sure to be an ongoing process and not a simplistic one.  Under the AHCA, those who cannot help themselves are still protected. The bill provides states with $100 billion to design programs that meet the unique needs of their patient populations and help low-income Americans access affordable health care. States would also have the ability to add work requirements for able-bodied, working age adults. The bill repeals Obamacare taxes and the forced mandate, it increases the limits of tax-free Health Savings Accounts, and it keeps the ACA requirement for insurance policies to cover maternity care and contraception, and cancer screening. Those with pre-existing conditions are covered and parents can still keep their adult children on their plans until age 26. Finally, this legislation reduces the federal deficit by $337 billion by reducing spending by $1.2 trillion and providing nearly $900 billion in tax relief, including for middle-income Americans and small business owners.  This reconciliation bill is a step in the right direction.  There will be more changes by way of executive action and further legislation that cannot be enacted as part of the AHCA because of arcane Senate rules.   I am supporting this legislation that, when combined with the other actions we will take, provides a meaningful positive difference for American families. There are those who say this bill doesn’t do 100 percent of what they want it to do; I believe 85 percent of something in the right direction is much better than nothing.","link","https://taylor.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-scott-taylor-statement-ahca","taylor.house.gov",21,141,8,1,1,0,17,87

My first 100 days have been busy, but also filled with excitement about what we are going to accomplish in the months to come. The promise of a better tomorrow for our families, communities, and nation is a constant reminder that we still have much work to do. I am committed to finding solutions that benefit the American people by creating a stronger economy, supporting our military, and making sure that our government listens to the people it is supposed to help. I want to share with you some facts about our first 100 days so you know what we are doing in Washington and at home to help you.  I have personally held over 165 meetings with constituents to hear about the issues affecting Virginia’s Second Congressional District. I have co-sponsored over 26 pieces of legislation from improving access to veteran care to condemning the UN resolution that sought to undermine Israel to promoting STEM career opportunities for women. The bills I have introduced deal with a wide range of issues from cybersecurity to increased accountability at the VA, as well as promoting equal access to housing for LGBTQ citizens and strengthening homeland security protections by ensuring that uniforms for DHS personnel are made right here, at home. More information on these bills can be found here.   In the wake of the President’s budget proposal, I have written two letters – one to the President, and one to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Environment and the Interior – stressing the importance of funding for the Chesapeake Bay and the vital role it plays in our economy and our environment. At the end of last month, I submitted an appropriations request to fully restore the $73 million of funding that the President omitted from his budget.   My staff in Virginia has been busy advocating on your behalf to federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, the IRS, and the VA. We have helped over 300 constituents so far with issues related to compensation for service-connected disabilities for veterans, tax disputes, expediting passports, and much more. Please contact my office in Virginia Beach if you ever need assistance with a federal agency. We stand ready to assist.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepScottTaylor/photos/a.1893999430877573.1073741828.1831393353804848/1920085468268969/?type=3",NA,9,19,8,0,7,0,0,0

Rep. Taylor on our side All of us who love the Chesapeake Bay breathed a sigh of relief when Rep. Scott Taylor recently went to bat for the bay in Congress. The president's budget has proposed eliminating funding for the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program, threatening to reverse all the progress made in restoring our waters. Fortunately, the House Appropriations Committee recently supported restoring $60 million to the bay program, still shy of the current level of $73 million (""House committee votes to slash Chesapeake Bay cleanup by $13 million,"" July 19). However, this is a promising first sign from Congress. Rep. Taylor championed the bay program to the committee, rightly calling the Chesapeake a ""national treasure,"" and vowed to continue to push for full funding as Congress finalizes the budget. The result? Committee leadership committed to work with him as the process goes forward. It is heartening to see this region's strong bipartisan push for the bay. Recently, Congressman Bobby Scott planted oysters on the Lafayette River, while Congressman Rob Wittman joined constituents on Clean the Bay Day. Rep. Don McEachin has urged support for bay restoration. Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine are defending the bay Ppogram on the other side of Capitol Hill. The future of the bay program is critical to our future here in Hampton Roads. All of us who enjoy local seafood, fishing, boating and swimming should applaud members of Congress fighting to keep bay restoration alive. They are making a strong showing, and the bases are loaded. Let's cheer them on so they can bring it home.

But our response has been even bigger and continues to grow every hour. Right now, thousands of Americans are donating time, money, and effort to help the victims of this tragic storm. Many of you are probably wondering how you can get involved and help with the disaster relief efforts currently underway in Texas. I have provided below information from FEMA about how you can donate or personally volunteer in the affected regions. Make no mistake, the recovery period for this disaster will be measured in years, not weeks or months. But the help we give to the people of Texas will be measured by the size of our hearts. Therefore, I encourage everyone reading this to take a moment and consider lending a hand to the people seeking shelter, supplies, and warm clothes.

There is now a bill being generated in the Congressional committee of jurisdiction to do just that. The Net Neutrality vote by the FCC today was to remove over burdensome regulations that stifle innovation, investment, and a free internet. Here is a great article/explanation on the vote today.","link","https://stratechery.com/2017/pro-neutrality-anti-title-ii/","stratechery.com",92,102,16,6,1,3,2,47

Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore are home to thousands of federal employees, contractors, and military personnel, representing the second largest population center at risk from sea level rise impact. Providing a national designation for institutions that offer quality research and analysis, such as Old Dominion University, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and the Virginia Coastal Policy Center at the College of William and Mary, is the first step toward combatting the potentially devastating effects of sea level rise on our communities, infrastructure, and military capabilities.”","link","https://taylor.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-scott-taylor-and-colleagues-introduce-bill-designating-national","taylor.house.gov",44,24,1,1,0,1,0,0
