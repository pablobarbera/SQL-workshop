With that in mind, I refuse to be a pawn in the president-elect’s efforts to rally support from congressional Republicans. As a proud Democrat, I want President-elect Trump to see me front and center as he’s sworn in. I want him to see exactly what his opposition looks like. When he sees me, I want him to see The Resistance.   I did not come to this decision lightly. I weighed my responsibility as an elected official against my disgust over the president-elect's vile tactics employed to ascend to the presidency and the disrespectful treatment of revered civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis. I considered the multitude of supportive phone calls and tweets from my constituents in light of the embarrassing and ongoing petulance employed by the president-elect. I prayed on this and thought of First Lady Michelle Obama as she reminded us to refrain from abandoning decency in the face of intolerance and moral depravity.   It’s no secret that I find President-elect Trump and his policies repugnant and anathema to my efforts to pursue social justice, and I know a majority of my constituents feel the same. In November, Milwaukee sent a strong, clear message that Donald Trump was the wrong man to lead our country.

Trump took office is a pernicious wave of nationalism, racism, misogyny, and antisemitism. Rather than detailing a plan to quell the violence and vandalism perpetrated by those who feel emboldened by his actions, President Trump touted his own perceived success while feigning concern for bipartisanship and unity.  Much like his campaign, President Trump’s speech emphasized flash over substance, failing to provide tangible policy proposals to match his boasts and taking credit for the success of President Barack Obama. I found the president’s words empty and indicative of a weak person's idea of what strength looks like. Not only did he fail to mention the fate of critical social safety programs that will undoubtedly suffer in the face of the president’s military spending increase, but it was also clear that vital issues like gender-based violence simply weren’t a concern of his administration.  I find it incredulous that President Trump could claim a commitment to national security while failing to even mention how we will protect our nation’s women and daughters, especially when an average of three women are killed by a current or former partner every day in our country. Fortunately, Deborah Parker was by my side tonight as my guest to help stress our shared moral imperative to safeguard our nation’s most vulnerable.

It made incredible strides in addressing the gaps in our country’s health care infrastructure, from barring insurance companies from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions to ending deductibles and co-pays on preventive services such as mammograms, immunizations, and pre-natal care.   The Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA not only destroys the progress achieved during President Obama’s tenure, but it also manufactures new health care crises that will have a devastating impact on seniors, women, and working- and middle-class Americans. This bill is a self-inflicted wound that will exacerbate costs, limit protections, and hurt the 70 million Americans who rely on Medicaid, including pregnant women and vulnerable children. But low-income Americans aren’t the only ones who will bear the financial brunt of such corrosive legislation. It is important to recognize that everyone – regardless of their socioeconomic background – will foot the bill for this misguided proposal.   I am particularly disturbed by the effect this legislation will have on women’s health. In addition to defunding Planned Parenthood – a vital health care organization that many of my constituents depend on – this bill also aims to dismantle the private insurance market for abortion coverage, a procedure that, out of pocket, can cost tens of thousands of dollars. As this legislation moves through the House of Representatives, rest assured I will be voicing my strident opposition to it and any proposal that values politics over patients.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/gop-obamacare-replacement-bill-wreaks-havoc-on-women-children-and-lowincome-americans/","gwenmoore.house.gov",77,20,13,8,0,2,3,16

As alarming as this comment was, it became even more disturbing today as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell candidly acknowledged that he didn’t believe Mexico would reimburse the United States for the Southern border wall. As this signature policy platform of President Donald J. Trump swiftly unravels, I see both a moral and fiscal imperative to shield my constituents and the programs they depend on from footing the bill for this costly proposal.    To ensure President Trump doesn’t saddle the financial burden of his misguided campaign promise on the backs of those struggling to get by, I recently introduced The No Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act of 2017. My legislation holds the president to his word to have the government of Mexico fund his border wall and prevents him and congressional Republicans from using money for vital services like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Violence Against Women Act grants to fund this absurd plan.   As a proud member of the opposition party, I have no illusions as to our current political reality in the House of Representatives. If Republicans capitulate to President Trump, a wall will indeed be built. But if this ludicrous proposal does come to fruition, I will do everything in my power as a member of Congress to protect my constituents from the financial fallout. I call on both Democrats and Republicans to join me in my effort by supporting this commonsense legislation.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/moore-introduces-bill-shielding-taxpayers-from-funding-president-trumps-border-wall/","gwenmoore.house.gov",312,44,91,46,0,1,0,9

Trump has deliberately courted the most extreme elements of the alt-right and conservative movements through cavalier assurances to wreak havoc on government agencies and initiatives without regard for the consequences. He vowed to address the most pressing issues facing communities across the country. Instead, he is dismantling the progress made over the past eight years. To date, his administration has targeted the Environmental Protection Agency, Wall Street regulators, and the safety net programs intended to help people in need. Today, we saw the next dangerous step in his misguided agenda.   The release of the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2018 Budget has already prompted numerous calls of concern from my constituents. Not only do they see the harm inherent in this proposal, but they fear for their families’ future in the face of such extreme funding cuts. They recognize that the taxpayer dollars at risk help them secure a roof over their heads, provide women in poverty with access to health care services from Planned Parenthood, and ensure future generations can enjoy Lake Michigan — one of our district’s most prized natural resources. Even our senior citizens may lose out, as the funding supporting the Meals on Wheels program is gutted.       This budget is symptomatic of an administration with total disregard for our most vulnerable, especially as students in poverty lose out on opportunities for higher education, communities of color suffer the loss of development grants, and working-class families go without the energy assistance programs that keep them warm during the coldest of seasons. Fighting these cutbacks will not be easy, but if we work together, we can enact a budget that protects these programs and provides economic opportunities and healthy outcomes for all Americans.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/trump-budget-blueprint-to-cause-irreparable-damage-to-working-and-middleclass-americans/","gwenmoore.house.gov",71,18,17,2,0,1,12,48

Despite my trepidation about meeting with a man who consistently displays disdain and ignorance toward minorities, I saw this meeting as an opportunity to educate President Trump on the unique obstacles and experiences African-Americans face every day in this country.  We met with President Trump to express our concerns over a disturbing trend of disregard for our communities and to convey our collective alarm over his proposed budget and policy agenda. I entered the meeting with a healthy dose of skepticism and left the White House with a sense of cautious optimism, but only time will tell if the president and his advisors are willing to take action on our recommendations. For the sake of every constituent who is far too familiar with the sting of racism and discrimination, living in communities that are underserved and overpoliced, I truly hope our words didn’t fall on deaf ears.

Despite claims from the White House’s Chief Economic Advisor that such a proposal will stimulate growth and create jobs, it is clear that the only result of this plan will be a steep increase in our country’s deficit while leaving working- and middle class families in the dust.    We’ve seen these bad ideas before and the reality never matches the rhetoric. Recently, Kansas implemented comparable business tax ideas, and the outcome was a stagnant economy, a downgraded credit rating, and a fiscal crisis that will plague the state for generations to come.  President Donald J. Trump is also proposing a ""tax holiday"" for businesses, to bring money back to the U.S. that has been kept sheltered overseas. President George W. Bush implemented the same idea in 2004, but it failed miserably in creating economic growth. There was no investment in employees, infrastructure, or expansion; rather, the special tax rates were used to enrich corporate shareholders.   The president’s tax outline fails to address any safeguards to stop abusive corporate practices like earnings stripping, transfer pricing, or corporate inversions. Put simply, this effort clears the way for corporations to abuse wide-open tax loopholes. I am more than willing to engage with my colleagues across the aisle, but I simply cannot support tax reform that so blatantly favors the wealthiest individuals and entities in our country while completely ignoring the rest of us.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/trump-tax-plan-prioritizes-super-wealthy-over-the-working-and-middle-class/","gwenmoore.house.gov",37,8,21,0,1,2,1,22

However, his testimony — albeit candid and informative — leaves my constituents with a host of unanswered questions regarding both President Trump’s campaign and the Trump administration’s ties to Russia.  As dark clouds continue to cast shadows on the Trump Administration, I find myself taken aback by the GOP’s outright refusal to hold the president accountable for his misconduct. Such an abdication of leadership by Speaker Paul Ryan and his Republican colleagues only serves to compound the damage President Trump has inflicted on our democracy and further erodes our standing in the global community.  The demands of constituents across America for transparency and accountability have been ignored by this White House. Now, more than ever, our country needs an outside independent commission to determine the full extent of Russia’s interference in our democratic process.

Yet, as President Donald J. Trump has demonstrated during his short tenure, such progress is fragile and susceptible to attack, underscoring the need for us to remain vigilant and visible.   President Trump has made no illusions regarding his indifference to our shared struggle for LGBT equality. Only months into his first term, the president has withdrawn civil protections and rights for over 1.4 million transgender Americans, erased LGBT identifications from data collection, and appointed several outspoken anti-LGBT personnel to key positions to his administration. And just this week, rather than acknowledging LGBT Pride Month, President Trump decided to address anti-LGBT leaders at the conservative Road to Majority conference.  I refuse to sit on the sidelines as the president and his party wage their ideological war on the LGBT community. Earlier this year, I co-sponsored numerous legislative efforts aimed at establishing new protections for sexuality and gender identity, including the Voices for Veterans Act, a bill that would expand the membership of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to include LGBT veterans. Knowing that our fight for equality must extend beyond our own borders, I recently joined 50 of my congressional colleagues in calling on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to condemn the detention, torture, and murders of gay and bisexual men in Chechnya.   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle must come together to fight prejudice and discrimination locally, nationally, and globally. Let us use LGBT Pride Month as a call to action to every American to acknowledge our own freedoms and recognize that when everyone is treated as equal, only then can we truly be free.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/as-we-celebrate-lgbt-pride-month-action-on-equality-must-continue/","gwenmoore.house.gov",107,3,11,17,2,0,0,0

Trump’s failure to offer a sensible plan to address our deteriorating infrastructure during his so-called ""Infrastructure Week."" Rather than submitting a practical plan of action, the president advocated for a host of massive tax breaks to billionaires, representing yet another broken promise to hard-working Americans who were assured an economy that works for everyone.   Wisconsinites are no strangers to infrastructure problems. In our state, driving on roads in need of repair costs each driver $637 every year, drinking water needs are estimated to be as high as $1 billion, high hazard ratings have been given to 157 dams, and 8.7% of bridges are rated structurally deficient. With both President Trump and Governor Scott Walker willfully ignoring such critical issues, 50 of my congressional colleagues and I have signed onto the Millions of Jobs Coalition’s Congressional Resolution, calling for a real infrastructure plan that prioritizes clean job creation, public investment, and racial and gender equality.    Every legislative effort of this administration appears to underscore its commitment to looking good rather than doing good, from its push to privatize Air Traffic Control to a federal budget that only provides for a $200 billion infrastructure investment, far short from the $1 trillion-dollar investment promised months earlier. By cutting the Highway Trust Fund by $96 billion and eliminating TIGER grants – which have provided billions in transportation grants across the nation – the president has made it abundantly clear that working- and middle-class Americans were sold a bill of goods during his campaign for the White House.      The American public needs much more than President Trump’s broken promises. They need a bipartisan-led direct public investment in our nation’s crumbling infrastructure and that’s what I will continue to fight for in Congress.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/trump-administration-fails-to-address-americas-infrastructure-needs/","gwenmoore.house.gov",36,3,5,0,0,0,3,11

It has been 152 years since word of emancipation reached Texas, the last state in the union to free its slaves. Yet, in our country, those from communities of color are still subject to vestiges of slavery in the form of deeply rooted racism and discrimination. While it is essential to celebrate the progress we have made in making America a more equitable and just place to call home, it critical to continue to fight existing systems of oppression and injustice.    Days ago, St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who shot and killed Philano Castile, was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter charges. Unlike his victim, Officer Yanez was able to leave a courtroom and return home to his loved ones. The ongoing pattern of unconscionable police shootings sends a stark message to young Black children that law enforcement officials can kill them with utter impunity. However, despite setbacks, I remain deeply committed to addressing and fixing such inequality in our justice system with our local, state, and national partners.    I am proud of the progress we have made in the last 152 years. I am proud that Milwaukeeans marked this historic day with their 44th annual ""Day of Jubilee"" parade.

And with children out of school and jobs in short supply, parents across my congressional district fear their loved ones will be involved in a tragic interaction with a police officer. Their alarm is justified. As a mother and grandmother of Black children, such anxiety is all too familiar.   Next month will mark a year since civil unrest and city-wide protests erupted in Milwaukee after the fatal police-involved shooting of Sylville Smith. For years, I have racked my brain trying to understand deaths like that of Mr. Smith, Dontre Hamilton, and Philando Castile. I have grieved with mothers who have lost their children. I have met with experts and attended roundtables in my ongoing efforts to put an end to these fatal encounters.    Today, I proposed a legislative solution to this national problem we can all support, regardless of party affiliation or political ideology. H.R. 3060, the Preventing Tragedies Between Police and Communities Act of 2017 – which draws from several ‘best practices’ and recommendations from the nonpartisan Police Executive Research Forum – federally mandates de-escalation training for law enforcement officials. Through enhanced training and preparation, we can equip police with the necessary tools and education to prevent violent interactions, saving not only their lives, but also the lives of the civilians they serve.     The Dallas Police Department has employed de-escalation training with great success. Since changing their training to emphasize de-escalation rather than confrontation, the number of complaints alleging excessive and improper use of force fell from 147 in 2009 to 13 in November of 2015. In the face of a strained relationship between police and civilians nationwide, Dallas was able to implement reforms that reduced their rate of police-related shootings to one of the lowest of any large city in America.    It is my sincere hope to replicate Dallas’ success across the country. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to prioritize the preservation of life by supporting this bill.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/moore-reintroduces-bill-to-prevent-violent-altercations-between-police-and-civilians/","gwenmoore.house.gov",199,20,28,41,2,4,0,0

We’ve talked a lot about the 22-23 million people who will lose their healthcare if we were to repeal and replace Obamacare. But the Senate healthcare bill goes deeper than this. It undermines the Medicaid program—a program that would be 52 years old on July 30, if it survives.   Right now, Mr. Speaker, there are 70 million people who rely on Medicaid. Let me tell you right now, Mr. Speaker, one of those people could be you. The average age of the member of the House of Representatives is 57. The average age of a Senator is 61. So, Mr. Speaker, you are one stroke away, one heart attack away from becoming disabled. After they wipe out your IRA, your pension, and your social security, you too, Mr. Speaker, could end up relying on Medicaid to have a decent end of life experience or be able to stay at home. You’re one kidney failure away, one car accident away, even though you make $179,000 a year. Mr. Speaker, if you were to have a disabled child who needed extensive care, you wouldn’t have enough money. You would depend on the Medicaid program.   Many people don’t care about what’s going on here. They think it couldn’t happen to them. Most people think the 70 million people who rely on Medicaid are people other than them. But no Mr. Speaker, it’s you. And even if you don’t – God willing – have a stroke or a heart attack, you’re someone who will suffer from the cost shifting. When 22 million people lose their health care, your premiums are going to go up. Your deductibles are going to go up.   God forbid that you have arthritis or another pre-existing condition, because under this bill, you’ll be left at the tender mercies of our insurance companies where they can charge five times as much for seniors or someone who has a pre-existing condition. Hospitals in your nice suburban, rural area may find themselves being shut down because they don’t get Medicaid payments. Community health centers included, not just Planned Parenthood, Mr. Speaker, but those community health centers that serve rural communities.   How cruel could a bill be where 50% of the children born in this country rely on Medicaid? How cruel could a bill be when there are seven million people with disabilities in this country? After we end the entitlement to Medicaid, we will have people with disabilities, children, and those who need skilled nursing care, fighting with each other. They will have to win the lottery in order to access the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.  Mr. Speaker, this bill will have an impact on you. It’s not just poor people, it’s everybody. All Americans, every American, relies on decent good healthcare. This is the largest healthcare program in our country that is about to be dismantled. I caution everyone, especially you, Mr. Speaker, to beware.","link","https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4675035%2Fcongresswoman-moore-opposes-trumpcare-medicaid-cuts","c-span.org",96,16,29,21,0,3,1,0

But all too often, there are vast discrepancies between the values we publicly express and the values demonstrated through our actions. Nothing demonstrates such flagrant inconsistencies more than the 2018 House Republican budget proposal currently before congress.   In May, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney took to Fox News to assure the American people that, ""Republicans care about poor people. Republicans care about kids. Republicans care about the elderly."" Yet, with trillions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and the offensive imposition of work requirements on those who rely on social welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, it is abundantly clear the House Republican budget greatly contradicts Director Mulvaney’s claim.   Such an insensitive and draconian approach to our budget, coupled with the trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of essential health, infrastructure, and jobs programs, speaks volumes as to who Republicans truly care about.

Trump to take part in today’s White House announcement regarding the construction of a Foxconn manufacturing facility in Wisconsin. While I am relieved to learn my state could potentially see an influx of jobs because of this project, my constituents have no interest in me entertaining the president’s desire to be used as a backdrop in his photo op. Rather, I will be using this time to answer questions from constituents and local organizations as part of today’s Congressional Black Caucus Twitter Town Hall on Trumpcare.    Too often, Americans are promised by those they elect that job creation is just beyond the horizon, only to discover that such assurances are merely an attempt to win elections. As a candidate for governor, Scott Walker promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in four years. After more than six years in office, Wisconsinites are still waiting for Governor Walker to follow through on his word. The same can be said for President Trump who notably worked with Carrier last year in an effort prevent the shuttering of plants across the country. Nearly seven months after the president declared victory and assured Carrier employees their jobs were safe, we’ve learned hundreds will soon be laid off. Despite their broken promises, I truly believe Wisconsin’s workers, combined with our state’s world-class education system, make the Badger State the best place for businesses to invest, and I approach today’s Foxconn announcement with cautious optimism.   Americans don’t need politicians taking public victory laps with nothing to show for it. As President Trump and Governor Walker smile for the cameras, I’ll be with the Congressional Black Caucus taking questions from Americans whose lives would be put at risk under Trumpcare.

Now is the time for those who have yet to feel the sting of oppression and intolerance to unite with us in amplifying our collective voices against those who proudly brandish the hateful symbolism embraced by the likes of David Duke and Dylan Roof. Our coalition against hate is strong, but only when those who experience and benefit from privilege join us can we truly be an unstoppable force.   White supremacy, our nation’s original sin, has always held a prominent role in the African American experience. However, we aren’t alone in our endeavor to combat domestic terrorism. Jews, Muslims, LGBTQ individuals, and other marginalized groups have a long and rich history of standing shoulder to shoulder with us as part of our shared efforts to extinguish the flames of racism and extremist views of white nationalism. Their partnership echoes the words of Elie Wiesel who urged us to take sides and reminded us that, ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.""   The vile expressions of hate that occurred in Charlottesville, while surprising to some, evoked all too familiar feelings of vulnerability and anger for my constituents and communities of color. Such vitriol demanded nothing less than our country’s strongest and immediate condemnation, starting with the president. But when initially presented with the opportunity to reject white supremacy and address the ongoing scourge of hate aimed at intimidating and terrorizing us, we were offered vague objections and unattributed press statements.    In the face of days of public admonishment by leaders on both sides of the aisle, the President of the United States finally condemned those whose actions led to the death of Heather Heyer.

They are a vital part of our nation’s fabric, and they must be defended. Yet, their fate is now uncertain as President Donald Trump prepares to end DACA, the program that allowed 800,000 DREAMers to come out of the shadows and establish roots in the country they call home. As we await a decision from the White House, it is imperative to emphasize the local and national consequences of shuttering such a critical program.   Most DREAMers have known no other home than the United States. The vast majority of DACA-eligible students over the age of 18 received a high school education here. Our nation has made an investment in their future that not only transformed their lives, but also had widespread economic benefits for all of us. Turning our backs on that investment and ending DACA isn’t just morally reprehensible, but it could also cost the country up to 700,000 jobs and $460.3 billion in economic output over the next decade. If Wisconsin’s 6,582 DACA workers are deported, it  would cost the state more than $400 million annually.   As the Trump administration continues to push a truly un-American agenda of discrimination and mass deportation, Congress must unite to protect DACA, its recipients, and their families. Today and always, I stand with my Democratic colleagues fighting to protect DACA and pass comprehensive immigration reform.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/congress-must-unite-to-protect-daca/","gwenmoore.house.gov",80,11,9,21,1,0,4,0

The opening of Planned Parenthood’s new Water St. Center facility in Milwaukee not only represents the welcomed addition of another trusted health care provider in our community, but also underscores Planned Parenthood’s ongoing and unwavering commitment to the well-being of my constituents. In the face of intentional, targeted attacks on our reproductive rights, Milwaukee is fortunate that Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and its supporters have once again rallied together to provide essential health services.   The opening of Planned Parenthood’s new facility is especially significant as women across the country continue to have their reproductive rights targeted by the White House and the GOP. In what can only be described as another callous attempt to undermine women, House Republicans recently passed a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks. Days later, the White House announced they would allow employers to discriminate against women by denying insurance coverage for birth control. And just yesterday, President Trump issued an Executive Order endangering women by jeopardizing basic health coverage such as maternity, newborn, and preventative care, and announced his intent to end the Affordable Care Act’s cost-sharing reductions that make health care accessible for millions of Americans.   Women across the ideological spectrum are rightfully disgusted by the ongoing efforts of those who seek to control our reproductive freedom. Fortunately, organizations like Planned Parenthood continue to demonstrate their willingness to be there for members of our community, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. Not only will their new facility serve as a place for patients to receive family planning services, wellness screenings, and sex education, but it also serves as symbol of resilience.

Despite condemnation by those in their own party, Republicans narrowly passed what can only be described as a reckless and dangerous bill that will reshape our economy and deal an immense blow to critical services like Medicaid and Medicare.    In passing this spiteful resolution, the GOP once again turned its back on a group of Americans too often overlooked in the halls of Congress: the single, working-class mother. With her in mind, I forcefully voted against this bill as the trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy will come at the expense of the very programs that help her escape poverty. Threatening essential health programs for the most vulnerable as a means to satisfy President Trump’s wild campaign promises reflects nothing but contempt for women who are simply trying to provide for their families.   Our shared failure to invest in these women with robust contributions to health services, child care, and vocational training cannot be understated.

Needless to say, this news is deeply disturbing as the alleged hazard zones fall in densely populated residential neighborhoods putting the health and well-being of thousands at risk.   Today’s announcement not only stresses the need for enhanced transparency in the private sector, but it also underscores the necessity for press freedom and a responsive EPA that can hold companies accountable for breaking laws that protect the public. Since assuming office, those like Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt have done everything in their power to cripple the EPA’s regulatory capacity and vilify the media. Fortunately, press outlets like the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel have been working diligently to investigate corporate polluters like Greif Industries and shed light on their potentially dangerous practices.   As a member of Congress, nothing is more important to me than securing the safety of my constituents. With this in mind, I encourage the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Material’s Safety Administration, as well as other applicable state and federal agencies, to continue to work to protect our communities from this threat and ensure Grief Industries promptly complies with federal law. As agencies move forward with the enforcement mechanisms available, I will continue to work with federal stakeholders and all relevant parties to ensure our residents have access to information about any potential environmental hazards they may have been exposed to.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/epa-finds-local-industrial-refurbishing-plants-in-violation-of-federal-law/","gwenmoore.house.gov",26,7,8,2,0,5,0,1

This reckless Republican tax bill not only represents a deep misunderstanding of that responsibility, but also exposes the extent of their indifference to the struggles of poor and working class families.  The GOP tax scam betrays every tenet of responsible governing and meaningful reform. It further complicates the tax code and creates even more loopholes for their corporate donors. When fully implemented, their plan will raise taxes on every single income group making less than $75,000 per year. Of the advertised tax benefits, 83% will go to the top 1% of taxpayers.   It’s no secret that CEOs have already stated their intention of passing these tax cuts to their shareholders rather than creating jobs or raising wages. Our constituents are rightfully sick and tired of these empty promises, trickle-down myths, and attempts to chip away at the bedrock safety net programs upon which they depend. That’s why I’ll continue to fight for policies that truly grow our economy and support the needs of regular Americans.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2585","gwenmoore.house.gov",54,26,13,3,0,1,2,25

Moore","2017-12-20","2017-12-20 16:19:18","I applaud the decision of both Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee in ending the misguided nomination of Scott Garrett, President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Export-Import Bank of the United States. There is little doubt that Garret, who worked tirelessly to shut down the Bank during his tenure in Congress, would have worked from within to destroy this vital institution, forcing hard-working Americans to pay the price.  As a proven job creator that drives nationwide economic growth, I take comfort in knowing there is bipartisan consensus on the need to confirm a nominee who recognizes the role the Bank plays in strengthening our economy. Over the last 10 years, the Ex-Im Bank supported over 1.7 million American jobs. This year alone in Wisconsin, the Bank enabled the export of $181 million goods and services.  The Bank has been unquestionably successful in supporting American jobs and leveling the international playing field for American manufacturers. However, it remains to be seen if President Trump will answer the bipartisan calls for him to nominate someone who will bring the Bank back to its full potential. For the sake of American exports and the ability of US workers to compete in the global economy, I hope he does.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2587","gwenmoore.house.gov",31,5,2,2,0,0,0,0

Moore","2017-12-20","2017-12-20 20:41:53","For far too long, America’s criminal justice system has failed to protect those who have fallen victim to human trafficking. In order to substantively combat this pervasive and complex issue, local and federal law enforcement officials must have the tools and training necessary to identify and respond to human trafficking in all of its forms. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017 not only addresses these concerns, but also builds upon the progress of the Violence Against Women Act to strengthen existing laws and grant federal agencies the capacity to provide critical services to trafficking survivors. During a time in our national politics when sensible legislation is regularly stymied by partisan entrenchment, I take great pride in the work Congressman Erik Paulsen and I have achieved in developing a bipartisan approach to end this form of modern-day slavery.","link","https://gwenmoore.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2589","gwenmoore.house.gov",35,6,4,7,0,1,0,0
