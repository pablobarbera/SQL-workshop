Obamacare has failed. It took an already dysfunctional healthcare economy and made it worse. The list of broken promises to fix our healthcare system with the law is long. Rather than fall by $2,500, premiums rose by $4,300, a difference of $6,800. It did not allow Americans to keep their insurance if they liked it. It did not allow Americans to keep their doctor. This is just the first step. Congress must swiftly replace Obamacare with reforms that respect the Constitution and individual liberty.   I do, however have concerns with the budget trajectory this bill establishes.  Leadership in Congress has assured us that today’s vote is simply a vehicle for repealing Obamacare and that future budgets will reflect the fiscal discipline the American people expect of Congress.

The Obama Administration rule threatened to result in the withholding of $3 million in funding for Ohio if the state does not comply.     As I have said before, Planned Parenthood should not receive a dime of federal funding. As the congressional investigation found, they traffic baby parts for profit.  The Washington Post debunked the myth that Planned Parenthood provides mammograms. As a recent Live Action investigation showed, Planned Parenthood claims to offer prenatal care enticing women to visit their offices and then won’t offer an ultrasound unless the woman commits to killing their child. Ohio did the right thing by redirecting funding away from Planned Parenthood. I am proud to vote today to stand up for Ohio and other states’ ability to redirect funding away from the abortion industry led by Planned Parenthood.  This vote today is also a victory for states. Legislators and state officials know Ohio’s health care needs better than federal bureaucrats. I look forward to this resolution being signed into law so that Ohio’s laws will be respected.

President Trump covered a lot of topics.  This was a great look ahead for our country's 250th anniversary. Good tone of working together to make America more peaceful, more just, and more free.  On overall speech: I agree with the president’s primary message that America’s best days are ahead of us. The first thing lawmakers must accomplish is to follow through on our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Congress passed a repeal in the past, and we should do so again. We must be bold, and not succumb to half measures that keep key pillars of Obamacare or create new programs in their wake.   On national security: It is refreshing to hear a president that finally understands the importance of protecting our soldiers in harm's way and providing the funding, training, and equipment they need to achieve their mission.  Likewise, Americans deserve to be safe at home. We must restore law and order, secure our borders, and enforce our laws. I look forward to voting on these measures to ensure Americans are safe at home and abroad.  On economy and debt: President Trump gets it. At the end of the day, what is most important to Americans’ financial security is a good paying job. I look forward to working with him on ways to get the government out of the way and unleash American workers. Tax reform will play an important part in this. Our $20 trillion debt will strangle our economy unless addressed, and growth through tax reform is a key part of tackling this debt. I am optimistic that President Trump takes this seriously.","status",NA,NA,228,53,19,16,0,0,0,7

If we are going to have a vibrant Main Street economy, we cannot continue to grow Washington’s economy at the expense of the next generation.  Ultimately, President Trump’s proposal shows that he takes our debt problem seriously, and I hope this is the start of a trend. It is not compassionate to bankrupt America. To avoid that fate, I look forward to collaborating with others to address the whole pie, not only this discretionary slice.

I displayed a chart which clearly demonstrates in the past eight years, we experienced the opposite with exploding deficits.  I asked Dr. Goodfriend, former Director of Research at the Richmond Federal Reserve, if these deficits matter. He made an excellent point. He argued that deficits matter because they represent taxing in the future rather than the present. Taxing in the future is just as harmful as the present in that it creates a hurdle for current investment that bears fruit in the future. This has been one of the biggest obstacles in this recovery.  It is not compassionate to bankrupt America. I look forward to working with my colleagues to reverse this trend.

It is shameful that the House could not produce and pass a bill this week that reflected these commitments.  In fact, as we made progress toward those commitments, the current bill lost votes. Republicans must now go back to the drawing board, together, to formulate a plan that does what we promised and can garner broad Republican support.   People often ask about my biggest surprise in Congress. Normally, my answer is that there are no whiteboards. Whiteboards are used to collaborate and solve problems. This setback shows that Republicans need more collaboration, not less. The path to this ‘binary choice’ with no amendments and an artificial deadline, driven by an anniversary date rather than progress on the bill, have caused this pause. This delay must not be fatal to our commitment to solve the health care problem by honoring the promises Republicans have made in every election since 2010.  Despite this setback, I appreciate the willingness of President Donald Trump to work together throughout this process. I was stunned to see as we made progress toward repealing Obamacare’s one-size fits all approach, others lost their resolve. We are duty bound to honor the promises we made. The American people are counting on us to repeal Obamacare and enact policies that lower their health care costs. I remain hopeful that we can accomplish this mission.","status",NA,NA,263,215,25,8,1,1,2,15

By a vote of 416 to 7, the House passed HR 372 – the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017.  This bill seeks to end the anti-trust exemptions (ability to block out competitors and fix prices) that health insurance companies use to keep prices high, options limited, and competitors out of markets.    Why did a bill that passed so easily take so long to get done?  Because it would pass, which may be instructive about the agenda on Capitol Hill.  We need to change the status quo in Washington, and in our healthcare economy. Paul Gosar’s (AZ) bill was a big step in the right direction on both counts.  Now we need to keep pressure on the Senate to make sure it becomes the law of the land.  You can read the bill here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/372/text.

Prior to coming to Congress last year, I spent the past 16 years growing manufacturing companies in Ohio. I know firsthand how difficult it is to acquire capital to start, operate and grow small businesses.   Businesses that overcome these challenges are faced with numerous regulatory roadblocks that further hinder their growth. Many of those have come at the hands of regulatory frameworks like Dodd-Frank. But this bi-partisan measure that we are talking about today has the opportunity to help the challenges with capital acquisition that government has created and continue to create.    Currently, the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires any 'qualified venture fund' of over 100 to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The real burden of these regulations hits small companies in Middle America like Ohio’s 8th District, where unlike major cities, particularly on the coast, we do not have as many options for raising capital. Not every company seeks to become the next billion dollar blockbuster, but some of them do. All these companies offer great jobs and give many people the dignity of work, but they can also provide great returns.   This is why I am pleased to support H.R. 1219, the Supporting America’s Innovators Act of 2017, which simply increases the cap to allow up to 250 investors to be exempt from registration for 'qualified venture capital funds.' Allowing America’s small businesses the flexibility to operate and grow their companies, hire employees, and innovate.  Last year this Congress passed legislation similar to H.R. 1219 on a bipartisan vote of 388-9. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 1219 and perhaps increase its margin of victory.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanWarrenDavidson/videos/1363432223733189/",NA,46,2,4,2,0,0,0,0

The status quo has created a $20 trillion debt crisis.  This bill is a product of that same process: manage by crisis, jam in a last-minute package that overspends to ""buy"" support, then celebrate small wins - all while ignoring the debt.    The power of the purse is central to the role of Congress.  While there are notable wins in this bill, the process strips that Article I power to attach terms and conditions to the spending, spends more than the Budget Control Act budget caps, denies members of Congress the ability to amend the bill while stripping out previously approved amendments, discards amendments that passed in House-passed appropriations bills, and includes numerous federal bailouts.  The status quo diminishes the Constitutional role of Congress.  ""The people's House"" is supposed to represent the people.  This process strips members of that ability. The status quo is a path to bankruptcy.  It is not compassionate to bankrupt America.    ""On time and under budget"" has been a hallmark of Trump organizations in the past, and that needs to catch on in Congress.  Change is hard and the decisions are not easy, but a broken process that cannot continue must end. I am encouraged that President Trump has demonstrated the resolve to compel Congress to hit the next deadline (September 30, 2017), and I look forward to working with him and others to end the status quo in Washington.","link","http://thehill.com/policy/finance/331773-house-passes-spending-deal-to-avoid-shutdown","thehill.com",51,63,15,0,0,1,1,27

While this is a good first step, more work remains. This order fails to roll back some of the worst progressive mandates of the Obama era. Namely, protections are still needed for religious organizations involved with adoptions, military chaplains serving our troops, federal contractors seeking to preserve their religious identity, and schools maintaining their religious mission. Hillary Clinton punctuated this affront to our Constitution, when she suggested those opposed to her progressive views simply change their doctrine.   The executive order directs the attorney general to protect religious liberties. Attorney General Jeff Sessions most certainly will follow the law and the Constitution, but I worry about his successors. Thankfully, members of Congress have drafted bills and amendments ready to advance the cause of religious liberty for all Americans.  Now is the time for deeds, not words, if we are to preserve the freedoms our founders enshrined in the First Amendment.  I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues in Congress to build upon today’s executive order to ensure that religious liberty is protected for all Americans.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/04/trump-marks-national-day-prayer-signs-executive-order-on-religious-freedom.html","foxnews.com",104,47,16,14,0,0,1,41

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have been defending it!  The Wall Street Journal explained it: ""But last year he explained why that’s [reforming Dodd-Frank] not necessarily in Goldman’s interest. After describing how regulatory costs have helped raise the barriers to entry in his business “higher than at any other time in modern history,” Mr. Blankfein forecast more opportunities for global giants like Goldman to gain market share, as “only a handful of players” will likely be able “to effectively compete on a global basis.”    Even Barney Frank agrees that they missed the mark and benefited the biggest banks at the expense of smaller community banks! Dodd-Frank is a bad law and today the House will begin the process of ending its harmful impact on the American people.

The Make America Secure Appropriations Act will strengthen our military, provide critical resources to care for our veterans, and fully fund President Trump’s request for enhanced security on our southern border. Additionally, this bill will ensure a pay freeze for Members of Congress. Now, it is time for Congress to pass a fiscally responsible budget that makes needed changes to our out-of-control mandatory spending programs. We cannot bankrupt America.  The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act provides $2.1 billion (fully paid for) to extend the VA Choice Program, which was initially enacted in 2014, but is projected to run out of money in August. The program allows veterans who have difficulty accessing traditional VA facilities to get care elsewhere. While it is good to extend this program in a fiscally responsible manner, we must pursue fundamental reforms to the failing VA so our veterans can get the care they deserve.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanWarrenDavidson/photos/a.1085058544903893.1073741828.1064764650266616/1478676508875426/?type=3",NA,61,23,8,5,0,0,0,3

The bill recently passed out of our full committee comes up for a vote in the House in September, and makes progress toward privatization and actuarially sound prices.

The statement I made in that post led many people to falsely attribute all sorts of things not even mentioned, so here are my actual views on a viable solution.   Congress has failed to solve problems and change laws on a number of key issues, including this one. This is a complex issue, but the premise that these “dreamers” should be treated compassionately is easy; of course they should. However, past efforts to help them have broken down when there is a genuine effort to solve the root cause: illegal immigration. Many want to simply do the easier work of helping these children of illegal immigrants, but that will leave a next generation stuck in the same situation. Addressing DACA without correcting the root cause does not solve the problem.  For example, the 1986 amnesty program may have actually increased illegal immigration, enlarging the current population of “dreamers”.  The 1986 ""solution"" was not a solution, thus the present situation...  In my opinion, a comprehensive solution includes: 1) securing the border, 2) ending sanctuary cities, states and campuses, 3) ending birthright citizenship when neither parent is a U.S. citizen, 4) providing a path to citizenship for people (like these “dreamers”) who are personally innocent of breaking U.S. immigration law, 5) punishing criminal illegal aliens, and 6) massively simplifying the legal immigration process.  Immigrants should always be welcome in the USA, but immigration must be legal, secure, and integrate new citizens into America’s culture. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to help solve the problem comprehensively, and hope the Senate will prove helpful.   -Warren","status",NA,NA,403,184,69,53,0,2,2,23

One of the real risks to keeping our inheritance as Americans is getting the Legislative Branch to function properly. No more governing by cell phone and pen... This past week, the House of Representatives passed all appropriations bills, with amendments, on time - for the first time since 2009. To me this is a HUGE break from the status quo. You will be hard pressed to find it in the news, perhaps because it is largely good news. It is also incomplete. We need the Senate to take action. Like the House, they should accomplish the mission on time. #DeedsNotWords  Making this win possible took real leadership. Tom Graves (R-GA) pushed for a new approach. Speaker Ryan (R-WI) unleashed the committee to try something new and rallied the votes to get final passage. Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and the rest of the Appropriations Committee worked extended hours and took key votes. My Republican colleagues (including the overwhelming majority of the House Freedom Caucus and Republican Study Committee), having fought hard for bigger and bolder wins, overcame genuine concerns to make sure perfect did not become the enemy of a good final bill. Together we gained an important, though incremental, step toward regular order. Together, I feel the House GOP made real progress toward the teamwork necessary to govern well and accomplish the many wins needed to restore Article I of the Constitution to its preeminent role in preserving our republic. I hope we can sustain the momentum, but the swamp is still full of hazards ahead.

On the one hand, there is the pull to do whatever is popular - a flaw that has historically bankrupted pure democracies (free stuff is popular). On the other, there is the temptation toward authoritarianism (rule by a strong executive). Our founders sought to balance those tensions with our Constitution.  President Obama's actions combined both flaws. Congress and the courts attempted to check his unconstitutional abuse of power. President Trump's decision to suspend illegal payments to health insurance companies should be less about healthcare than about Constitutional government.

I appreciate the feedback on the posts we share on this Facebook page. One of the most discussed recently was my post sharing an image of the U.S. flag and the lyrics of My Country 'Tis of Thee. Many may not realize the powerful and unifying history of that song. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his powerful, ""I Have a Dream"" speech, the lyrics of My Country 'Tis of Thee provided a powerful crescendo as he ends the speech.  Despite the horrible and unjust way he was treated, Dr. King rejected the far left violence and angry rhetoric that would later characterize the Black Panthers. Instead, he gave one of the most powerful, and most persuasive speeches ever. His advisors reportedly told him to change his normal stump speech, and that is reflected in the first 10-11 minutes. Then, behind him, Mahalia Jackson cried out: ""Tell 'em about the dream, Martin.""  Dr. King set aside his remarks and closed in a way that has truly changed the world. I encourage you to listen to the speech. If pressed for time, about 11 minutes in he transitions to the close and at about 13:15 he references My Country 'Tis of Thee and famously concludes with ""Free at last!"".(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY)     I respectfully submit that our country offers a better opportunity for that dream than any other in all of time. We have the opportunity to do more, but that path lies in a united country, not a divided one. America respects our flag. May that never change. -Warren","link","https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/i-have-dream-address-delivered-march-washington-jobs-and-freedom","kinginstitute.stanford.edu",66,21,10,7,0,0,0,0

Old Glory  I am the flag of the United States of America. If you chose to be formal, you can call me The Star-Spangled Banner. I think someone wrote a song about me using that name. But really folks, I prefer my other nickname, Old Glory. I am proud to stand watch inside America's Halls of Justice. I boldly fly atop government buildings, be they Federal, State, and Local, all over the USA. I majestically stand guard over great institutions of learning, tall buildings, and thousands of other places including many citizen's homes in America.   I stand guard alongside the greatest military power in the world. Whenever you're in the presence of the military, look up and I'll be there too. I stand for peace, honor, truth, justice and, most importantly, FREEDOM! I am confident; I am sometimes arrogant; and, I am proud. When I am flown with my yellow banners, my head is always a little higher, my colors a little truer. I bow to no one. I am recognized all over the world.   I am worshipped by some. I am loved by many and am feared by your enemies. I have fought in every battle of every war since 1776. Dorchester Heights, Saratoga, Yorktown, Gettysburg, Shiloh, Antietam, San Juan Hill, the trenches of France, the Argonne Forest, Anzio, Rome, Normandy, Bastogne, Guam, Okinawa, Saipan, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and scores of other places long forgotten except for those who were there with me. When the armed forces took a stand for America, I was always there with them.   I flew over my Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines. I followed them and watched over them. They loved me. Upon that small hill in Iwo Jima, I was dirty, battle-worn and tired. But those Marines and Sailors cheered me on and made me proud to fly atop Mt. Suribachi. That was a view I shall never forget.   I was also proud to be soiled, burned, torn, and trampled on the streets of countries that America helped set free. What does hurt is when I am soiled, burned, torn, and trampled on the streets of my own country by those I have served with in battle or whom I have helped to keep free. Yes, that hurts. But I shall overcome because I am strong. I am enduring.   A few years back, I slipped the bonds of Earth and from my vantage point on the Moon, I stand watch over the unchartered new frontiers of space.   I have been silent witness to all of America's deeds, the worst and best alike, for more than 241 years. But my finest hours have occurred when I was torn into stripes to be used as bandages for my wounded comrades on the field of battle; when I fly at half-mast to honor my fallen Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and First Responders who sacrificed their lives for this nation, or when I lie in the trembling arms of a grieving family member at the gravesite of a fallen son or daughter.   Yes, my fellow countrymen, I am proud. My name is Old Glory. Long may I wave, dear God, long may I wave.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanWarrenDavidson/photos/a.1085058544903893.1073741828.1064764650266616/1572255629517513/?type=3",NA,42,6,13,7,0,0,0,0

Who must keep the republic? ""We, the people""  ""In a contract, two or more people come together to make an exchange. . . . And so you have the commercial contract that creates the market and the social contract that creates the state.  A covenant isn’t like that. It’s more like a marriage than an exchange. In a covenant, two or more parties each respecting the dignity and integrity of the other come together in a bond of loyalty and trust to do together what neither can do alone. A covenant isn’t about me. It’s about us. A covenant isn’t about interests. It’s about identity. A covenant isn’t about me, the voter, or me, the consumer, but about all of us together. Or in that lovely key phrase of American politics, it’s about “we, the people.”  The market is about the creation and distribution of wealth. The state is about the creation and distribution of power. But a covenant is about neither wealth nor power, but about the bonds of belonging and of collective responsibility. And to put it as simply as I can, the social contract creates a state but the social covenant creates a society.  Biblical Israel had a society long before it had a state, before it even crossed the Jordan and enter the land, which explains why Jews were able to keep their identity for 2,000 years in exile and dispersion because although they’d lost their state, they still had their society. Although they’d lost their contract, they still had their covenant. And there is only one nation known to me that had the same dual founding as biblical Israel, and that is the United States of America which had its social covenant in the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and its social contract in the Constitution in 1787. . . .  Listen to this sentence. See how odd it might sound to anyone but an American. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” Those truths are anything but self-evident. They would have been unintelligible to Plato, to Aristotle, or to every hierarchical society the world has ever known. They are self-evident only to people, to Jews and Christians, who have internalized the Hebrew Bible. And that is what made G. K. Chesterton call America “a nation with the soul of a church.""   America understands more clearly than any other Western nation that freedom requires not just a state, but also and even more importantly a society, a society built of strong covenantal institutions, of marriages, families, congregations, communities, charities, and voluntary associations. . . .  In America, the social contract is still there, but the social covenant is being lost. . . . "".","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanWarrenDavidson/photos/a.1122428434500237.1073741829.1064764650266616/1578988442177565/?type=3",NA,49,40,13,13,0,1,1,9

The reality is that when our Democrat friends initially structured the CFPB they did it with zero support from Republicans. They did it not to protect consumers and instead did it in a way that has a nice sounding name but is in fact very pernicious in its effect on the economy. I think Director Mick Mulvaney is a great choice for consumers in Ohio and across the country. I believe he will work to restore constitutional governance to the CFPB, which has been fraught with politicized conduct under its former Director Richard Cordray.","link","https://davidson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/npr-highlights-davidson-new-leadership-cfpb","davidson.house.gov",133,74,28,5,3,0,3,33
