Trump (presented in chronological order, from left to right, top to bottom).  First, the Capitol Building from my office window the night before.  Although the media would have you believe differently, many Democrats did attend the event.  In fact, I was sitting next to Democrat John Larson from Connecticut (with a beard) and fellow Republican Robert Aderholt from Alabama.  More Democrats at the event: President Carter and President and Secretary Clinton.  It was also good to see President George W. and Laura Bush.  And obviously, the outgoing Administration was present, beginning with Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, and followed by President Obama and Vice President Biden.   You could really feel the excitement of the crowd build as the inaugural procession began.  Here is Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, followed by Vice President Mike Pence.  And of course, the crowd erupted as President Trump appeared.    All in all, it was an exciting day in our nation's capital.  I thought President Trump delivered a unifying message in his address, pledging to fight for a nation and a federal government that works for all Americans.  He offered a vision of an America where everyone has an opportunity to share in its successes and no one is left behind.  I look forward to working with him and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve these bold, optimistic goals.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSteveChabot/photos/a.228701227155789.78759.204705339555378/1827840933908469/?type=3",NA,211,35,19,10,0,0,0,2

While there, I took this selfie in front of the Sir Christopher Wren Building on campus.  Built between 1695 and 1700, the Wren Building is the oldest American college building still in use.  The design of the building has been attributed to famed English mathematician and architect,  Sir Christopher Wren, hence its name.  Wren is best known for rebuilding much of London after the great fire in 1666.  The most renowned structure Wren rebuilt during that period was St. Paul's Cathedral, to which Wren added a dome which was, in turn, the inspiration for the dome of the U.S. Capitol Building.    I also snapped this photo of a statue in Williamsburg of Thomas Jefferson drafting the Declaration of Independence.  The connection?  Jefferson lived in the Wren Building while a student at William & Mary.  Jefferson attended William & Mary a few years before I did.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSteveChabot/photos/a.228701227155789.78759.204705339555378/1830666050292624/?type=3",NA,97,12,3,3,0,1,0,0

Here's a photo of Cincinnati's two state championship football teams -- St. Xavier High School in Division I and my alma mater Cincinnati La Salle High School in Division II.  What makes their championships so unique is that they not only share a league (the GCL South), but the two schools are located on the same road (North Bend Road), just down the street from each other.    The picture below shows each school's coach (Steve Specht at St. X, and Jim Hilvert at La Salle -- although Coach Hilvert recently accepted the head coaching position at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio), surrounded by a number of players.

Steve Chabot","2017-04-13","2017-04-13 13:54:48","Opening Day was last week and the Cincinnati Reds are on fire - let's hope they can keep the momentum.  So for #ThrowbackThursday, here's a photo from 30 years ago - 1987.  Here's the story behind it.  As all Cincinnatians know, the Reds were the first professional baseball team.  And in recognition of that, the Reds played the first game each year.  Well, the Toronto Blue Jays tried to muscle in on that tradition, and the city councils of Toronto and Cincinnati got into a verbal clash, and jointly decided that we'd settle the score with a friendly baseball game between the two city councils.  I was on Cincinnati City Council at the time, and we travelled to Toronto, played the game in Blue Jays Stadium before a real game, and got our butts kicked.  Anyway from left to right, back row: David Mann (whom I would defeat 7 years later to be elected to Congress), Mayor Charlie Luken, Ken Blackwell's son Rashad, Ken Blackwell, Jim Cissell, the late Pete Strauss, the late John Mirlisena (whom I would defeat for Hamilton County Commissioner 3 and again 5 years later), Guy Guckenberger, and front row left to right: Arn Bortz, me, and channel 12 reporter Steve Langford (his shirt says ""city newshound"").  GO REDS!  #TBT","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSteveChabot/photos/a.228701227155789.78759.204705339555378/1952346574791237/?type=3",NA,13,6,0,0,0,0,0,1

I was Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific at the time, and in that capacity, I led a congressional delegation trip to several Asian nations. Accompanying me on that CODEL was  Congressman Joe Kennedy III, grandson of JFK's brother, former Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

Kreuter grew up on Cincinnati's westside, and he graduated from St. Xavier High School and the University of Cincinnati.  He joined the U.S. Marine Reserves in 1998, and proudly served our nation until his tragic death in Iraq on August 3, 2005. On that fateful day, he was one of 14 marines killed when their transport vehicle hit a roadside bomb.  Sgt. Kreuter believed that hard work, preparation and a good education were the necessary components of a successful life, a belief reflected in his dedication to his duties. He was also a proud American, and cared deeply for the freedoms he fought every day to protect as a Marine. Our community and our nation lost a great man that day, and I am proud to stand with his family to honor his legacy.  Below is a picture with Sgt.

Our tax code needs to work for, not against, small businesses, and we need to continue pushing for real regulatory reform.
