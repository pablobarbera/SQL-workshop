Below is a message from Rep. Dave Reichert (WA-08), who served in law enforcement for 33 years, about the sacrifices officers make every day in the line of duty:  Last Friday, after a senseless act of violence, law enforcement officers at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida international airport acted without hesitation to secure the area and usher civilians to safety.  In 2016, we lost 135 members of law enforcement. That is a 10 percent increase over 2015. Even more alarming, there was a 56 percent increase in firearm‚Äìrelated officer fatalities last year and one-third of shooting deaths were ambush-style attacks‚Äî the highest total in more than two decades.  You may not know one of the 135 brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, friends, and colleagues we lost, but they are the reason our children feel safe on the playground, the reason your local hardware store owner can leave his shelves stocked knowing his merchandise will be there the next morning, and the reason the freedoms our country was founded on are more than ink on paper.  But this security comes at a cost.  Tacoma Police Officer Jake Gutierrez from my home state of Washington lost his life in the line of duty just last month while trying to protect a woman from a domestic abuser.  Gutierrez was supposed to exchange wedding vows with his fianc√© only a few weeks later. Instead, she and his three daughters and granddaughter attended his funeral and tried to picture a life without their husband, father, and grandfather.  This feeling of loss is one that I am all too familiar with.  In 1982, my partner and best friend, Sergeant Sam Hicks, was shot to death when attempting to arrest a homicide suspect. Sam left behind a wife who no longer has a husband and five children who no longer have a father. That was over 30 years ago, but loss is a pain time cannot erase.  I tell these stories not to dampen your spirits, but to remind you that those who work across the law enforcement community‚Äîthe police officers, sheriff‚Äôs deputies, corrections officers, FBI agents, border patrol agents, and all of our brave men and women‚Äîdo not have a job like the rest of us.  They have a calling. A calling that can result in grave danger and sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. But with the heart of a servant and love for their community, they respond to the call to serve anyway. They leave their homes everyday knowing they might not return.   At a time when we are seeing examples of unrest toward law enforcement, we must stop and think about just how much their daily acts of bravery impact our own lives.  I ask that on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, we do just that‚Äîshow appreciation for our law enforcement. A request that should not be reserved for a holiday, but should be honored each and every day.  So please join me in saying thank you‚Äîwhether that means displaying a blue light in your windowsill or shaking the hand of a local law enforcement officer.  A small gesture for those who are willing to give their life on our behalf.  #SupportBlue #TaketheLEAD2017 #ThankACop #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDonBacon/photos/a.1711069172539423.1073741826.1684399788539695/1712604182385922/?type=3",NA,21,1,3,0,0,0,0,0

In its history, the facility has held approximately 770 detainees, with the most at any one time around 680. The 41 held today include those who masterminded the 9/11 attacks that killed almost 3,000 Americans and the organizer of the attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 of our sailors.  There are other high-level detainees that led deadly attacks in other parts of the world as well.  It is beyond time to hold these murderers accountable.  Over the years, the executive and legislative branches have changed the laws and policies that guide the tribunal process, leading to where we are today.  It is time to move forward and deliver justice to the planners who killed thousands of our citizens.  We want accountability.  I commend the servicemen and women, as well as the civilians, who guard and care for these detainees in an admirable and professional manner.  This is a very demanding duty with high visibility and little room for lack of judgment.  I saw superb professionals dedicated to getting it done right.  I enjoyed having lunch with two soldiers from Nebraska, one from Bellevue and one from Fremont.  These two Reservists were proud of their mission.  The war against al Qaeda and ISIS continues, and most of the 41 detainees remain dedicated to the destruction of America.  Most want to be combatants again and about one-third of the Guantanamo Bay detainees who were previously released have rejoined the fight against us and our Allies. While this war continues, we must ensure none of the 41 are released and given the opportunity to again kill American citizens or our Allies.","link","http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/rep-don-bacon-says-u-s-needs-to-speed-up/article_aeacf570-7285-573e-aa7b-c0ca12614f3d.html","omaha.com",17,6,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is critical that the President establish a clear strategy and end-goal with regards to Syria and consult with Congress before taking further military action, as is required under the constitution.

The Program is designed to support locally-produced food, prepare job-ready agricultural graduates, and foster social and economic development for youth and adults.  Through this unique program, NCTA courses are offered for high school or college credits at the OHB‚Äôs main campus and their Cooper Memorial Farm. NCTA‚Äôs Omaha courses provide hands-on learning for individuals interested in obtaining skills for employment in the growing urban ag sector or starting their own urban ag enterprise. It not only provides instruction about produce, but poultry and livestock as well.  Programs like these will help keep agriculture strong and at the forefront of national treasures now and into the future.  I'm thankful for the opportunity to be there in support of the Urban Agriculture Program today.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDonBacon/photos/a.1711069172539423.1073741826.1684399788539695/1762698064043200/?type=3",NA,13,1,4,0,0,0,0,0

This month needs to be more than just awareness--it needs to be about action. Child welfare is an important issue in our society that is often overlooked.  With more than 420,000 youth currently in our nation‚Äôs foster care system, it is critical that we take time this month to raise awareness about the unique challenges young people in the system face.  Joined by my colleagues in the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus, I am committed to combining our unique and diverse experiences to bring a significant change to help youth prosper.  I look forward to celebrating foster youth, parents, and the professionals who are dedicated to ensuring that these young people succeed and eventually find a permanent loving and supportive home. Together, we can help make #FosterYouthVoices heard.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDonBacon/photos/a.1711069172539423.1073741826.1684399788539695/1773305912982415/?type=3",NA,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a letter from SecDef Mattis to Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, the Secretary outlines the negative impacts a Continuing Resolution (CR) has on our military. According to SecDef Mattis, readiness, weapons inventories, maintenance, modernization, and recruiting and retention, all suffer the consequences when a CR is passed. I respect the Secretary and agree with him.  The following are areas negatively impacted by a CR as outlined by Secretary Mattis:   -Readiness‚Äîtraining and exercises are cancelled or curtailed; this lost training time is unrecoverable -Weapons inventories- a CR slows ability to resupply critical munitions needed on the front line now -Maintenance‚Äîurgent repair work is suspended, delayed or cancelled. This results in longer deployment of worn-out/unsafe ships, aircraft, and vehicles -Modernization‚Äînew programs needed to keep pace with current threats are suspended indefinitely  -Recruiting & retention‚Äîa CR halts ability to fill vital military and civilian vacancies like pilots, linguists, engineers and doctors; risks permanent loss of critical skills","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/899b1f10-136a-4760-a058-b761137e9a23/mattis-letter-to-mccain-on-cr-9-8-17.pdf","mccain.senate.gov",26,8,1,0,0,0,0,1

Dr. Mitchell embodies what it means to serve your community. The power of the people does not rest in government, but in civic leaders such as Dr. Mitchell.   A direct descendant of Chief Big Elk, the last hereditary chief of the Omaha Nation, Dr. Mitchell has followed the legacy of his great-great-great-great grandfather by serving at the local, state, and national level.  He was the Tribal Chairman of the Omaha Nation and the Chief Elected Governmental Representative of his people.    With a high rate of depression among Native American youth, Dr. Mitchell has used his Bachelors of General Studies and Masters of Social Work to work with Native American youth, who have a high rate of depression. He also earned his Doctorate of Education in Counseling and Psychology, and taught Native American Studies at Creighton University.  He served our nation  in the US Army Medical Corps and is a lifetime member of the VFW Post 1581, and the American Legion Post #1, and although he has officially retired he still serves as an Elder to the Omaha Tribe.  In addition, Dr. Mitchell serves on the board of directors for the Big Elk Center, a non-profit that is working to provide a multitude of services to the more than 8,000 Native Americans from over 130 tribes that reside in the Omaha area.   There are so many other things I could mention about Dr. Mitchell, but what impressed me the most was his humble dedication to civic duty.   Thanks also to all of the guest speakers: Father Don Doll, S.J., Professor Emeritus, Creighton University; Mike Wolfe, Omaha Nation Chairman; Victoria Roche, Professor, School of Pharmacy and Health Professions, Creighton University; and Judi Gaiashkibos, Executive Director, NE Commission on Indian Affairs.
