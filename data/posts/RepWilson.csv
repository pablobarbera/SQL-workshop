Today CBC members held a protest to pledge the caucus's commitment to fight Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, leaving millions of Americans without access to affordable health care.  In Florida, the uninsured rate has dropped 38 percent since this life-saving law was enacted. More than one and a half million people gained coverage; 5 million-plus people saw an end to annual and lifetime limits; and nearly 8 million people with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage. Overall, the average amount saved per beneficiary was $987. In addition, since the Affordable Care Act closed the prescription donut hole, 355,360 seniors in our state are not having to make difficult choices about whether to buy food or medicine.   Those of us who fully support Obamacare are open to making improvements. But our Republican colleagues want to completely gut this much-needed protection, and making matters worse, have nothing in place to ensure that our constituents have access to affordable coverage, or in what will be too many cases, any coverage at all.  We stand united against any attempt to #MakeAmericaSickAgain.

I struggled for months to make the choice between the ceremony and a family wedding also scheduled to take place this weekend. I truly felt torn and it was a difficult decision, but I ultimately decided to stay in Miami to attend my god-daughter’s nuptials.   I will, however, witness the historic transfer of power from President Obama to President Trump in my district office with a group of young men who participated in the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. They feel for obvious reasons an emotional connection to Mr. Obama, but the next few years could profoundly impact their lives and it is important for them to be equally engaged.   Mr. Trump’s inauguration speech will provide an unparalleled opportunity for him to set the tone for his administration and share his vision for how he will be a “president for all Americans.” I am eager to hear what he has to say.  There are some issues on which we will inherently disagree, such as plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But more important, there are issues on which we can find common ground and work together for the good of the American people.   As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I look forward to working with this new administration on initiatives to end the school-to-prison pipeline and implement Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act and Title IV of the Every Student Succeeds Act, which provide communities and schools with the resources they need to help students stay invested and engaged in both their educations and their futures.","status",NA,NA,27,10,5,6,0,0,0,0

As boys, Barack Obama was the first American president of whom they were truly aware and for them the ultimate role model. Now we have a new commander-in-chief and while there are issues on which he and many of my constituents surely will disagree, it is important that everyone, and these and other young people in particular, be as engaged in the political process in Washington, D.C., and here at home, as they would be if their ideal candidate was the current occupant of the Oval Office. Perhaps even more so.  Last week, Georgia Congressman John Lewis came to Miami to deliver the keynote address at the Role Models’ annual Martin Luther King, Jr., scholarship breakfast, and he implored the audience to get involved and take stands on issues that matter to them, including policies and initiatives that are not in their best interests.  ""Never give up, never give in. Stand up, speak up. When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to do something, to say something and not be quiet,"" my dear colleague and college classmate said.""  And if you’re not engaged in what’s happening around you, you cannot fight what might hurt you.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1375595235824839/?type=3",NA,26,4,2,3,0,0,0,0

However, it is important to win the trust of our immigrant communities and foster strong ties between them and our law enforcement agencies to help keep our city safe. We also cannot forget the countless contributions of immigrants that have helped make our nation great.   It is unfortunate that cities, especially ones as diverse as ours, have been put in such a precarious situation. I hope that our law enforcement isn’t forced to engage in a crackdown on immigrants that will intimidate them and place undue pressure on families that are just trying to survive.   This debate underscores the importance of developing sound immigration policies, not punitive band-aids, that are both humane and comply with the law.   People come through Miami International Airport from all over the world. The ban on immigrants from seven predominately Muslim nations is shortsighted and was put in place too soon given that the secretary of state nominee has not yet been confirmed and the agency’s entire senior management team has resigned.  America must not become an isolationist country. We must strive to be as open and welcoming to immigrants as we always have been.","status",NA,NA,20,10,11,5,0,0,0,0

Wilson to Host Free HIV Testing Event to Observe National Black HIV Awareness Day  MIAMI – In observance of National HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (NBHAAD) Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson (FL-24) will partner with the Miami-Dade County Florida Department of Health to offer HIV testing on Tuesday, February 7, 2017, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., at Frederica Wilson and Juanita Mann Health Center, located at 2520 NW 75th Street, Miami, Florida.   “We have to end the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS so that we can end the spread and it starts with taking the test,” said Congresswoman Wilson.  “We cannot continue to ignore the problem and think that it will go away.  HIV/AIDS robs our communities of talent and productivity.  The best way to fight the spread of the disease is to get tested, know your status, and get the treatment you need if you are HIV positive.”  Held for the first time in 1999, National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (NBHAAD) is a national HIV testing and treatment community mobilization initiative targeted at Blacks in the United States and the Diaspora.  According to the CDC, 1 in 8 people living with HIV in the United States is unaware that they have the disease.  Miami-Dade and Broward counties were numbers 1 and 2 in the U.S. in new HIV infections in 2014 per 100,000 residents, according to state and federal data.    Congresswoman Wilson sponsored several bills to boost HIV/AIDS education and awareness throughout her career in public service.  This year marks the 15th anniversary of a bill she sponsored in the Florida legislature to mandate HIV testing for prisoners upon their release from Florida prisons.  The purpose of the bill was to confirm prisoners’ HIV status as they re-enter society and connect them to care if they were HIV positive.

Women are smart enough to make their own decisions and any effort to limit our choices through legislation is outrageous. This bill will be particularly harmful to some of the most underserved and vulnerable people in our country who will lose a broad range of family planning and preventive health services, such as cancer screenings, birth control, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and well-women exams.  The bill passed today is just the latest. In addition to working full steam to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no idea how to repair or replace it, my friends on the other side of the aisle in January passed H.R. 7, which places restrictions on how women with PRIVATE insurance can spend their PERSONAL dollars to purchase insurance.

Wilson Introduces the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act of 2017 On February 16, 2017, Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson introduced the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act of 2017. The legislation, which has 20 original co-sponsors, establishes a bipartisan commission to examine social disparities that disproportionally affect African-American men and boys that will be detailed in an annual report; offer solutions to address the its findings; and investigate potential civil rights violations that have gained national attention. Employment issues, racial profiling and education disparities would be top priorities because suspensions and expulsions often push young people onto a path to the criminal justice system.  “Our nation cannot afford to have a whole segment of society constantly struggling on the sidelines,” said Congresswoman Wilson. “Such a commission also would send an important message to America that the lives of black men and boys matter and the issues that so negatively impact them are a national priority.”  According to the Educational Testing Services Policy Information Center, more than 50 percent of black male students at urban-area schools will not graduate. As a result, black men are six times more likely to be incarcerated and receive harsher sentences for the same crimes than their white counterparts. Although the black male population comprises approximately six percent of the United States population, they make up nearly half of the 2.3 million people incarcerated nationwide.    “These statistics are unacceptable,” the Florida lawmaker added. “Addressing disparities plaguing African-American males will positively impact our entire nation. The commission’s work can help increase the number of contributing members of society, bring more people out of poverty and into the workforce, and produce positive role models to inspire future generations.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1402471919803837/?type=3",NA,26,2,7,4,0,0,0,0

The repercussions of mass deportations will split families apart and make undocumented immigrants vulnerable to various types of abuses, including racial profiling and human trafficking. When both legal and undocumented immigrants see something nefarious taking place, they won’t say anything for fear of being rounded up or putting a loved one in jeopardy. The trust we’ve worked so hard to build between immigrants and law enforcement will quickly erode.  “While it is true that some undocumented immigrants deserve deportation, the majority are law abiding people who contribute to the nation’s economy through their hard work. Instead of spending millions to deport them, wouldn’t the money be better spent on helping them live in the U.S. legally? Mass deportation is no substitute for comprehensive immigration reform.”","status",NA,NA,10,2,3,0,0,0,1,0

It was good to hear him call for accessible and affordable child care and paid family leave for new parents. Infrastructure spending to repair our nation’s crumbling roads, bridges, tunnels, and transportation systems—and create jobs—is also an important priority for both parties. But as the old saying goes, action speaks louder than words, and I pray that President Trump’s words on these critical issues were not just rhetoric and will instead be promises fulfilled.  “That will in large part depend on House Speaker Paul Ryan, who like his predecessor must deal with a divided GOP caucus, and also negotiate with a cabinet egregiously made up of people whose views are seemingly in direct contrast with the missions of the agencies they’ve been tasked to lead.

Wilson Celebrates Women’s History Month  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson joined millions of Americans in marking the annual celebration of March as Women’s History Month – a commemoration that has occurred in America since 1987.  “During Women’s History Month, we honor the courageous women in our history who have marched, organized, and advanced the promise of equality, including such giants as Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who led the fight for women to get the right to vote,” Rep. Wilson said.   This year marks the 100th anniversary of women serving in Congress.   On April 2 we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Jeannette Rankin, the first woman member of Congress and a suffragette, being sworn into office.  She was sworn into office three years before women nationwide were guaranteed the right to vote.      In 1970, there were still only 11 women in Congress – 10 in the House and 1 in the Senate.  However, as progress for women has accelerated in recent years, the increase in the number of women in Congress has been dramatic.  Now, in the 115th Congress, there is a record number of women serving in Congress, with a total of 109 women in Congress, including delegates – 88 in the House and 21 in the Senate.   “As we celebrate the many victories that women have won, we must keep fighting to make more progress,” Rep. Wilson pointed out.  “There are many steps that need to be taken to expand the economic opportunities available to America’s women.  In recent years, Congressional Democrats have been fighting to enact such critical legislation as ensuring equal pay for equal work, expanding the availability of affordable child care, a paid sick leave initiative, and a paid family leave initiative, but unfortunately, Congressional Republicans have blocked these landmark proposals at every turn.  We will keep fighting this year.”    “As we celebrate Women’s History Month, let us continue to work to make an America for our daughters and our granddaughters where they will truly have the equal rights, the equal opportunities, and the equal treatment, that they so need and deserve,” the Florida lawmaker concluded.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1414181188632910/?type=3",NA,9,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

Earlier this week, in his first address before a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump urged lawmakers to pass legislation to fund school choice programs. Today he and his education secretary traveled to my home state to tour Orlando’s St. Andrew Catholic School and hail it as an example of how voucher programs can benefit disadvantaged and minority children.  “What both the president and Secretary DeVos failed to acknowledge is that programs like the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship do not cover the full cost of tuition and other expenses that are required when one sends a child to private school, such as books and supplies, transportation, and extracurricular activities.  “More important, vouchers drain public school systems of badly needed funding. Some of the so-called private schools that accept vouchers lack accountability and have not demonstrated the kinds of academic gains that justify siphoning taxpayer dollars out of the public school system, leaving our most disadvantaged students even further behind in underfunded schools with even fewer resources.  “Since 90 percent of American students attend public schools, children in disadvantaged communities would benefit so much more if President Trump and Secretary Devos would focus on how to provide them with high-quality schools that are equitable to those attended by children in middle- and upper-income communities. I am hopeful, however, that Secretary DeVos and the president will be willing to work with Democrats on ways in which we can strengthen our nation’s public school system, instead of focusing exclusively on superficial alternatives like school choice programs.”","status",NA,NA,8,1,8,1,0,0,1,1

Wilson hosted the Pastors and Principals Fighting Crime through Spirituality Summit on Friday, March 3, 2017, at Jungle Island.  More than 500 people, including 100 pastors, were treated to an inspirational message from national civil rights and social justice activist, Reverend Al Sharpton, and House Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-SC).  Miami-Dade Police Department director Juan Perez, state attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle, and Pastor Carl Johnson, spiritual leader for the Miami Dade “My Brother’s Keeper” Initiative, and other community and faith leaders also addressed the audience onways in which they could work together to improve the lives of children.  Community activists, including members of Mothers of Murdered Children, principals, and students from schools that are most affected by gun violence, crime, and where children have been murdered, also attended the event.    “We have to reign in the senseless violence that is gripping our communities,” said Congresswoman Wilson. “I am grateful that Congressman Clyburn and Reverend Sharpton joined us today. Each issued powerful charges to our faith leaders as we transform places of worship into safe havens for our youth.”  The Pastors and Principals Fighting Crime through Spirituality Summit was the first step toward pairing schools with places of faith to ensure that students have safety nets  to keep them safe from danger, and deter them from committing crimes.  In addition to being inducted as mentors in the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project, faith leaders pledged to complete several initiatives.  Among the commitments were identifying male congregants to serve as mentors to boys, transforming church parking lots into basketball courts for students, establishing a weekly prayer conference call to prepare students for the upcoming school week, and developing character education curriculum for Sunday schools or youth ministries.    Faith leaders will also reach out to parents of children who live within a one mile radius of their places of worship to engage them in the necessity of spirituality as a component to eliminate crime in our communities.  The leaders also pledged to host an annual 5000 Role Models Youth and Mentors’ Day at their places of worship on June 4, 2017.  “Addressing gun violence is not a new commitment of Congresswoman Wilson or many of the faith leaders who are present today,” said Reverend Sharpton during his keynote address.  “But, there is no quick fix.  We’re burying too many of our children.  So, we have to work together collectively, strongly, and more diligently with the forces here today until we can bring a level of self-expectation to these young people.”   The summit concluded with remarks from keynote speaker Congressman  Clyburn, who recognized the faith leaders’ role in developing boys into wholesome men who will make great contributions to our communities.    “We must still find a cure for cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and other infirmities,” said Congressman Clyburn.  “I sincerely believe that each of these young people, if given the right experiences, could very well grow to be the person who makes these great discoveries.”  “These are babies and their futures are being stolen by gun violence,” added Congresswoman Wilson.  “It is going to take a village to keep our children safe.  Our faith leaders have accepted the charge to engage in this new initiative which will use spirituality as a method to reduce crime in our communities.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1418809021503460/?type=3",NA,14,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wilson Responds to the Congressional Budget Office’s Report on the Republicans’ Health Care Bill  Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson issued the following statement on the Congressional Budget Office’s report on how the Republicans’ legislation will impact Americans’ access to affordable health care:  “Today the Congressional Budget Office released a report on the Republicans’ health care bill that reinforced what we’ve known all along: Millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage while the nation’s millionaires and billionaires simultaneously get a tax break.  “According to the CBO report, 24 million Americans will ultimately become uninsured under the GOP’s American Health Care Act, including 14 million next year alone. In addition, 19 percent of the nonelderly population will be uninsured in 2026, compared to 10 percent under the Affordable Care Act.   “If the GOP’s reverse Robin Hood-themed legislation becomes law, a 64-year-old earning $26,500 per year will have to spend more than half of his or her income ($12,900) to pay for premiums in the individual market. All the while, the nation’s wealthiest and large corporations will enjoy $600 billion in tax cuts. The Republicans’ proposal also defunds Planned Parenthood in the first year, which would deprive many women of access to annual exams and contraception and family planning services and slashes Medicaid by $880 billion over the next ten years. Many people who do manage to purchase an insurance plan will find themselves paying far more for way less.  “To describe the GOP’s American Health Care Act as merciless and inhumane would be the epitome of understatement. Republicans continue to insist that all Americans will have access to care, but don’t believe the hype. Access does not guarantee affordability and the GOP plan is a prescription for disaster.”","status",NA,NA,12,1,3,1,0,0,0,0

Wilson will cloak former 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project student Joseph Dubery at the Howard University College of Medicine’s Annual Long White Coat Ceremony on Friday, March 17, 2017.    The ceremony marks an honored pre-graduation tradition as students move from a short coat to a long coat in their final year of medical school – a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats. Students also will take the Hippocratic Oath and pledge their service to their patients and future communities.  “I am so proud to have witnessed Joseph’s journey from a middle school student to doctor and am honored to cloak him as he embarks on his successful medical career,” said Congresswoman Wilson. “The 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project is a program committed to guiding minority boys along a carefully chartered path to manhood and sending them to college. Joseph’s road to success demonstrates that the program works.”  Dubery joined the 5000 Role Models as a sixth grader at Parkway Middle School, in Miami Gardens.  In 2005, he graduated from Miami Northwestern Senior High with aspirations of becoming a medical doctor. He received a four-year scholarship from the 5000 Role Models, which enabled him to earn a bachelor of arts degree in psychology with minors in English and chemistry from the University of Miami in 2010. In 2012, Dubery earned a master’s degree in biomedical sciences from Barry University.    “My dream of becoming a medical doctor began many years ago as the child of immigrant parents from Antigua who came to America for opportunity,” said Dubery. “My mother worked hard to ensure her three sons attended college, but there were some challenges.  The 5000 Role Models of Excellence Program, founded by Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, filled the gaps. I thank Congresswoman Wilson and the Role Model mentors for being a source that I could always depend on.”  “Though the program has produced many lawyers, Joseph is just our third doctor,” said Congresswoman Wilson.  “Our nation will face a doctor shortage by the year 2030, so I hope that he is the third in a long line of physicians.”","status",NA,NA,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Joseph has never wanted to be anything but a medical doctor. It is a goal that has eluded too many young people who are full of potential but whose dreams are often dashed by the circumstances of their upbringing. Joseph was raised in a single parent household with little-to-no money to spare. That did not, however, stop his mother, a proud native of the island nation Antigua, from instilling in her three sons the importance of education and working hard to ensure going to a college was an option for each of her sons.  Joseph’s ambitions were reinforced by his participation in the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project, an in-school mentoring and dropout prevention initiative that I proudly founded nearly 25 years ago. Joseph joined the program as a sixth-grader at Parkway Middle School. He credits it with introducing him to strong, caring, successful men who look like him and taught him how to make smart choices in and out of school.   These lessons served him well when as a student at Miami Northwestern Senior High School he participated in medical immersion programs during the school year and at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine in the summer. That dedication enabled him to earn scholarships from the Role Models program and a host of other organizations, including Salute to Education, Inc., the Omega Psi Phi and Kappa Alpha Psi fraternities, and the Horatio Alger Association.   I am proud to note that during his pursuit of higher education these past 12 years, earning a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Miami, with minors in English and chemistry; a master’s degree in biomedical sciences degree from Barry University, and soon a medical degree from Howard, Joseph has paid everything he has been given forward by mentoring boys of color in my congressional district because, Role Model boys become role models for life.   He has won numerous awards at Howard University for service to his class and the surrounding community, including the Golden Humanism Award, one of the highest tributes a medical student can receive for empathetic patient care and interactions with colleagues. He also mentors minorities interested in attending medical school and hopes to one day create a pipeline that will expose inner-city students to the field of medicine.  Joseph is an exemplar of what a person who is committed to a goal can achieve, but his journey has not always been easy. As an undergraduate he had to work to help his family financially and also be a source of strength and support for his brothers. These responsibilities impacted his academic performance and necessitated him taking five years to earn his degree. But in the spirit of the old saying that “what doesn’t kill you can make you stronger,” Joseph went to graduate school to enhance his competitiveness for the medical school admissions process. He was undeterred after failing a medical licensing exam, which again meant an additional year, and considers such setbacks blessings in disguise.  In April, Joseph will serve as an American Academy of Emergency Medicine Resident and Student Association intern in the office of Congressman Raul Ruiz, where he will learn about and help influence health care policy. Upon graduation, he hopes to focus in emergency or family medicine.  I applaud the dedication and commitment that has enabled Joseph Dubery to pursue and achieve what many might have considered an impossible dream. May the world be filled with more like him.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1431641666886862/?type=3",NA,16,2,0,1,0,0,0,0

Wilson issued the following statement on House Republicans’ efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act:  “It is no coincidence that on the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans hoped to hold a vote to repeal and replace it. Hope is the operative word here because after seven years of promising to repeal and replace Obamacare, the GOP failed to whip together a bill that could win the 215 yeas from its own caucus that are needed to pass it and was forced to postpone the vote.   “This is not surprising when symbolism is prioritized over substance. In addition to making minute-by-minute changes to an already hastily prepared bill, House leadership has not had it scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, so the proposed legislation’s monetary cost is as big a mystery as its contents.   The price that the 24 million Americans who stand to lose their coverage would pay if the American Health Care Act becomes law, however, is indisputable. Premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs will rise. Americans aged 50-64 will pay premiums that are five times higher than what others will pay even if they are in good health.    “Planned Parenthood will be defunded, which will lead to an increase in unintended pregnancies and the transmission of STDs. Low-income women will be particularly harmed by this because they will lose access to critical services like breast exams, cancer screenings and birth control. The legislation also gives nearly $900 billion in tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, paid for in part by $175 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund. This is not only inexcusable, but also manifestly wrong.  “Under the American Health Care Act, 277,600 individuals in District 24 whose health insurance covers preventive services like potentially life-saving cancer screenings and flu shots without co-pays or deductibles could lose that access. Nearly 300,000 people who have employer-sponsored insurance plans are at risk of losing key consumer protections like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits that have in the past financially ruined so many individuals and families. In addition, the 91,500 district residents who in 2016 received financial assistance to purchase plans through the health insurance exchange could see their coverage become unaffordable.   “As even former President Barack Obama and many Democratic lawmakers will concede, the Affordable Care Act is imperfect, but we are willing to work with our colleagues across the aisle to improve it so that even more Americans will have access to quality insurance plans that they can actually afford.  I was not yet a member of Congress during the fight to pass the Affordable Care Act, but I am more than ready for the battle to strengthen and preserve it.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1438483686202660/?type=3",NA,20,6,3,0,0,0,0,0

Wilson issued the following statement on House Republicans’ second failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act:  ""Today the American Health Care Act was for a second time pulled from consideration on the House floor. While the Republican lawmakers who did not support it and I opposed the legislation for very different reasons, I am pleased that at least for now the Affordable Care Act has not been repealed or replaced. Seconds after I expressed my opposition, we learned that President Donald Trump had instructed Speaker Paul Ryan to pull the bill from consideration.  ""As I noted in a statement yesterday, the Republican proposal would be harmful to the American public’s health: Premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs would rise. Older Americans would be forced to pay premiums that are five times higher than what others pay even if they are in good health.  The health of untold numbers of women would be adversely affected by the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Hundreds of thousands of people in my district would lose access to affordable insurance plans and potentially life-saving services.   ""Although we did not vote today, the battle to save the Affordable Care Act from extinction is far from over. And while both sides regroup to figure out the next steps, I implore my Republican colleagues to remember the message I delivered today on the House floor: Illness doesn’t discriminate and their constituents get sick, too. We are fortunate to not only have excellent insurance coverage but also access to medical care in the Capitol, if needed. By working together, we can create a plan that works for all Americans--not just members of Congress. I sincerely hope that’s exactly what we will do.""  https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4663449/fsw-remarks","link","https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4663449%2Ffsw-remarks","c-span.org",20,8,8,0,0,1,0,0

Today I attended an important and informative hearing on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Brownfields Program, hosted by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Titled “Building a 21st Century Infrastructure for America: Revitalizing American Communities Through the Brownfield Program,” the hearing featured testimony from various experts and stakeholders about how remediating brownfields helps to foster jobs and keep our communities healthy.   A brownfield is described as “a former industrial or commercial site where future use is affected by real or perceived environmental contamination.” Unfortunately, there is at least one in every single congressional district in the United States. According to the most recent statistics, Miami-Dade and Broward counties have 63 and 25 brownfield sites, respectively. Those numbers might sound scary, but that’s why the EPA’s Brownsfield Program is so important. Once upon a time our District 24 was home to a rail yard that was contaminated by lead, arsenic, and petroleum. Thanks to the EPA program, it was transformed into Midtown Miami, a $1.2 billion mixed-use development that supports nearly 2000 jobs.  Please click here to hear my statement and the witnesses’ responses about how cleaning up brownfields has made a difference in their communities.   http://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=qY7c0sjLDUY","link","https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=qY7c0sjLDUY","youtube.com",7,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Sadly, however, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have taken a major step backward with the passage of a law to block the FCC’s broadband privacy and data security rules.    Broadband providers have access to a plethora of highly personal and potentially sensitive information about users based on their browsing history and social media posts. With the passage of this measure, they will be free to sell that information to the highest bidder without consumers’ consent, opening the door to possible abuses. Internet service providers will, for example, be able to sell personal medical data to potential employers who in response may decline to make a job offer to a candidate with a preexisting medical condition.  It is ironic that this legislation may soon become law during a period when the United States is embroiled in the Russian hacking crisis. In addition, in recent years major corporations, such as Target and Yahoo, have been the victims of hackers, affecting more than a billion user accounts.  Technology has made our lives so much easier to navigate. Using it to invade Americans’ privacy is both unconscionable and uncalled for. S.J. Res. 34 will soon head to President Trump’s desk for his signature. We must all urge him to veto this bill because it is bad for American citizens.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1450502731667422/?type=3",NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Wilson’s Statement on Equal Pay Day  Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson today marked Equal Pay Day and cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which aims to strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and guarantee that women can challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable.   “Despite its name, Equal Pay Day calls attention to the fact that women in the United States who work fulltime earn on average only 80 cents for each dollar earned by a man. This economic injustice is even worse for African-American and Hispanic women, who earn 63 cents and 54 cents, respectively, for every dollar earned by white men. Based on the current wage gap, today a 20-year-old woman just starting to work fulltime stands to lose a total of $418,800 during a 40-year career compared to her male counterpart.   “The statistics in Florida are slightly better, with white, black, and Hispanic women’s respective median earnings at 84 percent, 70 percent, and 68 percent of that earned by white men, but nonetheless still both unfair and unjust. It creates an additional burden for women who work and make their home in cities like Miami, where housing costs are among the most expensive in the nation. Moreover, this wage gap hurts not only women who deserve to be equal wages for equal work, but also their families who are increasingly required to do more with fewer resources.  “If fairly paid, on average a working woman in Florida would earn enough money for fifteen more months of child care, 1.2 additional years of tuition for a four-year public university or the full cost of tuition for a two-year community college, 78 more weeks of food for her family, seven more months of mortgage and utilities payments, and eleven more months of rent.   “I have supported the Paycheck Fairness Act since my first year in Congress and firmly believe that closing the wage gap will benefit our entire society. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), who is the legislation’s House sponsor, has introduced this bill in Congress every year since 1997. I hope that 2017 will be the year in which we finally do the right thing.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1451926598191702/?type=3",NA,6,3,3,0,0,0,0,0

The images of their excruciating pain will be forever seared in our minds and as the leader of the free world the United States cannot ignore such an atrocity.   “It was, however, just a first step toward addressing the civil war in Syria and the Assad regime, so President Trump will need to follow up the airstrikes with a cohesive plan of action that clearly defines strategies and goals for both Syria and the region. Moreover, before the president makes any more aggressive moves against Syria, he will need congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution.  “District 24 is war weary and America is war weary. There has to be a way to remove Assad, a brutal dictator, without military intervention by the United States of America. We have to work with our allies in the region and our foes in the region who I am sure are aware of what an all-out war would mean to the world given the easy access to chemical weapons by unstable countries in that region of the world.   “I await a comprehensive strategy from President Trump that Congress can review and ascertain the risks to America and the world, and then respond to the White House accordingly.”","status",NA,NA,4,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

Wilson to Attend Transportation and Infrastructure Hearing on Airline Customer Service   Washington, D.C. – In response to the violent removal of Dr. David Dao from United Express flight 3411 and the altercation on American Airlines flight 591, during which a flight attendant nearly struck a mother and her baby with a stroller he forcibly took from her, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will hold a full committee hearing on Tuesday, May 2, 2017, to examine U.S. airlines’ customer service policies and issues.  “These incidents should alarm us and serve as clarion calls for reform. They should compel Congress and industry to take bold and decisive actions to ensure that consumers are not mistreated,” said Florida Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson.   Long before these and other widely publicized incidents, American consumers were feeling like they were paying more for less. As the level of service has declined, airlines have enjoyed record profits, including a whopping $3.8 billion in 2015 for checked baggage alone. Recent headlines on the physical mistreatment of passengers by airline employees have spurred Capitol Hill lawmakers into action, but the hearing also will explore ways to improve consumers’ overall flying experience.  “In my home state, tourism is a leading industry that supports millions of jobs and more than 50 percent of Florida’s visitors arrive by plane. When the friendly skies are no longer friendly, we must act. Inaction could be costly to both the nation’s economy and humanity,” Rep. Wilson added. “As a new member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to help formulate sensible reforms to strengthen protections for the flying public.”   https://transportation.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=401344","link","https://transportation.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=401344","transportation.house.gov",2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

One of the great strengths of the Florida delegation is the ability of all of its members to put partisan differences aside and work closely together on issues of mutual interest and concern. Ileana and I have traveled to Haiti several times together to assess what was happening on the ground after devastating natural disasters and returned home to advocate on Haiti’s behalf. She also managed my Bring Back Our Girls bill on the House floor in December, which no other Republican from the Foreign Affairs Committee was willing to do. It was a critical step in getting the legislation passed and signed into law.   “Ileana was the first Latina woman to be elected to Congress.

Wilson issued the following statement in response to the passage of the American Health Care Act:  “After the stunning defeat in April of their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans today achieved their long-awaited goal. They were only able to do so by making back-room deals to coerce reluctant members of their caucus into voting for legislation that will do more harm than good. The American Health Care Act takes health care away from the poor and gives tax breaks to the rich, which is both immoral and irresponsible. Moreover, the legislation has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, so we have no idea what the economic cost of this travesty will be.  “But we do know the human costs of this bad bill.  “The American Health Care Act is not only immoral and irresponsible, it is downright un-American. It gives states waivers from the requirement to sell plans that cover essential services, including preventive care, prescription drug coverage, and mental health and addiction treatment. It discriminates against older Americans who could be charged five times more than other consumers. It puts people with pre-existing conditions at risk and may force them to accept inferior coverage and pay catastrophic fees.  The legislation also cuts Medicare and Medicaid by more than $1 trillion.  “After the vote, Republican lawmakers headed to the White House to celebrate their dubious victory with President Trump. When they return to their districts, however, they may find their constituents aren’t cheering along.   “As those voters have made clear in town hall after town hall, they virulently oppose TrumpCare because it replaces their health care with something that costs more for less and in the worst cases will put affordable care out of reach. And, like me, they believe it is egregiously unfair for members of Congress to have the best health insurance available while diminishing or eliminating access to affordable plans that millions of Americans have come to depend on.  “The good news is that this bill will likely have an even more difficult time getting through the Senate. So when it’s time to go back to the drawing board, I hope my Republican colleagues will work with Democrats to craft legislation that is fair and will help even more Americans secure health care coverage. And during that process I hope they will remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1489002941150734/?type=3",NA,10,2,4,1,0,0,0,1

This cowardly act of hanging bananas from nooses across the American University campus, with the messages “AKA Free” and “Harambe Bait,” is not only despicable, but is also a hate crime for which the person or people responsible should be appropriately charged.  I strongly urge the university to take every step necessary to uncover those responsible for this crime and ensure that they get a well-deserved day in court.   It is a travesty that in this day and age, such bigotry still exists.   No matter how high we go—whether it’s being elected the nation’s first black president or AU’s first African-American student government president—some people just can’t help themselves from going low.  Unfortunately, this is not even the first time in the past year that such a controversy has occurred on AU’s campus.   Without the appropriate action, it will not be the last.   Sadder still, American University is not the only campus on which white students are expressing their prejudices against students of color.    I stand here today with my sorors to let the world know that we will not stand silent in the face of racism.   This not the last you will hear from us about the American University incident and those that have occurred and will likely occur again on campuses across the nation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1489039184480443/?type=3",NA,11,3,1,2,2,0,0,0

Wilson issued the following statement on the release of dozens of Chibok Girls:  “I was elated to learn this evening that dozens of Chibok girls have been released three years and three weeks after being abducted by the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram. My joy is bittersweet, however, because once the names of those freed have been announced, many families will experience a crushing disappointment that will be compounded by the uncertainty of whether their girls are even still alive.  “Since this nightmare began on April 14, 2014, 57 of the 276 girls that Boko Haram kidnapped escaped that night. In May 2016, another was found wandering in a forest in May 2016, and last October, 21 Chibok schoolgirls were released as a result of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, with the aid of the government of Switzerland.  “As the details of this most recent release continue to unfold, we must remain diligent in the fight for the release of the young women still being held by Boko Haram. It is important that Nigerian government officials know that the world is both watching and waiting for their return and I am confident that such pressure helps keep them vigilant.  “On December 14, 2016, legislation that Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and I sponsored to combat Boko Haram and address the impact of its insurgency became Public Law 114-266. It directs the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense to jointly develop a five-year strategy to aid the Nigerian government, members of the Multinational Joint Task Force created to combat Boko Haram, and international partners who’ve offered their support to counter the regional threat posed by Boko Haram. The strategy also must address the severe famine, humanitarian and education crises created by Boko Haram.    “The five-year strategy is due on June 12, 2017. It also is the deadline for the director of National Intelligence to assess the willingness and capability of Nigeria and its regional partners to implement the strategies outlined. It is critical that they don’t miss this urgent deadline.  “Today’s news once again underscores why we have to keep pushing and pressing and doing everything we can to ensure that the Chibok schoolgirls are not forgotten—and why we must never stop believing that we will bring back our girls.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1491111384273223/?type=3",NA,10,6,4,2,0,0,0,0

While we were serving on the CBC Alliance, Judge Robinson pointed out to me that there was no day to recognize the important work of our child welfare professionals.  We worked together to develop Senate Bill 78 in 2008.    “The bill was passed in the house and senate, and was signed into law by then-Governor Charlie Crist.  The spirit of the bill was to ensure that the professionals who are entrusted with the well-being of our children get the appreciation they rightfully deserve.  We have been marking this day since 2008 and we want to alert everyone in Florida that this is a state law.  This is a state holiday.  So, the second Monday of every May I want everyone in Florida to thank a child welfare professional.  They are our unsung heroes who work tirelessly to ensure the safety and well-being of our most precious resource – our children.    “Each year the Marlins Foundation recognizes child welfare professionals by inviting them to see a Marlins game free of charge.  This year the Marlins will pause during that game to recognize child welfare professionals.  The day was celebrated across the state this year with recognition from Governor Rick Scott and resolutions passed by Hernando, Liberty and Miami-Dade counties commemorating the day.  I urge each county in the great state of Florida to participate next year as we continue to highlight the efforts of child welfare professionals to remind them of how vitally important they are to our community.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1492905197427175/?type=3",NA,6,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

I believe that the president is desperate for attention and needs psychological help.   “As president, Trump has the right to declassify anything he wants, but that doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do. Russia is not our friend and the sooner he realizes that, the better off our country will be.  “President Trump prides himself on having won office without having served one day in public service.   “He would be well-advised to set aside his Twitter account and focus on learning both how our government works and how to govern before something catastrophic happens as a result of his careless and cavalier approach to being president.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1500255826692112/?type=3",NA,19,8,3,2,2,0,0,0

Haiti is struggling mightily to rebuild following major natural disasters, including an earthquake and hurricanes, and is no position to accept and aid deportees. It also is dealing with health-related crises, from cholera to Zika.  “As the congressional representative of a large Haitian community, I have witnessed first-hand how Haitians living in Miami help ease that burden by regularly sending money, clothing and other supplies back home to their families and friends, as do Haitians living in other cities around the nation. In some cases, these kindnesses are the recipients’ sole means of survival.   “Haitians also enrich American life in many ways, and it is an honor to acknowledge their achievements.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1502159553168406/?type=3",NA,8,5,2,1,1,0,0,0

Much of what we heard was not new news, but it was nonetheless disturbing to hear Mr. Comey describe the uncomfortable position in which President Trump repeatedly put him, in an inappropriate and likely unethical effort to shut down the FBI’s probes and pressure the director into clearing his name. Indeed, the fact that the president was not at the time under investigation seems to be the White House’s number one concern and the most important takeaway from today.  “What Comey described is Impeachment of Justice 101. If all of what I heard is true and corroborated by his former colleagues and the investigation, I believe there is no question that President Trump will be impeached.   “As Mr. Comey described in rich detail his interactions with Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan came to the president’s defense, using his status as a political neophyte as an excuse for his actions and treatment of the former FBI director.  While it is true that this is Mr. Trump’s first time in elective office, ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for not understanding the rule of law or how our government works. This is the real world, not ‘The Apprentice’ and the stakes are too high for a prolonged on-the-job training period.   “Instead of surrounding himself with yes men and women, President Trump would serve both himself and his legacy well if he cultivated a first-rate group of advisors who can offer him sound counsel that he will listen to and respect.”","status",NA,NA,26,9,6,3,1,0,0,0

Wilson (FL-24) issued the following statement as Hurricane Irma moves across the Caribbean:  “Hurricane Irma could become a major and life-threatening storm.  Destructive winds, storm surge, dangerous surf, heavy rainfall and flash flooding are all possible,” said Congresswoman Wilson. “Though the location of Hurricane Irma’s landfall is unpredictable, history has shown that storm tracks can change quickly and unexpectedly, which means the hurricane could potentially impact Florida.”  “It is critical that you use the next few days to get prepared and stay informed.  Make sure you and your loved ones have a disaster preparedness plan and all necessary supplies.”  Floridians can take the following steps recommended by FEMA to prepare for Hurricane Irma:  • Update your disaster kit. Have a three-day supply of non-perishable food, bottled water, a battery-operated radio, flashlight, extra batteries, cash, medicines, first aid kit, pet foods, and important family documents. • Know your evacuation routes and prepare options for overnight lodging. Storm surge can cut off evacuation routes, so do not delay leaving if an evacuation is ordered for your area.  Follow the direction of state, local, and tribal officials. • Develop an emergency communication plan. It should include a phone number and email address for a family member or friend outside the area who can serve as a point of contact in the event of separation. • Stay Informed. Keep up-to-date on the latest weather information. Watch local news and weather, listen for radio updates or stay informed with your computer or smartphone.  It also is imperative to have an adequate supply of food and water during a disaster.  • Keep an appliance thermometer in your fridge and freezer that can provide an accurate temperature reading even if the power is out. Freezer temperatures should be at or below 0°F and the fridge at 40°F. • Store food on shelves high enough that it will not be contaminated in case of flood. • Have coolers on hand to keep food cold if the power is out for more than four hours. Keep the fridge and freezer doors closed as much as possible. • Discard perishables, such as meat, fish, cheese, milk, eggs, leftovers and deli items, if the power is out for more than four hours. • Use bottled water if you are concerned about your water supply. If you don't have bottled water, boil water and let it cool before storing to drink.  “I urge all Floridians to remain vigilant and stay alert to local weather and news,” said Congresswoman Wilson. “As you prepare for Hurricane Irma, please visit FloridaDisaster.org for more hurricane readiness and safety plan tips.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1618332044884489/?type=3",NA,13,10,0,1,0,0,0,1

Wilson Statement on the Death of a 12th Hollywood Hills Nursing Home Resident  Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson issued the following statement in response to the death of a twelfth Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills resident:  “I was horrified to learn today that the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills’ death toll is now at 12. Like Albertina Vega, Betty Hibbard, Gail Nova, Carolyn Eatherly, Martha Murray, Carlos Canal, Bobby Owens, Miguel Franco, Estella Hendricks, Manuel Mario Mendieta, and Constance Alice Thomas before her, Dolores Biamonte, 57, who passed away Thursday night, is a victim of the nursing home’s inexcusable negligence.   “I strongly believe that the loss of so many lives was more likely than not avertible, and I am joining Senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio and Governor Rick Scott in the call for federal and state investigations of the circumstances that has so far led to 12 tragedies. As I previously noted, the nursing home had been repeatedly cited for safety and other violations and should have been monitored to ensure that its residents were being properly cared for.   “Ever since news broke of the first deaths, I have vowed to do everything within my power to prevent similar needless tragedies from happening again.   “On September 19, I hosted a town hall that focused on strengthening compliance and standards at long-term care facilities. In addition, I launched an honorary task force at the event to address emergency first response efforts at long-term care facilities. Members include legislators, mayors, first responders, advocacy groups, long-term care providers, regional hospital administrators, and representatives from utility and energy companies who will work in smaller groups tasked with specific missions and goals.  “I also am introducing legislation to require nursing homes and other long-term health care facilities that receive federal funding and resources to have a backup generator or other power source to protect residents, particularly senior citizens, from severe weather conditions. Other measures include a bill to create a grant program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to fund generators and backup power source equipment for certain nursing homes and long-term care facilities, and another that would direct FEMA to prioritize assistance to nursing homes and long-term care facilities in response to a major disaster or emergency. In addition, I plan to host a field hearing on nursing home preparedness in the event of an emergency or natural disaster.  “I am deeply saddened by the deaths that occurred under the Rehabilitation Center’s watch. Such blatant disregard has highlighted the need for federal oversight to ensure that all health care facilities are acting responsibly, are properly equipped, and doing everything they can to safeguard the vulnerable people in their care.”","status",NA,NA,18,100,5,3,0,0,1,18

Wilson Statement on Provocative Performances by Students  MIAMI, FL – Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson (FL-24) issued the following statement in response to a Miami-Dade County High School dance-team’s provocative costumes and dance routines:  “While serving as a member of the Miami-Dade County School Board in 1997, I proposed Miami-Dade County School Board Rule 25B, which quickly became known as ‘the dirty dancing ban’ and prohibits performances that depict actual or simulated sexual intercourse, masturbation, excretory functions, and actual lewd exhibition of genitalia,” said Congresswoman Wilson.  “The rule was codified by the school board and received overwhelming support throughout our community.”  “I felt shocked and embarrassed after recently watching viral videos of Miami Northwestern Senior High School’s dance-team performance, which featured risqué costumes and sexual connotations and movements,” said Congresswoman Wilson.  “I was even more saddened that this took place at Miami Northwestern – a school that I love and of which I am a proud graduate.”   “Though these videos shined an international spotlight on Miami Northwestern, it is clear this inappropriate behavior is not germane to just this particular school; this issue applies to all of our already fragile schools.  These sexually provocative dance routines and costumes are unsuitable for school performances.  Further, what kind of value system are we embedding in the hearts and minds of our young women when these risqué costumes cost anywhere from $800 to $1200 per costume and multiple costume changes are required each school year?”  “These issues make it abundantly clear that Miami-Dade County School Board Rule 25B, which I proposed in 1997, is not being enforced.  When I proposed this rule 20 years ago, I acknowledged that dance and band performances at events or in educational settings are essential to the establishment and maintenance of an atmosphere that fosters cultural and artistic exchanges.  But certain modes of dance are inappropriate, unsuited for immature audiences, and may offend the community's sense of propriety rather than foster appropriate conduct.  While performances that go beyond the limits imposed by this rule may be held in a private setting outside of the school environment, these types of performances are unacceptable in Miami-Dade County schools.”  “It is up to the superintendent, the school board, and school principals to enforce this rule to protect our children's well-being, and the image of our public schools.  This is not just a Miami Northwestern Senior High School issue.  The rule is being broken at many Miami-Dade County schools and I am calling on Superintendent Alberto Carvalho to use his bully pulpit to address this issue.  These sexually provocative performances must stop now.”","status",NA,NA,51,289,15,9,4,0,0,20

La David Johnson, who was killed during a joint mission with the Niger military:  “I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of U.S. Army Sgt. La David Johnson of Miami Gardens. He is one of four American soldiers killed in Niger in an ambush carried out by Boko Haram and other extremists linked to ISIS-West Africa. Sgt. Johnson, 25, was in Niger to provide training and assistance to Nigeria’s military and the Multinational Joint Task Force created to combat extremists in the region.   “For the past several years, Boko Haram has terrorized Nigeria and its border nations. More than three years ago, the group gained global attention after kidnapping nearly 300 Nigerian school girls from their dormitory rooms in the province of Chibok.   “Ever since I learned of the Chibok Girls’ kidnapping, 113 of whom are still being held hostage, I have worked tirelessly to ensure that the girls are not forgotten and to raise awareness about this dangerous organization. I also have made four trips to Nigeria to meet with government officials, parents of the victims, and hundreds of other victims of Boko Haram.  “Boko Haram has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, sexually abused women and girls, and has also sent them on suicide bomb missions.   “To combat this scourge, Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) and I passed a bill, signed into law in December 2016, that among other things directs the secretaries of the State and Defense departments and the director of National Intelligence to jointly develop a five-year strategy to end Boko Haram’s reign of terror and to assist the Nigerian government, the Multinational Joint Task Force, and international partners to counter this regional threat.   “It is imperative that the world understands that Boko Haram is not a problem that impacts Nigeria, its border nations or Africans alone, but nations across the globe, including the United States that have committed to help defeat this terrorist group. We must never forget that its casualties may well include one or more of our own, as in the case of Sgt. Johnson.”  ###","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1648982151819478/?type=3",NA,152,775,49,40,1,1,121,22

Wilson Stands By Account of President Trump’s Condolence Call to the Widow of Sgt. La David Johnson  Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson issued the following statement in response to White House allegations regarding her account of President Donald Trump’s call with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson:  “Despite President Trump’s suggestion that I have recanted my statement or misstated what he said, I stand firmly by my original account of his conversation with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson. Moreover, this account has been confirmed by family members who also witnessed Mr. Trump’s incredible lack of compassion and sensitivity.   “The Johnson family and the families of the three other soldiers who tragically lost their lives in the Niger ambush are experiencing what I am certain must feel like an unbearable loss. Rather than engage in a petty war of words with Mr. Trump, it is so much more important to embrace and support the families and honor these fallen heroes.   “This is personal for me, not political. Sgt. Johnson was a member of my community and of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project that I founded to help boys of color build successful futures. He was killed while on a mission to provide training and security assistance to West African armed forces battling vicious insurgents like Boko Haram, the group whose defeat I’ve been fighting for since it abducted nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls more than three years ago.  “The loved ones Sgt. Johnson leaves behind are my constituents and my job now is to do all that I can to help them heal. I’ll save the bully pulpit for the necessary task of uncovering the circumstances surrounding the ambush and working to help ensure that our soldiers have all of the resources and support that they need while putting their lives on the line to keep others safe.”   ###","status",NA,NA,833,5056,260,269,54,9,34,897

Wilson has added important language to the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. The bipartisan legislation, which has been considered and approved by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, “focuses on improving pre-disaster planning and mitigation to reduce the future loss of life and the rising costs of disasters.”  “The measure requires FEMA to provide much-needed disaster response guidance and assistance to ensure that nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are better prioritized and can function or return to functioning status as soon as possible during and after power outages,” the Florida lawmaker said. “This is a top priority for me.”   The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills was unable to power its air conditioning system after Hurricane Irma swept across Florida. Instead of taking patients to the fully powered hospital across the street, the nursing home forced patients, many of them elderly, to endure extreme temperatures. Fourteen people died as a result of the facility’s dereliction of duty to safeguard its patients.  Since the tragedy, which is believed to have been preventable, Congresswoman Wilson has taken several steps to improve nursing home emergency preparedness in her state and across the nation, including a district town hall meeting at which she launched a long-term care emergency response task force to address first response efforts at long-term care facilities and a congressional field hearing in Miami on nursing homes’ emergency preparedness and response to disasters.  In a letter to Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Ranking Member Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Congresswoman Wilson, joined by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), called on the committee to investigate the tragedy at Hollywood Hills so that lawmakers can “understand what led to such a horrific incident and how we can prevent such a tragedy in the future.”  Congresswoman Wilson and 36 House members also have written to the heads of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to urge the agencies to “consider additional regulations requiring some nursing homes to possess alternate energy sources that can sustain heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and to maintain a fuel supply that will last for at least seven days. The lawmakers also are calling on the agencies to consider regulations that would encourage state and local municipalities to warehouse additional alternate energy sources they can easily access in the event that their emergency plans fail.  In addition, the Florida Democrat plans to introduce legislation that will require nursing homes and other long-term care facilities that receive federal funding and resources to have a backup generator or other power source to protect residents, particularly senior citizens, from severe weather conditions.  “The 14 Rehabilitation Center residents didn’t have to die,” she says. “We have to do all that we can to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1704397042944655/?type=3",NA,24,8,2,2,1,1,0,0

House Republicans, in a largely party line vote, passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which will force every state in the nation to recognize concealed carry standards from every other state.  “Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia currently prohibit individuals convicted of violent misdemeanors from obtaining concealed carry permits. But if H.R. 38 becomes law, someone from another state who would be ineligible to carry a concealed weapon in Florida will be able to do so.  “It is as if they have forgotten that just two months ago in Las Vegas, 58 people were killed and 546 were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in recent history. A month later, 26 people were shot and killed in a rural Texas church. Last year, in my home state, 50 people were killed at an Orlando nightclub and next week will mark the fifth anniversary of the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children dead.  “Given the unprecedentedly high level of gun violence in this country, passing such a bill defies logic. Yet, instead of passing measures to keep Americans safer, such as banning bump stocks, House Republicans have chosen to undermine states’ rights and put the lives of their constituents and mine at risk. And adding insult to injury, they tied their heinous bill to bipartisan legislation that aims to strengthen the nation’s criminal background check system.  “I don’t get it and hope and pray that Senate lawmakers don’t either and overwhelmingly reject this bill.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1706488052735554/?type=3",NA,213,46,34,30,6,1,6,3

The package includes language provided by Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson to protect seniors in nursing homes during natural disasters.    “Hurricanes are as much a part of Florida’s ecosystem as its coral reefs, so we must be as proactive as possible in how we prepare for these inevitable storms. Such planning will help us save lives and reduce recovery costs,” the congresswoman said.  Congresswoman Wilson’s language requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide training and guidance annually that will ultimately assist nursing homes and long term care facilities to better prepare for power outages during a major natural disaster or other emergency and return to functioning status following such events.  The congresswoman’s language was in fact a direct response to the multiple-day delay in restoring power at the Rehabilitation Center in Hollywood Hills, which resulted in the deaths of 14 residents, the majority of whom were senior citizens.    Specifically, the language says:                   Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall provide guidance and training on an annual basis to State, Tribal, and local governments, first responders, and utility companies on— (1) the need to prioritize assistance to hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-term care facilities to ensure that such health care facilities remain functioning or return to functioning as soon as practicable during power outages caused by natural hazards, including severe weather events; and (2) how hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities should adequately prepare for power outages during a major disaster or emergency. This is another effort by Congresswoman Woman to protect seniors and others who rely on nursing homes for care. When Congress returns in 2018, she will file legislation to mandate generators in nursing homes and prioritize nursing homes and long-term care facilities for power restoration following a disaster or emergency, and to award grants to nursing homes and long-term care facilities to help them purchase a generator or prepare for an emergency power outage.  Since the tragic deaths of 14 residents of the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, the congresswoman has taken several steps to improve nursing home emergency preparedness in her state and across the nation, including a district town hall meeting at which she launched a long-term care emergency response task force to address first response efforts at long-term care facilities and a congressional field hearing in Miami on nursing homes’ emergency preparedness and response to disasters.  In a letter to Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Ranking Member Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Congresswoman Wilson, joined by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), called on the committee to investigate the tragedy at Hollywood Hills so that lawmakers can “understand what led to such a horrific incident and how we can prevent such a tragedy in the future.”  Congresswoman Wilson and 36 House members also have written to the heads of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to urge the agencies to “consider additional regulations requiring some nursing homes to possess alternate energy sources that can sustain heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and to maintain a fuel supply that will last for at least seven days. The lawmakers also are calling on the agencies to consider regulations that would encourage state and local municipalities to warehouse additional alternate energy sources they can easily access in the event that their emergency plans fail.  In addition, the Florida Democrat plans to introduce legislation that will require nursing homes and other long-term care facilities that receive federal funding and resources to have a backup generator or other power source to protect residents, particularly senior citizens, from severe weather conditions. . “The family and friends of the 14 people who died as a result of the Hollywood Hills nursing home’s negligence are struggling to find the strength to celebrate this holiday season and bring in the New Year without their loved ones. As lawmakers it is our duty to do all that we can to mitigate the possibility of such a disaster ever happening again—otherwise, the negligence will be ours,” she said.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepWilson/photos/a.200110313373343.59229.162327487151626/1721262381258121/?type=3",NA,60,6,9,11,0,0,0,0
