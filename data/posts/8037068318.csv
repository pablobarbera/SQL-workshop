I voted NO on the “Make America Secure Act”, which allocates $1.6 billion in taxpayer funds for the building of a wall along the U.S. and Mexico border.    Read my statement:   “Since our nation’s inception, it has been shaped and defined by immigration. Our nation was built with the blood, sweat and tears of immigrants.  But today, sadly, House Republicans passed a measure that flies in the face of that history.    “To be clear, this wall will not make us safer. But it does serve as symbol of the President’s hateful, anti-immigrant rhetoric – like the language he used just this week in talking about ‘innocent, beautiful’ girls being – and I quote – ‘sliced and diced’, presumably by immigrants.      “That is the cynical politics of bigotry and fear – and it is the real motivation for this wall. But this funding is not just an affront to our national values.  This wall is bad policy, ineffective -- and a waste of taxpayer dollars.  Remember when candidate Trump promised that Mexico would ‘pay’ for his wall?  It didn’t take long for the Mexican government to expose that broken promise.    “This shameful bill includes 1.6 billion dollars to fund Mr. Trump’s boondoggle. That’s $1.6 billion that could go toward real, lasting job creation – or hiring more teachers – or fixing crumbling roads and bridges.  But, instead, Mr. Trump needs to fuel the politics of fear – and what better way to do so than at the taxpayer expense? We are better than this than this bigoted and wasteful proposal and I will continue to oppose its enactment.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepNydiaVelazquez/photos/a.444234258318.227011.8037068318/10155696952968319/?type=3",NA,70,10,10,4,1,0,2,2

And, yes, these are Americans. Many of them have known no other home. Some of them speak only English and many came here when they were so young that they cannot even remember the journey.  Their parents brought them here in search of a better life, seeking that simple, but uniquely American compact – the promise that America is the land of opportunity, where anyone with a dream and the right talent and perseverance can succeed.  Today, Donald Trump has turned his back on that proud tradition.   Not only is this decision a moral affront, but this policy, if it takes effect, will cause billions of dollars of economic damage. It is telling that business leaders from a range of sectors have united in opposition DACA’s rescission.     Where the President has failed to show moral leadership, Congress must step forward.  In coming weeks, I will be working with my Democratic colleagues to push the Republican Leadership to allow for an up-or-down vote on a clean ‘DREAM Act’, so these young people – the face of America – are protected.","status",NA,NA,164,30,43,21,0,1,3,28

President Trump and the current Administration have promoted policies aimed at vilifying recent immigrants and Latinos.  This rhetoric and these actions are an affront to our American values and we reject them. In that regard, it is imperative that Congress swiftly come together to protect the 800,000 bright young DREAMers who are American in every way except on paper.

A recent study found that, under this latest Republican proposal, within ten years, New York would lose $33 million from its healthcare funding.    Several Republican Senators took politically courageous votes in rejecting previous iterations of this abysmal legislation.  I encourage them to keep opposing proposals that would so profoundly hurt the working families they purportedly represent.  Republican leadership is looking to rush this measure through, without even an analysis by the independent Congressional Budget Office showing how many Americans might lose coverage.    Make no mistake -- the latest version of Trumpcare would end Medicaid as we know it and gut commonsense protections that millions of Americans rely on to ensure they have basic health coverage. The Senate should not vote on this bill but, if they do, and if it should pass, I will do everything in my power in the House to oppose it.","status",NA,NA,24,0,1,1,0,0,0,2

Meanwhile, the people of Puerto Rico have been facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Millions of American citizens are without food, water and electricity. Now, the President’s change of heart is too little, too late.  A ten-day waiver, as the Administration has announced, is far from sufficient given the scope of this tragedy.  Moreover, as Puerto Rico begins the long road of rebuilding, it will be difficult to do so if building supplies cost double what they are priced on the mainland. To that end, I repeat my previous call for a one-year waiver of the Jones Act.  Puerto Rico’s economy was already suffering immensely before Maria and its economy will undoubtedly be devastated from the hurricane. If there were ever a time to consider a longer term suspension of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico, this would be it.","status",NA,NA,355,64,182,19,0,2,31,50

Much more needs to be done, but, for now the bill includes critical measures that the Island needs in the short term to respond to this once-in-a-generation humanitarian crisis. Importantly, in addition to funding emergency assistance from FEMA, the legislation helps address pressing liquidity needs of the Puerto Rican government by providing them with loans to meet a looming cash shortfall.  In doing so it is critical that Wall Street creditors are unable to access these federal funds, which are solely intended to help Puerto Ricans begin to rebuild their lives.   Going forward, Puerto Rico faces a long path to full recovery and we cannot rest until the Island is made whole. I fully expect Congress to provide additional assistance, including rebuilding the energy grid, repairing telecommunications networks and mending the infrastructure system. We must also ensure a long term fix for Puerto Rico’s long ailing Medicaid system, something that was a critical priority before Maria, but is even more important now.

Yet, one month after Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, seventy five percent of the Island remains without electrical power.    PREPA has made clear it is not equipped for the enormous task of quickly restoring the Island’s power. Initially, the utility decided to forego ‘mutual aid’ agreements with other power authorities that have previously proven effective in rapidly restoring power in other hurricane-impacted areas.  The Authority’s dubious decision to contract with a small, inexperienced and obscure company further underscored the need for intervention.  It is therefore completely appropriate for the Board to step in by making this appointment. As I have said previously, under PROMESA, the Oversight Board is not just authorized to take this action -- it has a legal responsibility to do so. This appointment should be approved expeditiously.   Going forward, the new CTO should present a clear plan as to how it will work with FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  There must be full transparency throughout this process so the U.S. taxpayer has confidence federal resources are being wisely spent and, more importantly, that everything possible is being done to assist the Puerto Rican people and quickly restore power.","status",NA,NA,89,13,48,4,0,3,5,14

Despite claims to the contrary – in black and white in the contract - FEMA has now stated publicly and unequivocally that it never approved the contract.  Moreover, the agency is suggesting it could potentially not release funds to pay for work being performed.  As this fiasco unfolds, three-quarters of Puerto Rico still remains without power. The question now becomes -- what is next?  This boondoggle needs to end. Taxpayers need to know their dollars are spent wisely and, even more importantly, power restoration in Puerto Rico must happen quickly.  To that end, the contract with Whitefish should be voided. PREPA should move to enter mutual aid agreements with other power authorities to rapidly restore power. If PREPA requires additional authority to take such steps, they should make that clear immediately.   People in Puerto Rico are suffering and dying.  Government waste and abuse should never be acceptable, but these actions are especially irresponsible during a humanitarian crisis when lives are at stake.","status",NA,NA,71,14,57,3,0,5,10,29

The bill does not include cost sharing for recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.  It provides nothing to address Puerto Rico’s Medicaid crisis.  While the Continuing Resolution provides $1 billion for that purpose, given the size of the shortfall, those funds are a drop in the bucket.  The Governor of Puerto Rico has requested $94 billion for Maria recovery and rebuilding. Instead, House Republicans have presented a measure that would provide $81 billion – an already insufficient amount to be split between Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas and areas impacted by wildfires.  Simply put, more resources are needed. Congress has a long tradition of coming together in a bipartisan fashion after disasters.  In that vein, I’ll continue pressing my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to allocate more resources to assist our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico.  If Congress does not do so, it would constitute an abject moral failure.   Finally, let me note that while Republicans incorporated some tax provisions into this package, they did not extend the earned income tax credit to the island, nor expand the child tax credit so that it is consistent with what is provided to other states.  I will continue pushing for this type of assistance in the future.","status",NA,NA,72,16,21,10,1,1,8,3
