The post chose Congressman Comer because he was one of only 12 Congressmen who hosted a town hall event that week, and the only Congressman who hosted more than one.

Their reporter was very professional, spent three full days meeting real people throughout KY-1, and did several fact checks with Congressman Comer before the story was published. It was very refreshing for the Congressman to see a credible reporter with a real newspaper write an accurate account of President Trump's status among the people in KY-1.
