Her PAC, All Children Matter, owes the state of Ohio for campaign finance violations, the largest fines ever levied in Ohio history.

These are the same Senators who will now confirm her for the Secretary of Education position.   No one is above law.

The statement by a State Department spokesman that the Secretary’s statement was a ‘rhetorical device’ only adds to the uncertainties about what the basic policies are of the current administration. The Secretary’s statement also seems contradictory to his earlier statements in support of sanctions against Russia.
