Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Boozman (R-Ark.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). The legislation would close the legal loophole that requires immigration authorities to release back into the United States illegal aliens who have not been accepted for deportation to other countries after being detained for six months; a practice also referred to as ""catch and release.""  I also co-sponsored Kate’s Law, Sarah’s Law, the Taking Action Against Drunk Drivers Act and a bill to make aliens associated with a criminal gang inadmissible, deportable and ineligible for various forms of relief, which were also introduced in the Senate today. As the current law stands, an illegal alien with a criminal record is released back into the United States after six months if no other country accepts them for deportation. This catch-and-release practice puts our law abiding citizens, local law enforcement officials and communities at risk; it is time we passed commonsense legislation to protect them. The Keep Our Communities Safe Act closes the catch-and-release loophole and will ensure that illegal aliens who have been found guilty of violent crimes and aggravated felonies are not able to remain in our communities. The fact of the matter is that we need to protect American citizens first and foremost by ensuring those aliens who break our laws and threaten our safety are removed. There are far too many incidences of illegal aliens not being appropriately punished after committing heinous crimes.

Time and again terrorists have stated their intent to infiltrate refugee populations in order to spread their ideology and terror throughout the West, as has already happened in Europe. Furthermore, the pause on visa applicants for countries that Congress and the Departments of State and Homeland Security have determined as areas of concern to national security is reasonable given the unrest and state of instability in each of those countries. President Trump’s measures are temporary and will allow for the new administration to review and strengthen our immigration programs. The administration should have delayed implementation of this order so that the agencies, airlines and foreign travelers could have prepared and made arrangements in compliance, but I am confident these issues will be addressed swiftly to reduce confusion and uncertainty. The Trump administration is comprised of well-respected experts, and it is imperative that Senate Democrats immediately allow for the confirmation of his cabinet picks so that the President’s policies are well implemented.

The president’s budget, which balances spending and reduces debt, takes a sharp turn away from the wasteful policies of the past administration and ensures taxpayer dollars are used wisely and on policies that will have meaningful impacts for all Americans. I often say that there’s an old, worn-out document that no one reads anymore called the Constitution which assigns lawmakers in Congress to do two things, defend the country and provide for our infrastructure. The budget includes $639 billion for the Department of Defense, a significant boost that our military desperately needs as we continue to fulfill the president’s promise of rebuilding our troops. The budget also paves a path to meet the goal of one trillion dollars in infrastructure investments. In his FY 18 Budget, Trump, who in just his first few months has taken a strong stance against overregulation at the hands of Washington bureaucrats, generates opportunities for increased economic prosperity and job creation without the burden of red tape. Notably, the president has proposed a 30 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency—one of, if not the most, bloated federal agencies. This cut to EPA will right-size the agency and return the focus to protecting air, land and water instead of churning out regulations. I am pleased with the president’s budget proposal and I am glad to be working in a Washington that is once again prioritizing economic success, a strong military and a government that is more accountable but less intrusive.","status",NA,NA,577,353,102,63,13,5,7,216

In passing this legislation, the Senate is finally holding Iran accountable for its aggressive and inappropriate behavior.

While Director Morgan has made some great improvements at Muskogee, this report makes clear there is still room for improvement to ensure our VA hospitals provide quality healthcare to our veterans. Our VA hospitals should be held to the same standards as private hospitals and outside oversight is the best way to achieve that. VISN directors, like Gigliotti, should be empowered to contract with outside entities to conduct investigations into their facilities and my bill, S. 1266, the Enhancing Veteran Care Act would allow them to do just that.
