The heroic claims of the agreement do not match reality. At best the agreement is a feel good measure that will have nearly zero benefit. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which organized the Paris Agreement, calculates that if every nation abides by the agreement for the next 15 years global temperature rise would be slowed by a mere .07 degrees Fahrenheit. Adding insult to injury, researchers at Stanford peg the cost of compliance at $154 billion to the U.S. economy per year and a trillion dollars globally. The Paris Agreement is a boat anchor that will increase the cost of energy and make it harder to get poor people around the world out of poverty.  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448121/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-trump-should-scrap-accord","link","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448121/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-trump-should-scrap-accord","nationalreview.com",348,288,74,30,4,4,11,275

Not only do we have over three times the number of Wild Horses on the range than is recommended by land use management plans, we have another 50,000 horses living out their lives in Bureau of Land Management (BLM) corrals. Just caring and feeding the horses currently held by BLM will cost U.S. taxpayers over a billion dollars. The status quo is unacceptable.

The report represents part of the final attempt by an outgoing administration to regulate America’s vast energy reserves so much so that they are economically unviable.  This so-called “roadmap” will not only put coal miners out of jobs, it’s a life sentence of hamstrung economic opportunity in the communities that have been the most devastated by President Obama’s extremist environmental agenda.   The department’s suggestion that the government doesn’t receive a fair return in royalties or land usage and that the environmental reviews for coal leasing are deficient is nonsense. Under current regulations, each of the sites in the federal coal program undergo extensive environmental review that includes public comment, a process that regularly takes a decade per location. The sites also undergo extensive suitability and economic evaluation to determine the fair market value of minable resources. Leases to mine this coal are sold at auction to the highest bidder and if the Department of the Interior suspects the leases are underbid, it reserves the right to withhold a lease.   Let’s be clear about the intention of this announcement: make coal mining on public land unprofitable through regulation. The federal coal program brings in billions of dollars in royalty payments that are shared with the states. These royalties are used for education, safety and infrastructure improvements. The Department of Interior should abandon this unnecessary process. I look forward to Incoming Secretary Zinke putting a stop to this and so many other job-killing policies.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/11/outgoing-obama-interior-department-calls-for-major-reform-of-federal-coal-program/?utm_term=.2c221b665f9f","washingtonpost.com",40,46,12,0,1,2,1,8

The land that surrounds these twin buttes is a beautiful region of our state that merits special protection.

The same federal agencies with the same resources and personnel will continue their same work as usual. The people on the ground are provided virtually nothing new to help protect the area they love. The only difference with this monument designation is that government bureaucrats can now direct new land-management plans. Once completed, these plans will be subject to the whims and fancies of a federal land manager.

But the President and Vice President must be able to trust their advisors completely and given the current situation I agree that General Flynn could no longer serve effectively as National Security Advisor.   In addition to the breach of trust, I am alarmed to yet again see an example of very sensitive information being leaked to the public. As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I am troubled by the seemingly continuous leaks of classified information and the national security problems they inevitably cause. I am committed to ending those leaks.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",62,77,8,1,0,4,9,3

In the past few years it has unfortunately been used as a slush fund, providing billions of dollars to Iran and attempting to bailout insurance companies losing money on the Obamacare exchanges.   Unfortunately, this fund is not subject to the annual appropriations process, has lax reporting requirements, and any available information is offered only at the discretion of the President.   The federal government should always be transparent about how it uses tax dollars. This bill is a critical fix that will show us who the government is paying and how much when it settles or loses lawsuits, and it will prevent the fund from being used as a slush fund for political purposes.","link","http://stewart.house.gov/transparency","stewart.house.gov",62,25,1,2,0,0,0,0
