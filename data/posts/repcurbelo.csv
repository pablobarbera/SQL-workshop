Instead, the Administration chose to wait until the last hour to act, and as usual collaborated directly with the Cuban dictatorship instead of consulting members of Congress. America’s policy toward Cuba should serve to advance U.S. interests, and it should never be coordinated with anti-American dictators.  Although our country's immigration policy toward Cuba has granted many of the dictatorship's victims refuge, it has also been grossly abused and exploited by many Cuban nationals, while also inadvertently bolstering the Cuban regime. A change to this policy was inevitable. I remain firmly committed to supporting the victims of persecution in Cuba while ending all abuses of America’s generosity.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepCurbelo/videos/1226868540724002/",NA,179,48,89,9,1,0,1,6

While Obamacare had some positive reforms, including coverage for preexisting conditions and allowing children to remain on their parents’ plans longer, this law is falling apart. My office has received many complaints over the last two years about our current healthcare system, and I have no doubt that all Americans - especially the most vulnerable - deserve better. Quite simply, the Affordable Care Act has broken its promise to lower costs and offer more and better choices to the American people.   Today’s budget reconciliation package is an important first step in building a truly patient-centered healthcare system that lowers the costs of care, expands access to providers, puts consumers in control, and respects our doctors and healthcare professionals. Unlike Obamacare, our reform legislation will not be written by health insurance companies, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies or other special interests. Instead it will be written for American families who need and deserve quality healthcare.","status",NA,NA,40,15,2,1,0,1,0,0

Carlos Curbelo","2017-02-14","2017-02-14 21:55:17","One of the greatest blemishes on human history is the genocide that has taken place in Syria over the last few years. Over 500,000 human beings have died, including approxiamtely 50,000 children. More than ten million people have been displaced, resulting in a refugee crisis that has destabilized Europe and put gruesome images on our television and phone screens, all while ISIS grew and inspired terror throughout the world. Our country, under the leadership of President Obama, and our democratic allies around the world share the blame in this. Obama clearly stated there would be serious consequences if Bashar al Assad used chemical weapons against civilians – it was one of his Administration’s red lines. Assad proceeded to do just that, gassing innocent people to death including children with total impunity. While many opinion leaders implored the civilized world to act, warning the consequences of inaction were far greater than the consequences of action, only the French expressed a willingness to intervene.   Not only did the Obama Administration fail to act at that critical point in 2013, they also invited the Russians into the conflict. For three more years innocent Syrians were bombed to death by Assad and Russian military forces. Hospitals and schools were destroyed, and the civilized world just watched as Aleppo and others cities burned.  In short, with few exceptions, Obama and other world leaders - including those of majority Muslim countries - turned their backs on the Syrian people. It was shameful and unforgivable and will have many harmful ramifications for years to come. The lesson is American leadership is necessary in the world. Serious world conflicts we ignore will eventually show up in our homeland.   There are many Americans expressing outrage at the new Administration’s executive orders issued hastily their first week in office. I understand these legitimate concerns. I also wonder if these same Americans were as adamant, or if they raised their voices at all, while the previous Administration patiently observed the genocide of the Syrian people. The new Administration should learn from these terrible missteps of the past. We should demand intense vetting of Syrian refugees, not summarily reject them all – especially not precious children who deserve a future. We should also accept - not shy away from - our responsibility as the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/middleeast/syrian-chlorine-bombs-aleppo-human-rights-watch.html?src=twr&smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0","nytimes.com",43,42,18,1,0,0,11,8

Bashar al Assad is a terrorist and has no place in the community of world leaders.     Tragically, this attack and others like it could have been avoided. Our country, under the leadership of the previous Administration, and our democratic allies around the world share the blame for Assad’s crimes against humanity. The red line for using chemical weapons against civilians was ignored and the deal with Russia to remove these weapons from Syria was clearly a charade. Regrettably, the new Administration has thus far failed to inspire confidence on Syria by stating just last week that Assad abandoning power is no longer a priority. This is unacceptable. The President and the State Department should reconsider before more innocent civilians and children are gassed to death.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html","nytimes.com",50,20,31,0,0,1,20,10

Carlos Curbelo","2017-05-04","2017-05-04 23:14:52","While the Affordable Care Act has helped some Americans, the reality is, for many the law is falling short. Over 1,000 counties across the country, including Monroe in South Florida, are left with a single insurance provider, meaning fewer choices, lower quality, and higher costs. I refuse to condemn my community and the country to a health care system burdened by ever-increasing costs, fewer options, government threats and fines against citizens, rampant fraud, inefficiency, and mismanagement. So along with my colleagues, I’ve been working on legislation to create a truly patient-centered healthcare system where every American has access to quality care.   This proposal builds off the positive aspects of the ACA that have strong bipartisan support, such as prohibiting discrimination against women, allowing young Americans to remain on their parents’ plans, and assuring protections for those suffering from preexisting conditions. By working with likeminded colleagues from all across the country, since this legislation was first filed we have secured $38 billion dollars in additional funding to support the most vulnerable Americans and to bolster maternity, mental health services, and access to healthcare for those suffering from pre-existing conditions.   For weeks I had indicated a major priority for me was for the Department of Health and Human Services to restore Florida’s Low Income Pool funding, which had been drastically and unfairly cut by the previous Administration. These funds support important safety net hospitals, like Jackson Memorial in South Florida. Recently, Secretary Price authorized $1.5 billion dollars in additional funding, which will help compensate these hospitals and their doctors for care provided to poor and undocumented residents, and for the many millions who remain uninsured under the ACA.   Today’s vote is just a step in the legislative process for this bill – not the end of it. We have worked hard to improve the legislation, but we have a long way to go. I have received assurances that the concerns I maintain will be addressed in the Senate, and for weeks I have been in contact with several offices there to make sure we are working collaboratively. A major priority is to increase the resources available to lower-income Americans and those approaching the age of retirement. I will continue listening to my constituents, doctors, health professionals, and other experts to make sure our decisions are as informed as possible. I approach this issue with a great deal of care and sobriety. For me this isn’t about ideology, partisan politics or presidential legacies, it is simply about building a sustainable healthcare system that empowers every American to make the best decisions for themselves and their families, and supports the neediest in our society. It's about putting patient interests first and above the special and government interests that have controlled the healthcare system for far too long. Now this process continues.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepCurbelo/videos/1339586756118846/",NA,191,298,98,16,1,1,8,247

It’s not only disappointing to see the President ignore that mandate, it’s unacceptable. Congress needs to take action to ensure our military installations around the world are adapting and mitigating when it comes to climate change, and I challenge the Members of the Climate Solutions Caucus to step up to help lead that effort.","link","http://time.com/5068604/trump-obama-climate-change-national-security/","time.com",57,42,13,6,5,0,5,9

Like with any other broad, complex bill, there are provisions I would remove and others I would add. However, on the balance, this legislation will be good for our country. It will help all American workers, especially young people and immigrants who are seeking greater opportunities to grow and prosper. Most importantly, it gets us closer to fulfilling America's promise - that all who are willing to work hard and earn it can find their success in our country.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepCurbelo/videos/1554143034663216/",NA,101,122,11,3,3,0,6,88
