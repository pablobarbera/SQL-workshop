As I explained at the hearing, while the administration’s budget proposes an overall cut of some 32 percent, the budget protects several programs that enjoy strong congressional support, including for HIV/AIDS, for malaria, and for vaccines.  Funding for embassy security and security assistance for Israel are maintained at current levels.  These are good priorities.  But I am concerned about how cuts would impact other priorities – including efforts to combat terrorists, poachers, and human traffickers. U.S. leadership was key to stopping Ebola in West Africa, and continued engagement is needed to address future threats before they hit our shores.  And many are rightly worried about how proposed cuts will impact humanitarian assistance at a time when more than 65 million people have been displaced around this globe by conflict and at a time when famine looms in four countries.","video","https://www.facebook.com/EdRoyce/videos/10155272373040559/",NA,101,24,18,2,0,0,0,3

Experts predict North Korea will be able to hit the U.S. with an ICBM in less than four years.  Meanwhile, Kim Jong Un is taking aggressive steps to make North Korea a fully armed nuclear state.  Today, the House passed two measures to push back against that aggression.  There is no question that North Korea’s support for terrorism has advanced right alongside its sophisticated weapons program.  Just look at the recent news of the assassination of Kim Jong Un’s half-brother.  It is time for us to ramp up the pressure.  That is why I am supporting these measures today, which urge the State Department to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terror and condemn North Korea’s development of an ICBM.  By passing these measures, we are taking important steps to push back against North Korea’s dangerous ambitions.

But as we celebrate this holiday, it’s important to remember the Founding Fathers who gave us the precious gift of freedom. ​These brave revolutionaries united against an oppressive King in order to secure our God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Today, let us reflect on those ideals and what it means to be an American. Let us remember the courageous men and women that have sacrificed so much in defense of our liberty and freedoms that we enjoy today. Let us recognize the significance of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence some 241 years ago.  ​ Take a minute to re-read that important document that sparked a revolution and established the God-given rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for every American: http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/","photo","https://www.facebook.com/EdRoyce/photos/a.389330755558.167397.6460640558/10155618692545559/?type=3",NA,173,38,13,12,0,0,0,1

He saw— and documented what he saw—the ovens with bodies stacked like cord wood, the rail cars and trenches filled with the dead in the Holocaust. Stopping the evil of the Nazis from spreading across Europe is what so many of my father’s friends fought and died for.  And while the world may be different today, our veterans continue to stand for justice, compassion, and liberty. The military service of my father and the other 19 million American veterans continues to inspire future generations. We should honor them not just today, on Veterans’ Day, but 365 days a year.

In order to compete in a 21st century economy, California families and small businesses need tax relief—not more of the status quo. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act focuses on boosting growth and helping people across the board keep more of what they earn.   According to the analysis conducted by the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would lead to an increase of 111,108 new full time jobs in California over the next 10 years. Additionally, the median household in California would see a gain of $2,932 in after-tax income.   Enacting pro-growth tax policies will directly lead to more economic prosperity for every single American. While this bill is not perfect, it’s a good start.
