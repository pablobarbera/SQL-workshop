I’m especially pleased to vote for bills that support our veterans, and the bills that will reduce the harmful effects of executive-branch rules and regulations that by-pass Congressional review.   H.R. 26– Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017 - This legislation curbs unnecessary major regulations from unaccountable bureaucrats by requiring agencies to submit major regulations, those costing more than $100 million in economic effect, to Congress for approval. It also guarantees fast up or down votes on major rules, as Congress must act within 70 legislative days.   .  I voted YES.   H.R. 71– Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act – This legislation would increase information and taxpayer transparency regarding the cost and performance of certain federal programs.  .  I voted YES.  H.R. 21– Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 - This legislation solves the problem of midnight rules with one simple stroke, amending the Congressional Review Act to allow CRA resolutions that disapprove of multiple midnight rules simultaneously by the incoming Congress. It sets neither a minimum nor a maximum number of midnight rules that a CRA resolution can disapprove.  .  I voted YES.  H.R. 21-Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act - This legislation takes the next steps vital to improving our Veterans Administration by granting the Department greater flexibility in removing employees based on poor performance or misconduct, while strengthening accountability and evaluation measures for all employees.  I voted YES.  H.R. 28– Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2017 - This legislation will direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adopt the FDA's unique device identification system for labeling all biological implants and to implement an automated inventory system to ensure veterans do not receive expired or otherwise contaminated tissue.  .  I voted YES.","status",NA,NA,118,11,12,4,1,2,0,0

Passage of the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628) comes at a crucial time, as Americans continue to face increasing premiums and fewer choices.   One third of US counties have only one insurance provider. Several insurers are looking to withdraw from the exchanges, leaving Americans who buy their own insurance without options. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans skip doctor visits to avoid high costs, even with coverage.  Premiums are expected to skyrocket 22% this year. Recently, one young family told me that they realized that they couldn’t afford the massive $8,000 deductible associated with their daughter’s RSV check.   Unfortunately, these stories are not uncommon, and they show why maintaining the status quo is unacceptable.  My vote for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) is the beginning of the process to give Utahns access to quality and affordable healthcare, revamp the insurance markets and provide stability to those who do not have it.  It does this by giving the decisions and resources to the states and individuals rather than the federal government.  The federal government often dictates regulations to states like Utah, claiming to have a better answer than the people who live here.  Utahns will do much better than the federal government deciding what is best for them and their healthcare.    The AHCA also empowers states to control how they use their Medicaid funds.  It gives those without health insurance tax credits to buy the health insurance of their choosing allowing more market forces to be at play when it comes to choice of plans.  It also preserves protections for people with pre-existing conditions while giving states greater flexibility to lower premiums and stabilize the insurance market.   This is a first step.  I am committed to achieving a 21st century healthcare system that lowers costs, improves access and increases quality for Americans.","status",NA,NA,1119,878,134,117,2,8,23,766

Rep. Mia Love cosponsored this legislation introduced by U.S. Representative Martha McSally. (R) Arizona.  “Congress must abide by the laws it passes and should be treated no differently than other hardworking Americans,” Rep. Love said.  “Any law we pass that applies to our constituents must apply equally to Members of Congress as well. Anything short of that is hypocrisy,” said Rep. McSally. “My measure eliminates double standards by preventing Members of Congress from exempting themselves from American Health Care Act.”   Due to Senate procedural rules within the Budget Reconciliation process, the MacArthur Amendment to the American Health Care Act would exempt Members of Congress and their staff. H.R. 2192, is a standalone two-page bill that would repeal this exemption for Members of Congress should the American Health Care Act become law. The measure passed the House by a vote of 429-0.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repmialove/photos/a.337713383082993.1073741827.337652123089119/678262555694739/?type=3",NA,556,127,103,61,2,3,2,43

I voted YES.  H.R. 2473 - Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017, as amended: This bill directs the Attorney General to provide training to prosecutors on investigating and processing cases with a trauma-informed and victim-centered approach, and encourages state to provide appropriate services to victims of trafficking.

I voted YES.   Details:  This bill is a better way forward for America’s financial laws.  The CHOICE Act replaces the Dodd-Frank Act.   After the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession, Dodd-Frank promised reform.  Instead of lifting the economy, Dodd-Frank resulted in the slowest, weakest recovery in 70 years. Instead of ending taxpayer-funded bailouts, Wall Street bailouts were enshrined into law. Dodd-Frank promised to make the financial system safer, but big banks got even bigger, and small banks and credit unions became fewer. Consumers were supposed to be protected, but in fact Dodd-Frank resulted in higher bank fees, more expensive mortgages, fewer choices and the most unaccountable government agency in U.S. history. The Financial CHOICE Act would: End taxpayer-funded bailouts once and for all and ensure no company is ‘too big to fail’. Hold Wall Street accountable with the toughest penalties in history for fraud and deception. Reclaim power from the administrative state and give it back to the people and their representatives. Rein in the rogue Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to empower all Americans to achieve financial independence. Unleash opportunities for Main Street small businesses, innovators and job creators by eliminating onerous Washington regulations that are stifling access to credit and capital.    Also this week:   H.R. 2213, Anti Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017:  Border Patrol Agents and Customs Officers perform critical work, but are understaffed.  In order to maintain a level of national security, H.R. 2213 would waive polygraph tests for those who have already been vetted and served in law enforcement, the armed services or veterans with security clearance.   I voted YES.","status",NA,NA,128,51,12,8,1,0,2,47

It requires the Administration for Children & Families to make grants to states for demonstration projects that provide wage subsidies to low-income individuals. This will help them not only gain employment, but maintain it, as well. This bill also ensures that participants in state-subsidized job programs do not displace current workers. In support of strengthening the workforce and supporting low-income individuals, I voted YES.    6/22/17 H.R. 1654 (Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act)-- This bill established the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency for the approvals and decisions required by federal law to create new surface water storage projects. Such projects would occur in states covered by the Reclamation Act on lands administered by the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture. I support better-regulated water storage systems, so I voted YES.   6/22/17 H.R. 1873 (Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act)-- The Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture are required to ensure all rights-of-way for electrical transmission and distribution facilities on lands under their respective jurisdictions including requirements for utility vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance activities that meet certain requirements.

To ensure the best future for our nation’s young scholars, I voted YES.   6/20/17 H.R. 2866 (Reducing Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act)--  This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to find model standards for the licensing of our nation’s foster family homes. This legislation holds state foster care standards accountable ensuring that all children in foster care are treated properly. The bill also increases caseworker training and offers a plan to quickly place children in volatile situations with relatives. To ensure the safety of our nation’s foster care youths, I voted YES.    6/20/17 H.R. 2847 (Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act)-- This bill authorizes the states to extend foster care eligibility to age 21 and services to children and young adults in foster care to age 23.

It does so by allowing Utah's School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration to obtain certain lands, that have already been identified as available for transfer, by using remaining land grant credits from The Utah Enabling Act. I'm  excited to see this important legislation advance, and appreciate the work of the committee members in moving it forward with bipartisan support. This is a win for Utah.

I voted YES.   Threats to our national security by these nations undermine U.S. stability.  This bill holds them accountable. In order to ensure global stability, this is one of the most wide-ranging sanctions packages in history.

S. 114 - A bill to authorize appropriations for the Veterans Choice Program, and for other purposes, as amended  This bill authorizes and appropriates $2 billion to be available without fiscal year limitation for the Veterans Choice Fund. It extends through December 2027 the current $90 per month limit on a pension paid to veterans residing in nursing homes when their nursing costs are paid through Medicaid. It also extends through December 2027 the Secretary’s authority to collect fees for certain housing loans made, insured, or guaranteed by the VA. Lastly, it extends through December 2027 the Secretary’s authority to use IRS income information. I voted YES.
