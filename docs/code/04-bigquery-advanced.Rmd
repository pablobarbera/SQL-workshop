## More advanced queries

Now that we're familiar with Google BigQuery, let's play with a massively large dataset -- a table that contains all trips completed in Yellow and Green taxis in New York City from 2009 to present. You can find more information [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-tlc-trips). This is one of the many publicly-available Google BigQuery tables; one of them is also the GDELT project, and you can see some examples of queries [More](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/google-bigquery-gkg-2-0-sample-queries/).

Let's connect with this database and see how big it is:

```{r}
library(bigrquery)
project <- "usc-barbera"
set_service_token("~/credentials/bigquery-token.json")

get_table(project="nyc-tlc",
          dataset="yellow",
          table="trips")

# how many taxi trips in database?
query_exec(
  "SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]",
	project = project, useLegacySql = FALSE)
```

Not bad! What is the distribution of trips by year and by month?

```{r}
# number of trips per year?
query_exec(
  "SELECT YEAR(pickup_datetime) AS year, 
    COUNT(*) AS trips
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  GROUP BY year
  ORDER BY year",
  project=project, use_legacy_sql = TRUE)

# number of trips per month?
query_exec(
  "SELECT MONTH(pickup_datetime) AS month, 
    COUNT(*) AS trips
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month",
  project=project, use_legacy_sql = TRUE)
```

How would we compute the average speed?

```{r}
# First, let's compute distance and duration separately
query_exec(
  "SELECT AVG(trip_distance) AS avg_distance_miles,
  AVG( (dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)/1000000/60/60) 
      AS avg_duration_hours
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]",
   project=project)
# Now we can compute it in a single step
query_exec(
  "SELECT AVG(
      trip_distance / 
      ( (dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)/1000000/60/60 ) ) 
      AS avg_speed
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]",
   project=project)

# but it sounds like there might be some outliers, let's try to fix it:
query_exec(
  "SELECT AVG(
      trip_distance / 
      ( (dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)/1000000/60/60 ) ) 
      AS avg_speed
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  WHERE 
    trip_distance > 0
    AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2 AND 10
    AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime",
   project=project)
```

And just like with our SQL queries earlier, we can compute averages over groups.

```{r}
# average number of passengers depending of hour of day?
query_exec(
  "SELECT HOUR(pickup_datetime) AS hour, 
    AVG(passenger_count) AS passengers_avg
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  GROUP BY hour
  ORDER BY hour",
  project=project, use_legacy_sql = TRUE)

# average duration per hour of day?
(res <- query_exec(
  "SELECT 
    HOUR(pickup_datetime) AS hour,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG( (dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)/1000000/60 ) AS duration_minutes
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  WHERE 
    trip_distance > 0
    AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2 AND 10
    AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
  GROUP BY hour
  ORDER BY hour",
  project=project, use_legacy_sql = TRUE))

plot(res$hour, res$duration_minutes, type="l")

# average length by day of the week?
(res <- query_exec(
  "SELECT 
    DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG( (dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)/1000000/60 ) AS duration_minutes
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  WHERE 
    trip_distance > 0
    AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2 AND 10
    AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
  GROUP BY day
  ORDER BY day",
  project=project, use_legacy_sql = TRUE))

plot(res$day, res$duration_minutes, type="l")

# average speed by day of week?
query_exec(
  "SELECT 
    DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG(
      trip_distance / 
      ( (dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)/1000000/60/60 ) ) 
      AS avg_speed
  FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
  WHERE 
    trip_distance > 0
    AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2 AND 10
    AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
  GROUP BY day
  ORDER BY day",
  project=project, use_legacy_sql = TRUE)
